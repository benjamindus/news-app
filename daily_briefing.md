### 1. Venezuela Signs Amnesty Law Enabling Release of Hundreds of Political Prisoners
*Feb 20*

> Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodríguez signed into law an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds of politicians, activists, lawyers and others detained since 1999, though the requirement for judicial approval of each case and exclusions for certain crimes have fueled skepticism among opposition groups and prisoners' rights organizations.

Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodríguez signed into law on Thursday an amnesty bill that grants general amnesty to political prisoners processed or convicted since 1999 through the present day. The law represents a significant shift in Venezuela's approach to political detention, potentially affecting hundreds of opposition figures, activists, journalists, students and others detained during protests in 2014, 2017, 2019 and beyond. According to Foro Penal, 448 prisoners have been released since January 8, but over 600 people remain detained on political grounds.

Under the new law, trial courts must approve each amnesty request within 15 days, with lawmakers allowing those abroad to have a lawyer seek amnesty on their behalf rather than forcing them to return to Venezuela. However, people convicted of human rights violations, war crimes, murder, drug trafficking and corruption do not qualify for amnesty. The requirement for judicial oversight has created significant concerns given Venezuela's historically politicized court system.

Members of Venezuela's opposition, prisoners' rights groups and relatives of long-detained individuals gave a lukewarm reception to the measure. Critics point out that the amnesty's effectiveness depends entirely on how trial courts—which have historically acted as instruments of government policy—handle applications. The law comes as Venezuela seeks to normalize relations with the international community following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro and the installation of a transitional government backed by the United States.

### 2. Poland Exits Landmine Ban Treaty, Plans Rapid Deployment System Along Eastern Border
*Feb 20*

> Poland officially withdrew from the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines on Friday, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk announcing the country will "soon" have capability to mine its eastern borders within 48 hours in case of threat from Russia or Belarus, marking Poland as the latest NATO member to abandon the 1997 treaty amid heightened security concerns.

Poland officially exited the Ottawa Convention banning the use of land mines on Friday, February 20, 2026, according to Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Poland had ratified the treaty in 2012 and completed destruction of its domestic anti-personnel mine stockpile in 2016, but security assessments following Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted a fundamental reassessment of defensive requirements. Deputy Defense Minister Paweł Zalewski stated that land mines would form a central component of a layered defensive system along the country's borders with Russia's Kaliningrad exclave to the north and Belarus to the east.

On Thursday, Tusk presented the Bluszcz or "Ivy," a hybrid mine layer designed for stealth and autonomy, which Poland plans to deploy for rapid mine deployment. The system represents cutting-edge military technology enabling Poland to establish defensive minefields far more rapidly than traditional methods. Strips of land mines might be included between other defensive physical elements making up the so-called Eastern Shield, a system of enhanced fortifications Poland has been building on its borders with Belarus and Russia since 2024.

Poland emphasized that it would only deploy mines along its borders "when there is a realistic threat of Russian aggression" and plans to domestically manufacture both anti-personnel and anti-tank mines. Last year, Warsaw joined Finland and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in announcing departure from the treaty, as countries near Russia reassess their security posture. The National Rally in France condemned the moves as "anti-democratic," though Poland maintains the decision reflects legitimate sovereign defense requirements in an increasingly dangerous security environment.

### 3. Cambodia Accuses Thailand of Ongoing Border Violations Despite Ceasefire Agreement
*Feb 19*

> Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet accused Thai forces of continuing acts of aggression along the disputed border despite a December 2025 ceasefire, with nearly 98,000 people remaining displaced across the region as the Cambodia-Thailand border dispute remains under international scrutiny following conflict that damaged the Preah Vihear temple and displaced over 550,000 at its peak.

Cambodia says Thai troops are continuing what it calls acts of aggression along the disputed border, despite a second ceasefire agreement that took effect on December 27, 2025. AFP, Reuters, and the Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asia reported on the Cambodia-Thailand conflict, including damage to Preah Vihear temple and the deployment of barbed wire and shipping containers by Thai forces in villages in Banteay Meanchey province. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has firmly rejected any attempt to alter the Cambodia-Thailand border or to occupy Cambodian territory in violation of international law.

As of early February 2026, nearly 98,000 people remain displaced across displacement sites and host communities, including over 51,000 women and 31,000 children, though around 85 per cent of displaced people—about 550,000 individuals—have returned to their places of origin following the ceasefire. The displacement crisis has created severe humanitarian challenges, with displaced populations requiring sustained support for food, shelter, medical care and livelihood restoration.

The bilateral mechanisms have gradually resumed their functions, with both sides maintaining regular and direct lines of communication between their Ministers of Defense and Chiefs of Defense Forces. Local residents have been able to gradually resume their normal lives. Hun Manet suggested that the United States-led Board of Peace could help resolve the border dispute. The dispute stems from the colonial-era demarcation of their 800km (500-mile) border, where both sides claim territory and centuries-old temple ruins.

### 4. Germany's Chancellor Merz Questions FCAS Fighter Program, Considers Additional F-35 Purchases
*Feb 19–20*

> German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested Germany could abandon the €100 billion Future Combat Air System project with France and Spain, stating Germany does not require the same next-generation fighter as nuclear-armed France, while reports indicate Berlin is weighing purchase of 35 additional U.S.-made F-35A fighter jets beyond the 35 aircraft ordered in 2022.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that Germany could abandon the FCAS project altogether, stating that France has "different needs" than Germany and Spain as a nuclear power. Speaking on the podcast Machtwechsel, Merz said Germany does not require the same next-generation fighter as France, which needs an aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons and operating from aircraft carriers. The comments represent the most serious public questioning of FCAS by a senior German official since the program began nearly a decade ago.

Germany, France and Spain have been working on the Future Combat Air System to replace the Eurofighter and Rafale jets by 2040. The programme has been stalled due to disagreements between Airbus and Dassault, with the latter claiming it could build the jet on its own if needed and calling for the bulk of the workforce to be based in France. Germany is weighing the purchase of up to 35 additional U.S.-made F-35A fighter jets beyond the 35 aircraft ordered in 2022, as the trinational FCAS program remains stalled. However, a German government spokesperson said on February 19 that there are no plans and no decision regarding additional F-35 acquisitions.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on February 19, 2026, that he and French President Emmanuel Macron had agreed to take a decision on FCAS by the end of 2026. In March 2022, Berlin decided to purchase 35 Lockheed Martin F-35s to replace the Bundeswehr's ageing Tornado fleet. The FCAS controversy represents a significant challenge to European defense integration at precisely the moment when the continent faces its most serious security threats since the Cold War.

### 5. France's Macron Plans Strategic Appointments to ECB and Bank of France Before 2027 Elections
*Feb 19–20*

> French President Emmanuel Macron is planning to appoint loyalists to over 60 ambassadorial posts and positions at the Bank of France and potentially the ECB presidency to ensure policy continuity, with ECB President Christine Lagarde reportedly considering early departure before her October 2027 mandate expires to allow Macron and German Chancellor Merz to oversee appointment of her successor before France's April 2027 presidential elections.

Macron is planning to appoint loyalists to over 60 ambassadorial posts, the head of the national auditor, and positions at the Bank of France and potentially the ECB presidency. The strategy is explicitly to ensure policy continuity regardless of who wins in April 2027, when French presidential elections will take place. Macron is constitutionally barred from running for a third term, and polls currently suggest that the far-right Rassemblement National is in pole position to secure the French presidency.

Bank of France chief François Villeroy de Galhau, who also sits on the ECB's Governing Council, recently announced his early exit. That leaves the selection of his replacement to France's Emmanuel Macron, rather than any successor from Marine Le Pen's National Rally. The most likely successor for Villeroy de Galhau is thought to be Emmanuel Moulin, a confidant of Macron as secretary-general of the Élysée Palace, who was director of the French Treasury in 2020-24.

Christine Lagarde could step down as President of the European Central Bank before her mandate expires in October 2027, reportedly aiming to vacate her Frankfurt seat months before the French presidential elections in April 2027. Stepping aside early would ensure Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz oversee the appointment of Lagarde's successor. National Rally has condemned the moves as "anti-democratic," arguing that Macron is attempting to entrench his political allies in positions that should be filled by democratically elected successors.

### 6. Major Nor'easter Threatens Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with Potentially Historic Snowfall
*Feb 20–21*

> Computer models show significant uncertainty about a potential major snowstorm developing Sunday into Monday, with the GFS model predicting a near-record snowstorm for Washington, DC and the Mid-Atlantic while the Euro model shows a much weaker system—with forecasters warning that a change of just 100-200 miles in the storm's track could determine whether major cities see a full-fledged nor'easter or just light snow.

There is significant uncertainty about a potential major snowstorm this weekend, with the GFS model predicting a near-record snowstorm for Washington, DC and the Mid-Atlantic with a bomb cyclone tracking close to the coast, while the Euro model shows a much weaker storm tracking farther offshore with lighter snow. Computer models agree a storm will begin developing off the coast of the mid-Atlantic on Sunday and could strengthen enough to be classified as a bomb cyclone through Monday. However, models diverge on the storm's exact track Sunday into Monday, which will determine who gets snow.

A change of just 100 or 200 miles could be the difference between big cities in the Northeast seeing a full-fledged nor'easter that packs significant snow and strong winds, or a storm that just brings light snow that maybe slows travel. The most likely scenario involves snow extending as far west as the Interior Northeast and Great Lakes that might slow down travel but should be manageable, with gusty winds and some coastal flooding also possible.

This comes after major cities along the I-95 corridor have already recorded above-average snow for the first time in several years this winter, due mostly to a historic and deadly January storm. The forecast should become clearer in the coming hours as the storm approaches. The potential storm has prompted emergency preparations across the region, with state and local governments pre-positioning equipment and supplies for potential snow removal and emergency response operations.

### 7. Iran Officials Admit to 'Coup de Grâce' Executions of Wounded Protesters in January Uprising
*Feb 20*

> A senior Iranian official publicly acknowledged that security forces executed wounded protesters during the nationwide uprising of January 2026, with witness accounts reporting that security forces "finished off" wounded survivors in hospitals and streets—as UN human rights experts urge Iranian authorities to immediately disclose the fate of detained individuals and halt all executions.

A senior Iranian official has publicly acknowledged that security forces executed wounded protesters during the nationwide uprising of January 2026. This shocking admission confirms long-standing accusations by the Iranian Resistance. In Rasht, security forces reportedly surrounded and trapped protesters inside the Rasht Bazaar, set it on fire, and killed people attempting to surrender or escape, while also "finishing off" wounded survivors in the streets and hospitals. Images released from morgues leave little doubt that some wounded citizens were shot in the head while hospitalized and undergoing medical treatment.

Witnesses report the abduction of wounded protesters from hospitals and the execution of injured people who were unable to move. A Karaj taxi driver described security forces loading both dead and wounded protesters into trucks without distinction, stating "Even the wounded were not separated from the dead. They piled everyone together". Iranian authorities have acknowledged 3,117 deaths and approximately 3,000 arrests, whereas human rights organizations estimate these figures to be in the tens of thousands. Between 30,000 and 36,500 protesters were reportedly killed during January 8-9.

Human rights organizations report a dramatic surge in executions in early February—a spike that comes just weeks after nationwide protests erupted in January. UN human rights experts issued a statement on February 20, 2026, urging Iranian authorities to immediately disclose the fate of detained individuals and halt all executions. Additionally, 113 Nobel Laureates urged global action on Iran, condemning the killings and execution surge in a letter calling for international accountability measures.

### 8. Indonesia and Freeport-McMoRan Reach Agreement on Mining Rights Extension Through 2041
*Feb 19*

> Freeport-McMoRan announced a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government to extend operational rights for its subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041, with FCX agreeing to transfer 12 percent of its stake to government interests at no cost by 2041, reducing its ownership from 48.76 percent to around 37 percent starting in 2042.

Freeport-McMoRan announced on Thursday, February 19, 2026, that it had signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the extension of the mining permit at the Grasberg mine, including an agreement to transfer 12 percent of its stake in PT Freeport Indonesia to government interests at no cost. FCX will maintain its current ownership in PTFI at 48.76 percent until 2041 and hold around 37 percent starting in 2042. By 2041, Freeport will transfer a 12% interest in PT Freeport Indonesia to government entities at no cost, contingent on reimbursement for pro-rata costs incurred, based on book value for investments benefiting the post-2041 period.

Freeport-McMoRan reached a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government to extend the operational rights for its subsidiary, PT Freeport Indonesia, in the Grasberg minerals district, with amendments to its special mining business license allowing for a life of resource extension. As part of this agreement, PT Freeport Indonesia plans to enhance community support in Papua with financial backing for a new hospital and two medical educational institutions.

The agreement represents a significant milestone in Indonesia-Freeport relations, securing extended mining rights at one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits while increasing Indonesian government ownership in the operations. The Grasberg mine in Papua has been a source of both tremendous wealth and ongoing controversy, with environmental concerns, indigenous rights issues, and questions about revenue distribution creating tensions between the company, local communities, and the Indonesian government for decades.

### 9. Tata Group Signs OpenAI as First Customer for Data Center Business, Plans 1 Gigawatt Buildout
*Feb 18–19*

> OpenAI will become the first customer of India's Tata Consultancy Services' data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of AI-ready capacity and plans to scale to 1 gigawatt, as part of the global $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative—while Tata plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to hundreds of thousands of employees in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally.

OpenAI has partnered with India's Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The deal is part of the global AI infrastructure initiative Stargate, which is a $500 billion multi-year initiative to build AI data centres for training and inference, backed by major investors. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally.

Additionally, the conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services, in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. The dual nature of the partnership—with Tata both providing infrastructure for OpenAI and adopting OpenAI's technology for its own operations—demonstrates the comprehensive strategic alignment between the two organizations.

These announcements were made at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi in mid-February 2026, representing major infrastructure investments by US tech companies in India's growing AI ecosystem. The partnership comes as India positions itself as a major hub for AI development and deployment, with the government actively encouraging foreign investment in technology infrastructure while simultaneously developing domestic AI capabilities through initiatives like the Digital India program.

### 10. Google Announces $15 Billion "America-India Connect" Subsea Cable Initiative
*Feb 18–19*

> Google announced a $15 billion investment over five years to connect India with the United States through new subsea cables as part of "America-India Connect," establishing a new international gateway in Visakhapatnam and three new subsea paths connecting India to Singapore, South Africa, and Australia—representing the first direct India-US undersea cable link.

The project, called "America-India Connect," includes multiple new undersea routes connecting the United States, India and additional Southern Hemisphere markets. In collaboration with local partners, America-India Connect will establish a new international subsea gateway in Visakhapatram (Vizag); three new subsea paths connecting India to Singapore, South Africa, and Australia; and four strategic fiber-optic routes. At present, most global internet traffic flows through undersea cables routed via hubs such as West Asia or Singapore, as there is no direct India-US link.

Google has announced that it will connect India with the US through new subsea cables as part of a 15 billion dollar investment spread over five years. The investment represents one of Google's largest infrastructure commitments globally and reflects the company's assessment that India will become a critical hub for AI development, cloud computing, and digital services over the coming decade.

These announcements were made at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi in mid-February 2026, where Google also announced partnerships with Indian research institutions for DeepMind collaboration and commitments to support AI education and training programs across India. The subsea cable investment addresses a critical infrastructure gap that has long limited India's ability to compete with other major technology hubs in terms of network latency and bandwidth capacity for data-intensive applications.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump Tariffs, Markets Rally as $175 Billion in Import Taxes Nullified
*Feb 20*

> The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Trump overstepped his authority in ordering tariffs on nearly everything the U.S. imports, striking down more than $175 billion in collected tariffs under the reciprocal tariff program and emergency-powers tariffs addressing fentanyl trafficking—prompting Trump to announce a new 10% "global tariff" within hours of the ruling as stocks rose modestly on the decision.

The Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority by invoking a federal emergency-powers law to impose his "reciprocal" tariffs across the globe as well as targeted import taxes the administration says address fentanyl trafficking. At stake is more than $175 billion in tariffs that have been collected under this law. The court said Trump exceeded his authority by invoking emergency powers for what the majority characterized as routine trade policy rather than genuine national emergencies.

The market response was relatively muted despite the ruling's magnitude. The S&P 500 advanced 0.69% and closed at 6,909.51, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and settled at 22,886.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 230.81 points, or 0.47%, and ended at 49,625.97. Market watchers noted that this ruling, despite its $175 billion size, was so broadly expected by the market that it was already priced in. Treasuries and a Bloomberg gauge of the dollar fell, while stocks rallied, after the court struck down Trump's sweeping global tariffs.

President Donald Trump denounced Supreme Court justices who ruled against him as a "disgrace" and announced wide-ranging new tariffs hours after the high court struck down most of his existing import taxes. Trump said Friday he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% "global tariff," hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping "reciprocal" import duties. The rapid response demonstrates that while the Supreme Court may have rejected Trump's legal authority under emergency powers statutes, the president retains substantial authority to impose tariffs through other mechanisms.

### 2. U.S. GDP Growth Slows Sharply to 1.4% in Q4 as Government Shutdown Impacts Economy
*Feb 20*

> The U.S. economy expanded at an annualized 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, far below the 2.5% gain that economists had anticipated and marking a sharp deceleration from Q3's 4.4% growth rate—with the Commerce Department attributing much of the weakness to the record-breaking government shutdown that disrupted economic activity across multiple sectors.

Traders received a downbeat view on growth of the U.S. economy, as gross domestic product increased 1.4% for the fourth quarter. That was far below the 2.5% gain that economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. The record-breaking government shutdown is largely to blame, according to the Commerce Department. The sharp slowdown from Q3's 4.4% growth rate represents one of the most dramatic quarterly decelerations in recent years absent a recession.

The GDP data presents a complex picture for Federal Reserve policymakers who must balance slowing growth against inflation that remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. The simultaneous release of December PCE inflation data showing core prices rising 0.4% month-over-month—which would push year-over-year core PCE to approximately 3.0%—creates a particularly challenging environment. The combination of weak growth and elevated inflation evokes uncomfortable parallels to the stagflation of the 1970s, though most economists argue current conditions remain far from that historical benchmark.

The weak GDP reading has significant political implications as well. The government shutdown that contributed to the slowdown was driven by the Trump administration's efforts to implement spending cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency, creating a scenario where fiscal austerity measures intended to improve long-term fiscal sustainability may have contributed to near-term economic weakness. Market analysts expect volatility to persist as investors grapple with conflicting signals about economic momentum, inflation trajectory, and the appropriate path for monetary policy.

### 3. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.01%, Lowest Level Since September 2022, as Spring Buying Season Approaches
*Feb 19*

> The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, down from 6.09% the previous week and marking the lowest level in more than three years, while the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35%—spurring a jump in weekly purchase applications and refinance activity as homebuyers gain improved affordability heading into the spring sales season.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, 2026, down from last week when it averaged 6.09%. This represents the lowest level in more than three years. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35%, down from last week when it averaged 5.44%. A year ago at this time, the 30-year FRM averaged 6.85%, showing rates have declined significantly year-over-year.

Weekly purchase applications and refinance activity have jumped, underscoring the benefits for both buyers and current owners. It appears that housing activity is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season. Borrowers taking out a $450,000 loan at today's lower rates could shave more than $200 off their mortgage payment compared to a year ago. The improvement in affordability comes at a critical time for the housing market, which has struggled with severely constrained inventory and declining transaction volumes throughout much of 2025.

After several years of tight inventory and competitive bidding, the housing market in 2026 looks more balanced. Inventory is rising in many parts of the country, homes are taking a little longer to sell, and sellers are gradually adjusting pricing expectations. The shift isn't dramatic, but it's consistent and it's creating more negotiating room than buyers have had in recent years. Many forecasts predict mortgage rates will decrease gradually through 2026, though this decline may be slow and short-term rate increases remain possible depending on inflation and Federal Reserve policy decisions.

### 4. Warner Bros. Discovery Reopens Paramount Merger Talks After Netflix Grants Limited Waiver
*Feb 17*

> Warner Bros. Discovery reopened deal talks with Paramount after Netflix granted a limited waiver extending through February 23 for WBD to negotiate with the studio, setting up a climactic week in media consolidation as Paramount has offered to pay $31 per share versus Netflix's agreed $27.75 per share deal that faces shareholder vote on March 20.

Warner Bros. Discovery reopened talks with Paramount Skydance on February 17, 2026, giving the studio until February 24 to make its "best and final offer". A senior Paramount representative informed a WBD board member that it would pay $31 per share if deal talks were to reopen. Netflix switched to an all-cash offer valued at $82.7 billion in December 2025, with the deal valuing the studio and streaming assets at $27.75 per share, excluding cable channels like CNN. WBD set a special shareholder meeting on March 20 to vote on the Netflix deal.

Paramount CEO David Ellison responded to Netflix's bid by going directly to shareholders with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, including CNN. Paramount launched a hostile tender offer for $30 a share in cash for all of WBD. On February 9, 2026, Paramount certified that it has substantially complied with the U.S. Department of Justice's "second request" for information related to its tender offer to acquire WBD shares. Paramount enhanced its offer by injecting a $0.25-per-share "ticking fee" payable to WBD shareholders for each quarter its transaction has not closed beyond December 31, 2026, equivalent to about $650 million in cash value each quarter.

The bidding war represents one of the highest-stakes media consolidation battles in decades, with implications for the future structure of Hollywood studios, streaming services, and traditional cable television. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos granted the waiver while publicly stating "let them make a move," suggesting confidence that WBD's board will ultimately recommend the Netflix deal despite Paramount's higher nominal price. The outcome will significantly reshape the media landscape and could trigger additional consolidation as companies seek scale to compete in an increasingly challenging streaming environment.

### 5. Federal Reserve Minutes Reveal Division on Rate Path, Some Officials Consider Potential Hikes
*Feb 18*

> Federal Reserve meeting minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC session revealed deeper divisions among policymakers than previously understood, with some officials advocating for "more two-sided language" on future rate moves and explicitly raising the possibility of rate hikes—not just cuts—if economic conditions warrant, pushing market expectations for first rate cut beyond mid-2026.

Treasury yields rose for a third consecutive session on Thursday, with the 10-year note climbing to 4.087% and the 2-year note reaching 3.47%, as markets digested Federal Reserve meeting minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC session that revealed deeper divisions among policymakers than previously understood. While the decision to hold rates steady at 3.5-3.75% was broadly supported, the minutes showed some officials advocating for "more two-sided language" on future rate moves, explicitly raising the possibility of rate hikes—not just cuts—if economic conditions warrant.

The hawkish tone in the minutes significantly reduced expectations for near-term monetary easing. CME FedWatch probabilities for a March 2026 rate cut fell to below 5%, with the first fully-priced cut now expected no earlier than June 2026, and even that remains conditional on economic data showing meaningful disinflation. Several policymakers emphasized that sticky inflation readings and a still-solid labor market make any near-term cut premature, while others noted that lagged effects of previous tightening and uncertain tariff environment justify keeping cuts on the table.

The meeting was the first for a new voting cast of regional presidents, at least two of whom, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland, have publicly said they think the Fed should be on hold indefinitely, as both see inflation as a continuing threat. With the Fed already split along ideological lines, the fissure could grow deeper if former Governor Kevin Warsh is confirmed as the next central bank chair. The 10-year note finished at 4.08%, the 2-year note ended at 3.48%, and the 30-year note ended at 4.72% on February 20, 2026.

### 6. U.S. Dollar Index Falls to 97.79 After Supreme Court Tariff Ruling, Down 8.27% Year-Over-Year
*Feb 20*

> The DXY exchange rate fell to 97.79 on February 20, down 0.14% from the previous session, as the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Trump's global tariffs—with the dollar down 8.27% over the last 12 months despite staging a ferocious mid-February rebound from a four-year low of 95.5 hit on January 30.

The DXY exchange rate fell to 97.7908 on February 20, 2026, down 0.14% from the previous session. After plunging to a four-year low of 95.5 on January 30, 2026, the greenback staged a ferocious mid-February rebound, climbing back toward 98.0 in less than three weeks. Over the past month, the United States Dollar has weakened 0.98%, and is down by 8.27% over the last 12 months.

The US Dollar Index eased to 97.7 on Friday, retreating from near one-month highs, after the US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's global tariffs. US GDP grew at an annualized 1.4% in Q4, below the 3% forecast, highlighting slower momentum amid tariffs and the government shutdown. The dollar's downside was limited by sticky December core PCE inflation of 3%, reinforcing expectations that the Fed will maintain a restrictive stance.

The dollar index composition includes the Euro (57.6%), Japanese Yen (13.6%), British Pound (11.9%), Canadian Dollar (9.1%), Swedish Krona (4.2%), and Swiss Franc (3.6%). The dollar's weakness over the past year reflects multiple factors including concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability, reduced confidence in dollar reserve status as central banks diversify holdings, and uncertainty about U.S. trade policy creating hedging demand for alternative currencies.

### 7. Bitcoin Retreats to $67,400 Amid Continued ETF Outflows as Market Searches for Bottom
*Feb 18–20*

> Bitcoin is trading near $67,400 as cryptocurrency markets hold steady following recent volatility, with Bitcoin ETF outflows hitting $6.8 billion and the consensus pointing toward a trading range between $64,000 and $75,000 as the market searches for a definitive bottom—while Ethereum remains range-bound between $1,900 and $2,000 through mid-February.

BTC is trading near $92k in some reports, still consolidating well below key EMAs after a sharp correction, though more recent data indicates Bitcoin falling below the psychological $70,000 mark and even testing levels near $61,000 in early February 2026. More recent data suggests Bitcoin rebounded above $68,000 as ETF outflows hit $6.8 billion and funding flips positive. The RSI near 33 on the daily timeframe signals the token is approaching the oversold threshold, indicating that its recent price losses are significantly outpacing its gains. For a confirmed bullish shift, a break above $72,000 is needed.

The consensus points toward a trading range between $64,000 and $75,000 as the market searches for a definitive bottom. The broader trend remains bearish as Bitcoin trades well below all major EMAs. As of February 2026, the broader crypto market picture remains cautiously constructive. While short-term volatility has increased, the core drivers of the ongoing bull cycle are still in place, according to analysts.

Ethereum price in February 2026 is expected to trade within the $2,000–$2,500 range as the market attempts to stabilize after the recent sharp selloff. More specifically, the Ethereum price prediction remains range-bound between $1,900 and $2,000 through February 20, 2026, unless a decisive breakout occurs. The broader trend remains bearish as ETH trades well below all major EMAs. Entering February 2026, with Ethereum prices remaining weak, Consensus Hong Kong and ETHDenver have become key indicators that may determine whether the ecosystem can recover against headwinds.

### 8. Asian Markets Show Mixed Performance as Nikkei Consolidates Near Record Highs
*Feb 13–16*

> Japan's Nikkei 225 finished at 56,941.97 on February 13 after briefly touching 58,000, consolidating near record highs following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 26,705.94 on February 16—with Japan's index posting year-to-date gains of 12.0% and Hong Kong gaining 5.5% through early February.

Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.21% and finished at 56,941.97 on February 13, 2026, after briefly touching 58,000 on Thursday. The index had previously reached record highs, with the Nikkei 225 rising 2.28% to a new closing high of 57,650.54 on February 10, 2026. Stock purchases helped drive the Nikkei average to a record after the Takaichi-led LDP's win, with market participants viewing the election outcome as providing political stability that could support continued economic reforms and corporate governance improvements.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.71% in its final hour of trade on February 13. Earlier in February, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.58% and ended at 27,183.15 on February 10. As of February 16, the Hang Seng closed at 26,705.94, up 138.82 (+0.52%). Japan's Nikkei 225 was in the top spot with a year-to-date gain of 12.0%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was in second with a year-to-date gain of 5.5% through February 9, 2026.

The Japanese market has been riding positive momentum following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide victory in the Lower House, while Asian markets overall have been tracking broader global market trends and AI-related sentiment shifts. The divergence in performance between Japanese and Hong Kong markets reflects different economic fundamentals and investor sentiment, with Japan benefiting from corporate reforms and political stability while Hong Kong faces ongoing concerns about China's economic trajectory and regulatory environment.

### 9. Pakistan Delays $250 Million Panda Bond Issuance Again, Now Expected in March
*Feb 11*

> Pakistan postponed its first-ever Panda bond issuance in China's domestic capital market for the fourth time due to incomplete preparations by the Ministry of Finance, with the $250 million yuan-denominated green bond now expected in March 2026 after missing the February target—representing Pakistan's return to global bond markets after repayment stress.

Pakistan was preparing to issue its first-ever Panda bond in China's domestic capital market, with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb initially targeting completion before Chinese New Year in February 2026, with a debut size equivalent to $250 million in Chinese yuan. However, the bond issuance has been delayed for the fourth time due to incomplete preparations by the Ministry of Finance, with the February plan now deferred. The bonds were initially planned for launch in the first week of February, but incomplete internal preparations led to the delay, with the Ministry of Finance remaining optimistic about launching the bonds next month.

The bond was announced to be a green Panda bond targeting $250 million to support sustainable, climate-resilient investment. Pakistan hoped to launch the inaugural Panda bond before Chinese New Year, with access to China's capital market helping reduce reliance on dollar-denominated borrowing. Two non-deal roadshows had already been completed and credit enhancement was approved by the Asian Development Bank, with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank expected to follow.

The most recent reports from February 2026 indicate the issuance has been delayed again, now expected in March 2026. The delays highlight the challenges Pakistan faces in accessing international capital markets despite improvement in its overall economic situation from the near-default conditions of 2023. Successfully completing the Panda bond issuance would mark an important milestone in Pakistan's financial recovery and demonstrate renewed confidence from international investors in the country's economic trajectory.

### 10. Core PCE Inflation Expected at 3.0% Year-Over-Year as Friday Data Dump Approaches
*Feb 19–20*

> Wall Street is bracing for Friday's simultaneous release of Q4 2025 GDP, December PCE inflation, and personal income/spending data, with core PCE expected at 0.4% month-over-month which would push year-over-year core PCE to approximately 3.0%—well above the Fed's 2% target and potentially eliminating any possibility of rate cuts before summer.

The economic calendar for Friday, February 20 features three critical data releases scheduled simultaneously: the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish the advance estimate of Q4 2025 GDP growth, December PCE inflation reading (the Fed's preferred inflation gauge), and December personal income/spending data. The consolidated data dump represents what MarketMinute analysts described as an "inflection point" for first-half 2026 monetary policy, with potential to either validate Fed rate cut expectations for mid-year or push them significantly further out.

Consensus estimates call for Q4 GDP growth of 2.8% annualized, a notable cooling from Q3's 4.4% but still comfortably above the 1.8-2.0% "neutral" rate economists associate with non-inflationary growth. Core PCE is expected at 0.4% month-over-month, which if realized would push year-over-year core PCE to approximately 3.0%—a sharp acceleration from late 2025's 0.2% monthly readings and well above the Fed's 2% target. The combination of solid growth and reaccelerating inflation would validate the FOMC's hawkish pause and likely eliminate any possibility of rate cuts before summer.

The stakes are particularly high given the federal government shutdown that disrupted December economic activity and DOGE-driven spending cuts expected to register in GDP data. A reading below 1.5% combined with PCE above 2.8% would present a stagflation scenario—slowing growth with sticky inflation—that would leave the Fed paralyzed between competing mandates. Conversely, if growth proves stronger than expected while inflation moderates, markets could interpret that as a "Goldilocks" outcome justifying gradual rate cuts starting mid-year.
