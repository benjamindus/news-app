### 1. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Assassinated in Libya, Thousands Mourn at Funeral
*Feb 3-6*

> Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, was assassinated on February 3 by four masked gunmen at his home in Zintan, Libya, triggering the largest funeral in Libyan history as thousands gathered in Bani Walid to mourn the controversial political figure who remained wanted by the International Criminal Court.

Four masked gunmen raided Gaddafi's residence in Zintan after disabling security cameras in a predawn assault. The 53-year-old politician, who had been his father's de facto number two from 2000 until the 2011 Libyan civil war, was killed in what his political team described as a "cowardly and treacherous assassination." The assailants shut down the property's security cameras before storming the house, executing Gaddafi in an operation that bore the hallmarks of a planned hit rather than a spontaneous attack.

Libya's Public Prosecution Office in Tripoli announced an official investigation into the assassination, though early reports from the region suggested conflicting accounts about who was responsible. Some sources indicated potential involvement by France and the United Kingdom, though these claims remained unverified. Gaddafi had been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2011 on two counts of crimes against humanity for "murder and persecution" related to his role in suppressing opposition protests during the Libyan uprising that toppled his father's regime.

On February 6, thousands of Libyans attended Gaddafi's funeral in Bani Walid, marking what observers described as the biggest funeral in Libya's history. The massive turnout reflected both lingering support for the Gaddafi family among certain tribal groups and broader disillusionment with Libya's fragmented post-2011 political landscape. The assassination eliminates one of the few remaining figures with potential claim to national leadership based on the pre-revolution order, further complicating efforts to achieve political reconciliation in a country divided among rival governments, militias, and foreign-backed factions.

### 2. Nigeria Gunmen Kill Nearly 200 in Deadliest Violence Since 2023 Across Kwara and Katsina States
*Feb 4-5*

> Nearly 200 people were killed in coordinated attacks by suspected jihadist gunmen across Nigeria's Kwara and Katsina states on February 4, marking the deadliest outbreak of violence in the region in months as militants demanded residents abandon allegiance to the Nigerian government in favor of Sharia law.

Gunmen stormed the community of Woro in Kwara State on Tuesday evening, killing at least 170 people in the deadliest assault recorded this year in the district bordering Niger state. Residents told Reuters the gunmen, thought to be jihadists who often preached in the village, rounded up locals, bound their hands behind their backs, and executed them after demanding they switch allegiance from the Nigerian state to Sharia Islamic law. When villagers resisted these demands, the militants opened fire indiscriminately, targeting men, women, and children in a massacre that left entire families decimated.

A separate attack in Katsina State in northern Nigeria killed an additional 21 people, with gunmen moving from house to house murdering residents in a systematic pattern of violence. The coordinated nature of the attacks across two states suggested a level of planning and organization that alarmed Nigerian security officials. The violence represents an escalation in tactics by insurgent groups operating in Nigeria's northwest and north-central regions, where criminal gangs and jihadist militants have intensified operations amid weakened government control.

President Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced the deployment of an army battalion to Kwara State, with the military command spearheading an effort codenamed Operation Savannah Shield "to checkmate the barbaric terrorists and protect defenceless communities." The military response reflects growing pressure on the Nigerian government to address deteriorating security conditions in rural areas where state presence has eroded. The attacks have displaced thousands of residents who fled to neighboring communities and urban centers, adding to Nigeria's already severe humanitarian crisis in the region.

### 3. Japan's LDP Wins Historic Supermajority in Snap Election Under PM Sanae Takaichi
*Feb 8*

> Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party secured 316 seats in the February 8 House of Representatives election, giving Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's party the highest proportion of Lower House seats of any party in postwar Japanese history, just four months into her tenure following the party's coalition with the Japan Innovation Party.

The LDP's landslide victory represents a dramatic political comeback, with the party winning 316 seats compared to its pre-election total of 198 seats. Together with its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party (JIP), the bloc won 352 seats out of 465 total, significantly expanding its majority beyond the 233 required for control. The results give Takaichi, who became Prime Minister on October 21, 2025 after winning the LDP presidential election, an unprecedented mandate to pursue her policy agenda.

Takaichi had called the snap election in hopes of attracting sufficient votes to put her party back in the majority following a period of political uncertainty. The gamble paid off spectacularly, with the LDP achieving its strongest electoral performance in decades. The victory consolidates Takaichi's position as Japan's first long-term female Prime Minister and provides her government with the political capital to advance controversial policies including constitutional revision, increased defense spending, and economic stimulus measures.

The opposition Central Reform Alliance, composed of the former Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito (the LDP's former coalition partner), secured between 37 and 91 seats according to final tallies, a crushing defeat that leaves opposition parties fragmented and demoralized. The election results signal voter acceptance of Takaichi's nationalist conservative agenda and her administration's approach to managing Japan's economic challenges, demographic decline, and regional security concerns amid rising tensions with China and North Korea. International observers noted the election could embolden Japan to take a more assertive role in Indo-Pacific security architecture.

### 4. Iran Sentences Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi to Seven Additional Years in Prison
*Feb 8*

> Iranian authorities sentenced 2023 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to seven additional years and six months in prison on Saturday, along with two years of internal exile and a travel ban, as the imprisoned human rights activist remains in deteriorating health following a hunger strike protesting her detention.

A Revolutionary Court in Mashhad handed down the sentence on Saturday, which includes six years imprisonment for assembly and collusion against national security and 1.5 years for propaganda against the government. The court also punished Mohammadi with two years of internal exile in the remote city of Khusf and a two-year travel ban, penalties that will run concurrently with her existing 13 years and nine months sentence on previous charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran's government.

Mohammadi had been arrested in December at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate based in Mashhad. Supporters said Mohammadi began a hunger strike on February 2 to protest her detention and the broader crackdown on dissent in Iran, though she ended the nearly week-long hunger strike over the weekend amid concerns about her deteriorating health. The Nobel laureate won the 2023 Peace Prize while imprisoned for her campaign to advance women's rights and abolish the death penalty in Iran.

The additional sentence comes amid Iran's brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that began in late 2025, with human rights groups documenting thousands of deaths and arrests. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) documented a total of 18,571 cases as of February 5, 2026, including 6,941 confirmed deaths—at least 6,495 of them protesters—with 11,630 additional cases under review. Estimates of the total number of protesters killed range from 2,000 to 20,000, making it one of the deadliest government crackdowns in modern Iranian history.

### 5. UK Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Resigns Over Mandelson Ambassador Appointment Amid Epstein Scandal
*Feb 8*

> British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney resigned on Sunday, taking full responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as U.K. ambassador to the United States despite Mandelson's documented links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, triggering the gravest crisis of Starmer's 18-month premiership.

McSweeney's resignation followed the January 30 release of court files in the United States that revealed the depth of Labour veteran Peter Mandelson's relationship with Epstein. The files sparked a police investigation for misconduct in office over indications that Mandelson leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he served as a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010. The scandal has put Starmer's judgment and vetting processes under intense scrutiny less than two years after Labour won one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern British history.

In a statement, McSweeney said: "The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself. When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice." The resignation represents a significant political blow to Starmer, as McSweeney was instrumental in the Labour leader's rise to power and served as his principal strategist throughout the successful 2024 general election campaign.

The controversy has triggered widespread criticism from across the political spectrum, with opposition parties demanding Starmer withdraw Mandelson's appointment and explain how such serious allegations were not identified during the vetting process. Political analysts described the scandal as Starmer's most perilous moment yet, potentially undermining his carefully cultivated image as a leader committed to integrity and accountability. The loss of McSweeney leaves Starmer without his most trusted advisor at a critical juncture when the government faces economic headwinds, public sector strikes, and increasingly fractious relations with the Trump administration.

### 6. Canada and France Open Greenland Consulates in Show of Support Against U.S. Annexation Threats
*Feb 6*

> Canada and France inaugurated diplomatic consulates in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, on Friday in a strong demonstration of support for NATO ally Denmark following President Donald Trump's repeated insistence on securing control of the Arctic island, with France becoming the first European Union country to establish a consulate general in Greenland.

Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand traveled to Nuuk to open Canada's consulate, accompanied by Indigenous Governor General Mary Simon, with officials stating the mission could enhance cooperation on climate change and Inuit rights. France's Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs announced that Jean-Noel Poirier would take up duties as consul general, marking a significant diplomatic development as the first EU member state to establish such a presence in the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

The consulate openings come as President Trump has backed off recent threats to seize Greenland militarily, following what he described as a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater U.S. influence in the strategically vital Arctic region. A U.S.-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington's security concerns, though details have not been made public. Trump has cited security concerns and Arctic sovereignty as justifications for seeking control of Greenland, which hosts important U.S. military installations including Thule Air Base.

The Franco-Canadian diplomatic moves signal European determination to reinforce Danish sovereignty over Greenland and resist unilateral U.S. actions that could destabilize the Arctic security framework. Greenland, which has significant autonomy within the Danish realm but relies on Copenhagen for defense and foreign affairs, sits at the center of intensifying great power competition as climate change opens new shipping routes and resource extraction opportunities in the Arctic. The consulate openings represent a carefully calibrated response that affirms allied support for Denmark while avoiding direct confrontation with the Trump administration.

### 7. Pentagon Cuts Academic Ties with Harvard Over "Woke" Ideology Concerns
*Feb 6-7*

> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on February 6 that the Pentagon will end all professional military education, fellowships, and certificate programs with Harvard University starting in the 2026-27 school year, declaring the institution "no longer meets the needs of the War Department" and criticizing the Ivy League school for promoting "globalist and radical ideologies."

Hegseth stated that "For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks." The announcement affects military education programs across multiple services, though personnel currently attending classes at Harvard will be permitted to finish their courses.

The decision marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration's prolonged confrontation with Harvard over demands for institutional reforms. The standoff has included threats to revoke federal research funding, investigations into alleged discrimination in admissions practices, and public criticism of the university's handling of campus protests related to Middle East policy. The Pentagon's move represents the most concrete action taken against the institution to date.

Harvard has not yet issued a detailed public response to the Pentagon's decision, though university officials privately expressed concern that the move politicizes military education and could harm national security by limiting the intellectual development of future military leaders. Critics of Hegseth's decision, including some retired senior military officers, argued that exposure to diverse academic perspectives strengthens rather than weakens military leadership, and that the decision reflects ideological litmus testing inappropriate for educational policy.

### 8. Federal Court Rules Trump Administration's Secret Climate Panel Violated Law
*Jan 30-Feb 4*

> A U.S. District Court in Massachusetts ruled on January 30 that the Trump administration violated federal law when it secretly formed a "Climate Working Group" comprised of five climate change skeptics to write a report attacking climate science, with the court declaring the violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act are "now established as a matter of law."

The court's judgment determined that the Department of Energy, Secretary of Energy Wright, and the Climate Working Group violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) by forming and operating in secret without public disclosure, failing to maintain fairly balanced membership, and not making materials available to the public. The Climate Working Group was created in 2024 and tasked with writing a report that the Trump administration subsequently used as justification for proposing to overturn the EPA's Endangerment Finding—the scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare.

The Federal Advisory Committee Act was passed by Congress after Nixon-era scandals to prevent federal government advisory committees from forming or operating in secret. The law requires that advisory groups have fairly balanced membership and that materials created by such groups be available to the public. Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed the lawsuit alleging the Climate Working Group's creation violated these fundamental transparency and accountability requirements.

The ruling carries significant implications for the Trump administration's broader efforts to repeal climate protections based on the Climate Working Group's report. Legal experts suggested the decision could invalidate regulatory changes predicated on the group's conclusions, forcing the administration to restart policy development processes using properly constituted advisory bodies. The case highlights ongoing tensions between the administration's climate policy agenda and federal laws designed to ensure scientific integrity and public accountability in government decision-making.

### 9. Indonesia and Australia Sign Historic Security Treaty on Common Defense
*Feb 6*

> Indonesia and Australia signed a landmark security treaty on February 6 committing both nations to consult each other if either faces external threats, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and President Prabowo Subianto describing the Australia-Indonesia Treaty on Common Security as taking defense cooperation to unprecedented levels and reflecting deep bilateral trust.

The treaty was signed in Jakarta on Friday, modeled after a 1995 security agreement between the two countries but significantly expanded in scope. While full details have not been disclosed, the pact commits Australia and Indonesia to mutual consultation in the event of threats to either nation's security, though it stops short of constituting a formal mutual defense alliance requiring automatic military assistance. The agreement represents the most significant bilateral defense commitment between the often-testy neighbors in decades.

Prime Minister Albanese announced supporting initiatives including development of joint defense training facilities in Indonesia, establishment of a new embedded position for a senior Indonesian military officer in the Australian Defence Force, and expansion of the Junior Leaders' Forum Military Education Exchange to build ties between future military leaders. The measures aim to institutionalize defense cooperation beyond individual programs and create lasting structural linkages between the two militaries.

The treaty reflects both nations' assessment of growing regional security challenges, particularly concerning Chinese military expansion in the South China Sea and broader Indo-Pacific power competition. For Australia, the agreement diversifies security partnerships beyond traditional alliances with the United States and other Five Eyes nations. For Indonesia, historically committed to non-alignment, the treaty signals willingness to accept greater security interdependence with a Western-aligned power while maintaining strategic autonomy. Regional analysts noted the treaty could serve as a template for other Southeast Asian nations seeking to balance relations between Washington and Beijing.

### 10. Bangladesh Faces Election Violence as February 12 Parliamentary Vote Approaches
*Feb 8-12*

> Bangladesh's February 12 parliamentary elections are proceeding amid escalating political violence that has killed at least 16 activists since the vote was announced in December, with authorities deploying 900,000 security personnel including 108,730 military members to protect 42,761 polling centers in the country's first election since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.

Widespread political violence has troubled Bangladesh's election preparations, with leaders from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jamaat-e-Islami, and other opposition parties killed in recent weeks. About 900,000 personnel will be deployed from February 8-14 to ensure security, with more than half of the country's polling centers classified as risky and receiving the bulk of additional security forces. The massive security deployment reflects the government's assessment that violence could escalate further as election day approaches.

A spate of recent attacks has amplified fears among Bangladesh's religious minorities, particularly the Hindu community, ahead of the February 12 vote. While the government insists most incidents have been ordinary crimes, minority leaders have documented a pattern of targeted intimidation and violence they attribute to political motives. The climate of fear has led some minority voters to question whether they can safely participate in the electoral process.

The election represents Bangladesh's first parliamentary vote since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party ruled for over a decade until mass protests forced her from power in 2025. Hasina, now in exile in India, has denounced the upcoming election and her party faces a ban from participating. The exclusion of the Awami League—historically one of Bangladesh's two dominant parties—raises questions about the legitimacy of the electoral outcome and the possibility of post-election instability, particularly if results are disputed or if violence against Awami League supporters or Hindu minorities intensifies.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Cleveland-Cliffs and Becton Dickinson Report Earnings as February Reporting Season Continues
*Feb 9*

> Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and Becton, Dickinson and Company released Q4 2025 earnings before markets opened on Monday, February 9, with analysts expecting Cleveland-Cliffs to report a loss of $0.62 per share on $4.62 billion revenue while Becton Dickinson is forecast to post earnings of $2.82 per share on $5.15 billion revenue as 78 S&P 500 companies report this week.

Cleveland-Cliffs announced full-year and fourth-quarter 2025 earnings results before the U.S. market open on Monday, with the steelmaker hosting a conference call with securities analysts and institutional investors at 8:30 am ET. Analysts expected Cleveland-Cliffs to report a loss per share of $0.62 and $4.62 billion in revenue, reflecting ongoing challenges in the steel industry from weak demand in key end markets and elevated input costs that have compressed margins throughout 2025.

Becton, Dickinson and Company released its Q1 2026 results before market open on Monday, with the earnings call scheduled for 8:00 AM ET. Analysts expected the medical technology company to post earnings of $2.82 per share and revenue of $5.15 billion for the quarter. The results will provide insight into demand trends for medical devices, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical systems across both developed and emerging markets.

During the upcoming week, 78 S&P 500 companies (including 3 Dow 30 components) are scheduled to report results, with major corporations including Coca-Cola, CVS, AstraZeneca, and Ford releasing earnings on Tuesday, February 10. The February reporting season is being closely watched for signs of how companies are navigating a complex economic environment characterized by moderating inflation, slowing growth, and persistent consumer caution. Earnings guidance for full-year 2026 will be particularly scrutinized as investors assess whether companies can sustain profit margins amid wage pressures and potential tariff impacts.

### 2. January Jobs Report Rescheduled for February 11 Following Shutdown Delay
*Feb 4-11*

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics rescheduled the January employment report to Wednesday, February 11—five days later than originally planned—due to a government shutdown delay, with economists forecasting nonfarm payroll growth of 60,000 to 80,000 jobs and unemployment holding steady at 4.4% as labor market balance remains a critical Federal Reserve policy consideration.

The January jobs report will be released on February 11 following a government shutdown that disrupted the original release schedule. According to FactSet, nonfarm payroll employment is forecast to increase by 80,000 in January versus 50,000 in December, while economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a gain of 60,000 jobs. The wide range of estimates reflects uncertainty about seasonal adjustment factors and the impact of winter weather on hiring patterns.

The report is projected to show that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.4%, with wage growth also likely to remain stable, signaling a labor market in balance as weak hiring matches a slow-growing workforce. The jobs report is expected to show continued gradual cooling from the tight labor conditions of 2022-2023 without deteriorating into recessionary territory, a "soft landing" scenario the Federal Reserve has been attempting to engineer through its interest rate policy.

The delayed January jobs report and upcoming February 13 CPI release (showing inflation data also postponed by the shutdown) represent critical data points for Federal Reserve policymakers as they assess the appropriate path for monetary policy in 2026. Markets are currently pricing in two rate cuts for 2026, with the first likely in June, though the timing depends heavily on whether inflation continues to moderate and employment remains stable. The labor market data will be particularly important given recent weak readings on job openings and jobless claims that have raised concerns about potential deterioration.

### 3. ON Semiconductor Reports Q4 Earnings Amid Technology Sector Volatility
*Feb 9*

> ON Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, February 9, with analysts expecting earnings of $0.62 per share on revenue of $1.54 billion as the semiconductor manufacturer navigates challenges including an 11.98% revenue decline and margin pressures that have left the stock with a neutral rating from analysts.

ON Semiconductor released quarterly earnings during market hours on Monday, with the company facing heightened scrutiny amid broader semiconductor sector volatility and concerns about demand trends for automotive and industrial chips. Analysts expected the company to announce earnings of $0.62 per share and revenue of $1.54 billion for the quarter, representing continued pressure on the company's financial performance.

Examining ON Semiconductor's financials over the prior three months revealed significant challenges, with the company experiencing a revenue decline of approximately 11.98% as of September 30, 2025. Additionally, ON Semiconductor's net margin of 16.44% lags behind industry averages, suggesting difficulties in maintaining strong profitability amid competitive pressures and pricing headwinds in key markets. The company's recent performance included a +6.78% EPS surprise and +1.97% revenue surprise in its most recent prior report, though the stock price declined 3.59% following that release.

With 8 analyst ratings, ON Semiconductor has a consensus rating of Neutral with an average one-year price target of $62.12, indicating minimal expected upside from current levels. The cautious analyst stance reflects concerns about the company's exposure to automotive semiconductor markets where electric vehicle demand has moderated and traditional auto production remains sluggish. The earnings report comes as the broader semiconductor sector faces questions about the sustainability of AI-driven growth and whether infrastructure spending will translate into sustained revenue growth for chip manufacturers.

### 4. Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations Set for June as Markets Price Two Cuts in 2026
*Feb 2026*

> Financial markets are pricing in two Federal Reserve rate cuts of 25 basis points each for 2026, with the first reduction most likely in June and a second potentially in September, as policymakers balance persistent 3% inflation against signs of labor market softening and moderating economic growth.

The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady in a range between 3.5% and 3.75% at its January 2026 meeting, pausing after recent cuts and signaling a cautious approach to further easing. Futures markets are pricing in at most two rate reductions in 2026, with the Fed's own projections indicating only one rate cut for the year—less than market participants expect. The divergence between market pricing and Fed guidance reflects ongoing uncertainty about the inflation trajectory and economic resilience.

One notable outlier is Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, who expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear. Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, predicting that labor market weakness and disinflation will force the Fed's hand earlier and more aggressively than currently anticipated. However, most analysts remain skeptical of such an aggressive easing path given that inflation is still running closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% goal.

Markets are expecting the Fed to wait until at least June before adjusting its benchmark rate again, with any earlier move dependent on either a sharp deterioration in employment data or an unexpected acceleration in disinflation. The Fed faces a delicate balancing act: labor market weakness that justifies rate cuts versus persistent inflation concerns that argue for maintaining restrictive monetary policy. Federal Reserve Chair Powell has stated that the economy remains on "firm footing" and that the current rate level is not necessarily restrictive, comments that suggest the bar for further rate cuts may be higher than markets anticipate.

### 5. Dollar Strength Pressures Commodities as Gold and Silver Retreat from Record Highs
*Feb 2-9*

> A Bloomberg dollar gauge appreciated approximately 1.2% over recent sessions, pressuring commodity prices across the board as gold retreated from its record $5,594.82 per ounce peak and silver pulled back from an all-time high of $121.64, with easing geopolitical tensions and strong U.S. manufacturing data contributing to the dollar's strength.

Commodity prices fell sharply in early February, with losses spanning precious metals, oil, and industrial metals as easing geopolitical tensions and a firmer U.S. dollar prompted investors to unwind defensive positions. The mechanism is straightforward: a stronger dollar typically makes commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, dampening demand and creating selling pressure. The dollar's recent appreciation followed unexpectedly strong U.S. manufacturing data and signs of diplomatic progress on Middle East tensions.

Despite the recent pullback, precious metals had experienced extraordinary gains in January, with gold surging to a record $5,594.82 an ounce and silver reaching an all-time high of $121.64. These levels proved vulnerable to profit-taking once the dollar strengthened and immediate geopolitical crisis scenarios appeared less likely. UBS sees gold consolidating in the $4,500-4,800 per ounce range in the near term but expects it to rise to $6,200 per ounce by mid-year, supported by various factors including central bank demand, geopolitical risks, and concerns about fiscal sustainability.

Continued dollar weakness earlier in 2026 had acted as a tailwind to commodity prices, supported by fiscal concerns, geopolitical tensions, and strong demand. Market leadership shifted from mega-cap technology in 2025 as markets transitioned to a more balanced environment across market cap size and economic sectors, with commodity-linked equities benefiting from this rotation. Looking ahead, commodity price trajectories will depend heavily on the dollar's path, which in turn hinges on Federal Reserve policy decisions, U.S. economic data, and the evolution of global trade and geopolitical tensions.

### 6. Stock Market Outlook Focuses on Jobs Report and CPI Data for Week of February 9-12
*Feb 9-12*

> The week of February 9-12 will see critical economic data releases including the delayed January jobs report on Wednesday and continued corporate earnings, with markets looking for confirmation that the labor market remains stable and inflation continues moderating to support expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2026.

Monday, February 9 features earnings reports from UDR, Principal Financial Group, ON Semiconductor, Cincinnati Financial, Becton Dickinson & Co., Apollo Global Management, Waters, and Loews, with many more earnings scheduled throughout the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 for the first time ever after rallying more than 1,200 points on Friday, February 7, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped more than 2% in a broad-based rally that recovered much of the prior week's losses.

The big jobs report Wednesday is expected to show the U.S. added 60,000 jobs last month, up from an increase of 50,000 in December, with the unemployment rate forecast to stay unchanged at 4.4%. The employment data will be critical for assessing whether the labor market is achieving a sustainable balance or deteriorating in ways that might force earlier Federal Reserve intervention. January CPI data, also delayed by the shutdown, is expected to show inflation increasing 0.29% monthly and 2.5% annually, an improvement from December though still short of the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Market leadership has shifted from mega-cap technology in 2025 as markets have transitioned to a more balanced environment across market cap size and economic sectors. Additionally, continued dollar weakness has boosted commodities prices, most notably in precious metals, though this trend reversed in early February. The market is still pricing in two Fed rate cuts for 2026, more than the central bank has indicated it might deliver, setting up potential disappointment if inflation proves stickier than expected or if the Fed maintains its cautious stance on easing.

### 7. Israel Continues Air Strikes on Lebanon Despite November 2024 Ceasefire Agreement
*Feb 2-9*

> Israeli military forces struck several locations in southern Lebanon on February 2, including villages where evacuation warnings were issued, claiming to hit Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, as more than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire since the November 2024 ceasefire—with Hezbollah launching only one attack in response despite over 11,000 Israeli violations.

Israel's military struck multiple locations in south Lebanon on Monday, February 2, including in two villages where it issued evacuation warnings, claiming it was hitting Hezbollah targets. The Israeli military stated it struck "several Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in southern Lebanon, in order to prevent re-establishment attempts." The Lebanese health ministry reported that an Israeli strike on Ansariyeh in southern Lebanon killed one person and wounded four others, while another strike on Qleileh wounded an additional four people.

Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war between Israel and the Iran-backed group, Israel has kept up regular strikes on parts of Lebanon and has maintained troops in five border areas it deems strategic. More than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire, according to an AFP tally of health ministry reports. The Lebanese group Hezbollah has launched only one attack in the 14 months since the ceasefire began, despite more than 11,000 Israeli violations documented by observers.

In January, Lebanon's army announced completion of the first phase of its plan to disarm Hezbollah, covering the area south of the Litani river approximately 30 kilometers from the Israeli border. Israel, which accuses Hezbollah of rearming, has criticized the army's progress as insufficient, while Hezbollah has rejected calls to surrender its weapons entirely. The ongoing strikes and counteraccusations raise questions about the sustainability of the ceasefire and the possibility of renewed large-scale conflict if tensions continue to escalate.

### 8. 2026 Winter Olympics: Breezy Johnson Wins Downhill Gold as Lindsey Vonn Suffers Catastrophic Crash
*Feb 8*

> American skier Breezy Johnson captured gold in the women's downhill at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics on February 8, marking the first U.S. medal of the Games, in a race marred by a devastating crash involving teammate Lindsey Vonn who was competing just days after suffering an ACL tear and required emergency surgery for a broken leg.

Breezy Johnson won gold in the women's downhill race, reclaiming the narrative on the iconic Cortina slope where she crashed while training four years earlier, ending her hopes of competing in the 2022 Winter Games. Johnson's victory represented a remarkable comeback story and gave the United States its first medal of the 2026 Olympics. Hours after the event, Johnson revealed that part of her gold medal broke off while she was celebrating the victory, stating "Well, I was jumping up and down in excitement, and it fell off."

The race was marred by Lindsey Vonn's attempt to compete despite having ruptured her ACL just over a week prior. Just 13.4 seconds into her run, Vonn's right arm snagged a gate, sending her spinning in the air into a dramatic crash on the slope. Vonn was evacuated from the mountain by helicopter and required surgery on her broken left leg. The decision to allow Vonn to compete despite her recent injury has sparked intense debate about athlete safety protocols and whether medical clearances were appropriately rigorous.

The U.S. team also won gold in team figure skating on Day 2 of the Olympics, adding to the nation's medal count in the early stages of the Milan Cortina Games. The Winter Olympics continue through February 22, with competitions across alpine skiing, snowboarding, ice hockey, figure skating, and numerous other winter sports disciplines. The Games have proceeded despite concerns about warm weather affecting snow conditions at some venues and ongoing debates about the environmental sustainability of hosting winter sports events amid accelerating climate change.

### 9. Coca-Cola and Major Corporations Report Earnings Week of February 10
*Feb 10*

> Coca-Cola is scheduled to report Q4 2025 earnings on Tuesday, February 10, before market open, with analysts expecting earnings per share of $0.56 as the beverage giant navigates shifting consumer preferences, pricing power limitations, and international currency headwinds in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Coca-Cola will release Q4 2025 earnings on Tuesday, February 10, 2026, before market open, joining a wave of major corporations reporting results this week. Analysts expect the company to announce earnings of $0.56 per share, with investors closely watching for commentary on volume trends, pricing strategies, and international market performance. The earnings will provide insight into how consumer staples companies are managing the tension between maintaining margins through pricing power and preserving volume in the face of inflation-weary consumers.

Also reporting earnings on February 10 are CVS, AstraZeneca, and Ford, offering perspectives from the pharmacy retail, pharmaceutical, and automotive sectors respectively. The diverse range of reporting companies will provide a broad snapshot of the U.S. and global economy, with particular focus on consumer spending patterns, healthcare utilization trends, and automotive demand. Investors will scrutinize guidance for full-year 2026 to assess whether companies see improving conditions or continued headwinds.

The earnings season so far has been characterized by significant volatility, with software stocks experiencing historic selloffs while "old economy" sectors like materials, energy, and industrials have outperformed. Overall, 59% of S&P 500 companies that have reported to date beat earnings expectations, with 76% reporting actual EPS above mean estimates. However, the forward guidance has been mixed, with some companies expressing caution about 2026 prospects while others remain confident in sustained demand.

### 10. U.S. Stock Market Crosses 50,000 Threshold Amid Rotation from Technology to Value Sectors
*Feb 7-9*

> The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 50,000 for the first time on Friday, February 7, rallying more than 1,200 points in a session that saw the S&P 500 rise nearly 2% and the Nasdaq jump over 2%, though the S&P 500 remains in negative territory for 2026 with approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization wiped out during recent volatility.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 for the first time ever after rallying more than 1,200 points on Friday, with the S&P 500 rising nearly 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumping more than 2%. The broad-based rally represented a sharp reversal from the previous week's technology-led selloff and was driven by strength in the beaten-down tech sector alongside gains in industrials, materials, and energy. However, the S&P 500 Index remains red for 2026, having wiped out roughly $1 trillion in market capitalization during the recent volatility.

The U.S. stock market is witnessing a massive sector rotation as billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into "Old Economy" value sectors of basic materials, energy, and industrials. Small-cap value stocks are up 5.94% in 2026 compared to large-cap growth at 2.80%, representing a reversal of last year's dynamic where mega-cap technology dominated returns. Several sectors hit fresh all-time highs this week, including industrials, materials, energy, and consumer staples.

The market rotation reflects investor reassessment of which companies have sustainable business models versus those built primarily on growth narratives, with Wall Street's shift into value drawing comparisons to the dot-com bust aftermath. The volatility has been particularly acute in software stocks, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling it "the worst structural sell-off in software I've ever seen in 25 years" as fears mount that AI tools could disrupt traditional enterprise software business models. Looking ahead, the market direction will depend heavily on upcoming economic data, corporate earnings guidance, and Federal Reserve policy signals.
