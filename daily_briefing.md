## Geopolitical News (Top 10)

### 1. Trump Issues 10-Day Ultimatum to Iran as U.S. Military Readies Strike Options
*Feb 19*

> President Trump announced Thursday aboard Air Force One that he will decide within the next 10 to 15 days whether to continue diplomacy with Iran or order military strikes, as the U.S. military positions two aircraft carriers and strike assets in the Persian Gulf and national security officials confirm readiness for potential strikes as early as this weekend.

President Trump told reporters Thursday that Iran has 10 to 15 days at most to strike a nuclear deal, stating "We're either going to get a deal, or it's going to be unfortunate for them." The comments came during the Board of Peace meeting in Washington, where Trump revealed that top national security officials have briefed him that U.S. military forces are ready for potential strikes on Iran as soon as Saturday, though the timeline for any action is likely to extend beyond this weekend. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has joined existing forces in the Persian Gulf, giving Washington a full array of airstrike options.

The 10-day deadline represents the most specific timeline Trump has given for a decision on Iran, marking an escalation from previous vague warnings about military action. Iran's UN Ambassador Amir-Saeid Iravani sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Security Council members warning of Iranian retaliation if attacked. The military buildup includes fighter jets, refueling tankers, and naval assets positioned across the region, with Pentagon officials describing the deployment as providing the president with "maximum optionality" for any decision.

Oil markets responded immediately to the ultimatum, with Brent crude rising above $71 per barrel and WTI climbing to $66, as traders priced in the risk premium associated with potential disruption to the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil transits. Analysts warn that the next 10 days could determine whether this becomes the largest Middle Eastern conflict since the Iraq War, with Israeli officials reportedly preparing for a war scenario within days and urging Trump toward maximalist objectives including regime change.

### 2. Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol Sentenced to Life in Prison for Insurrection
*Feb 19*

> Former President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life imprisonment by a South Korean court on February 19 for leading a brief insurrection attempt in December 2024 when he declared martial law, marking the first time a former South Korean president has received a life sentence and the first senior British royal arrest in almost 400 years.

A South Korean court handed down a life sentence to former President Yoon Suk Yeol for his brief imposition of martial law on December 3, 2024. The court found Yoon guilty of insurrection charges stemming from his attempt to suspend democratic governance and deploy military forces against the National Assembly. Yoon had declared emergency martial law citing threats from "anti-state forces," but the parliament voted unanimously to overturn the decree within hours, and Yoon was forced to rescind the order after massive public protests erupted across Seoul.

The life sentence represents the harshest punishment ever handed to a former South Korean leader, surpassing even the imprisonment of former presidents Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak for corruption. Yoon's lawyers announced they would appeal the verdict, arguing that the martial law declaration was within his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief during what he perceived as a national emergency. Legal experts say the appeal process could take years to resolve through South Korea's court system.

The conviction has sent shockwaves through South Korean politics, where Yoon's conservative People Power Party is struggling to distance itself from the disgraced former president while maintaining its political base. The ruling comes as South Korea faces heightened tensions with North Korea and uncertainty about U.S. security commitments under the Trump administration, creating a complex domestic and international environment for interim President Han Duck-soo as the country prepares for snap elections that must be held within 60 days.

### 3. Peru Elects José María Balcázar as Eighth President in a Decade Amid Political Turmoil
*Feb 18*

> Peru's Congress elected 83-year-old former judge José María Balcázar as the country's eighth president in a decade on February 18, replacing another interim leader ousted over corruption allegations just four months into his term, with Balcázar set to govern until general elections on April 12.

Peru's Congress voted to install José María Balcázar as president after he secured 60 of 114 parliamentary votes, defeating rival candidate María del Carmen Alva in a decisive congressional ballot. Balcázar, an 83-year-old former judge representing the leftist Perú Libre party, replaces José Jerí, who was removed from office over corruption allegations related to his tenure as congressional president. Balcázar becomes Peru's ninth leader in a decade, reflecting the country's severe political instability that has seen presidents removed through impeachment, resignation, and criminal prosecution in rapid succession.

Balcázar will serve as interim president for approximately five months before handing power to the winner of Peru's April 12 general elections, in which Peruvians will choose both a new president and legislature. The abbreviated tenure limits Balcázar's ability to implement major policy changes, with his mandate effectively focused on ensuring electoral integrity and maintaining basic government functions until the transition. His Perú Libre party affiliation raises questions about whether he will attempt to influence the electoral process in favor of left-wing candidates, though congressional oversight and international election monitoring are expected to constrain such efforts.

The political crisis comes as Peru faces significant economic headwinds, including declining copper prices that threaten the country's primary export revenue, rising crime rates in Lima and other major cities, and ongoing protests in rural areas over mining projects and environmental concerns. International investors have expressed concern about Peru's governance instability, with some analysts warning that the country's investment-grade credit rating could be at risk if political chaos continues beyond the April elections.

### 4. Poland Bans Chinese-Made Vehicles from Military Sites Over Data Security Concerns
*Feb 17–19*

> Poland's Ministry of Defence announced a comprehensive ban on Chinese-manufactured vehicles entering protected military facilities, citing risk analysis showing potential for uncontrolled data acquisition through onboard sensors, cameras, and GPS systems—a decision Poland says aligns with NATO security standards as alliance members reassess technology supply chain vulnerabilities.

Poland's Ministry of Defence issued a directive banning all Chinese-manufactured vehicles from entering protected military installations, effective immediately. The ban extends to any vehicles containing technology capable of recording position, images, or sound, regardless of manufacturer country, but was explicitly prompted by security assessments of Chinese automotive technology. The ministry also prohibited Polish military personnel from connecting their work phones to infotainment systems in Chinese-made vehicles, even when those vehicles are not on military premises.

The decision follows risk analysis conducted by Poland's military intelligence services concluding that modern Chinese vehicles pose unacceptable data security risks due to the extensive array of sensors, cameras, GPS tracking, and connectivity features integrated into contemporary automotive designs. Polish officials expressed particular concern that data collected by Chinese vehicles could be transmitted to servers controlled by Chinese state entities or accessed through backdoors built into vehicle software, potentially compromising the locations of sensitive military facilities, movements of defense personnel, and security protocols.

Poland has indicated the ban is not permanent and is calling for development of a security vetting process that would allow automakers to undergo assessment and, if passed, gain permission for their vehicles to enter protected facilities. Exemptions are also available for emergency situations including state and local government inspections and rescue operations. Poland emphasized that the measures align with security practices already observed by NATO allies and other partner countries seeking to protect critical defense infrastructure from potential foreign intelligence gathering.

### 5. Sudan Drone Attacks Kill 57 Civilians in Two Days, Including 15 Children
*Feb 15–16*

> The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for urgent steps to protect civilians after at least 57 people were killed in separate drone strikes over two days across four Sudanese states, with attacks hitting a market, an IDP shelter, two schools, and a hospital as the conflict between Sudan's army and the Rapid Support Forces intensifies.

UN human rights chief Volker Türk expressed alarm after drone strikes across Sudan killed at least 57 civilians between February 15 and 16, with attacks targeting civilian infrastructure in North Kordofan, West Kordofan, South Kordofan, and Sennar states. An alleged Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) drone struck the Al Safiya market in Sudari locality, North Kordofan, on February 15, reportedly killing 28 civilians and injuring 13 others. The following day, an alleged SAF drone struck a shelter for internally displaced persons in Al Sunut, West Kordofan, killing 26 civilians including 15 children.

Additional attacks included alleged Rapid Support Forces (RSF) drones hitting two primary schools in Dilling, South Kordofan, with casualties not yet determined, and an alleged RSF drone strike on Al-Mazmoun Hospital in Sennar State on February 15, killing at least three civilians and injuring seven others including a medical worker. The UN described the attacks as "yet another reminder of the devastating consequences on civilians of the escalating use of drone warfare in Sudan," calling on all parties to the conflict to take immediate steps to protect civilian populations and civilian infrastructure.

The drone strikes represent a significant escalation in the lethality of Sudan's civil war, which began in April 2023 when fighting erupted between the national army and the RSF paramilitary group. Over 30 countries have expressed alarm at the mounting civilian toll, with humanitarian organizations warning that the systematic targeting of markets, hospitals, and displacement shelters may constitute war crimes. The conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, with more than 8 million people displaced and famine conditions emerging in multiple regions.

### 6. British Police Arrest Former Prince Andrew on Misconduct Charges Related to Epstein Files
*Feb 19*

> Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Prince Andrew, was arrested by Thames Valley Police on his 66th birthday on suspicion of misconduct in public office related to allegations he shared confidential UK trade documents with Jeffrey Epstein in 2010, marking the first arrest of a senior British royal in almost 400 years before being released under investigation.

Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on February 19 following investigation into claims that he shared confidential government documents with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while serving as UK trade envoy in 2010. The arrest came after files released in posthumous documents suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore, and other countries he visited on official trade missions, potentially compromising British commercial interests and diplomatic relations.

King Charles released a statement expressing "deepest concern" about his brother's arrest and emphasizing that "the law must take its course" through full and proper investigation by appropriate authorities. The former prince was released from police custody late Thursday under investigation, meaning he has not been charged but remains subject to ongoing criminal inquiry. Legal experts note that misconduct in public office is a serious criminal charge in British law that can carry significant prison sentences if proven, particularly when involving potential compromise of state interests.

The arrest represents a dramatic fall for a figure who was once second in line to the British throne. King Charles had already stripped Andrew of his royal titles and evicted him from his longtime residence near Windsor Castle in October 2025 following publication of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir detailing her allegations against Andrew. The criminal investigation adds a new dimension to Andrew's legal troubles, with potential implications not just for his personal freedom but also for the broader reputation of the British monarchy during a period of significant public scrutiny.

### 7. Russia Intensifies Covert Hybrid Warfare Across Europe with Sabotage Attacks
*Feb 18*

> Russia is stepping up covert attacks across Europe including rail sabotage, drone incursions, and cyberstrikes in what military experts describe as hybrid warfare designed to test NATO response capabilities, sow fear, and undermine support for Ukraine—with Polish officials warning that Moscow is using "disposable agents" to conduct operations while maintaining plausible deniability.

Russia's hybrid warfare campaign against Europe has escalated sharply, with attacks including shutting down airports with drones, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, and sabotaging rail lines used to transport military aid to Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said an explosion that damaged a railway line to Ukraine was "an act of sabotage," with Polish Internal Security Agency officials stating that Russian operatives are testing how much they can get away with, gauging Polish response capabilities, and assessing media reaction and investigative effectiveness.

Military experts characterize Russia's approach as operating in a "gray zone"—conducting attacks severe enough to cause disruption and fear but calibrated to remain below the threshold that would trigger Article 5 collective defense obligations under the NATO treaty. The attacks have become more frequent and more dangerous since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago, with targets expanding from purely military-related infrastructure to include civilian airports, power grids, and telecommunications networks across Poland, the Baltic states, and other NATO frontline countries.

The hybrid warfare campaign reflects Russia's broader strategy of weakening European resolve to support Ukraine while avoiding direct military confrontation with NATO that Moscow knows it cannot win. Polish officials have warned that Russia employs "disposable agents"—local criminals, ideological extremists, or financially desperate individuals recruited through online platforms—to carry out attacks, providing Moscow with plausible deniability while still achieving strategic objectives of creating chaos and fear across European societies.

### 8. Ukraine Detains Former Energy Minister at Border in $100 Million Corruption Probe
*Feb 15–16*

> Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau arrested former Energy Minister German Galushchenko at the border while attempting to flee the country on the Kyiv-Warsaw train, with investigators charging him with participating in a criminal organization and money laundering in a $100 million kickback scheme involving the state nuclear energy sector that has shaken President Zelenskyy's inner circle.

Ukrainian anti-corruption authorities detained German Galushchenko on February 15 as he attempted to cross the border into Poland, opening a criminal case the following day charging him with operating a criminal organization and laundering proceeds from systematic kickbacks in Ukraine's state nuclear energy company Energoatom. The investigation is part of ongoing Operation Midas, which is probing a $100 million corruption scheme involving Energoatom procurement contracts where members of the suspected criminal group demanded kickbacks of 10-15% of contract values from suppliers.

Prosecutors allege that Galushchenko and co-conspirators established control over Energoatom's procurement processes and systematically extorted payments from contractors, with suppliers who refused to pay having their payments blocked for completed work or being excluded from future bidding. Investigators discovered that more than $7 million had been transferred to foreign accounts naming Galushchenko's wife and four children as beneficiaries, suggesting elaborate schemes to hide corruption proceeds through family members and offshore financial structures.

The arrest represents one of the highest-profile corruption cases in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, with implications for international aid and Ukraine's EU membership aspirations. Western donors have repeatedly emphasized that continued military and financial support depends on Ukraine demonstrating concrete progress in fighting corruption, making high-profile prosecutions of government officials politically essential even as the country remains at war. The case has also created complications for Ukraine's energy security, as Galushchenko was deeply involved in negotiations with Western partners over nuclear fuel supplies and power grid reconstruction.

### 9. Philippines Signs Defense Cooperation Pacts with Italy and Estonia at Munich Conference
*Feb 14–16*

> The Philippines signed renewed defense cooperation agreements with Italy and Estonia during the Munich Security Conference, expanding military collaboration in areas including cybersecurity, capacity building, and potential defense technology co-production—reflecting Manila's strategy of diversifying security partnerships beyond traditional U.S. alliance amid rising tensions with China in the South China Sea.

Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro and Italian Minister of Defense Guido Crosetto signed a renewed bilateral defense cooperation agreement on February 14 in Munich, replacing an expired memorandum of understanding and expanding potential for defense co-production and technology cooperation. The Philippine Department of National Defense stated it looks forward to "sustained cooperation that strengthens maritime security, promotes global stability, and advances mutual interests" with Italy, one of Europe's leading defense manufacturers with particular expertise in naval vessels and radar systems.

The Philippines also finalized cooperation frameworks with Estonia, with Estonian officials expressing readiness for deeper engagement in cybersecurity, e-governance, and digital identification systems—areas where Estonia has developed world-leading expertise following years of Russian cyberattacks and hybrid warfare. The Estonia partnership is particularly significant given the Philippines' growing concerns about Chinese cyber espionage and the vulnerability of government networks to foreign intrusion, with Manila seeking to learn from Estonia's experience defending against sophisticated state-sponsored cyber operations.

The Munich agreements represent part of the Philippines' broader effort to build a diverse network of defense partnerships that reduce dependence on any single ally while strengthening overall military capabilities. Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Manila has been strengthening ties with traditional ally the United States while simultaneously expanding cooperation with Japan, Australia, South Korea, and now European partners—a "multi-alignment" strategy designed to maximize the Philippines' strategic options in an increasingly contested Indo-Pacific region where Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea poses growing challenges to Philippine sovereignty.

### 10. New START Nuclear Arms Treaty Expires, Ending Five Decades of U.S.-Russia Strategic Limits
*Feb 5*

> The New START treaty between the United States and Russia officially expired on February 5, 2026, leaving the world's two largest nuclear powers without any bilateral arms control agreements for the first time in more than 50 years and removing all binding limits on strategic nuclear arsenals as Russia declared treaty obligations no longer binding absent formal U.S. response.

The New START treaty—the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia—reached its expiration date on February 5, ending a framework that had capped each country at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers, and up to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. The treaty, which entered into force in 2011, could only be extended once and was always scheduled to expire on this date, meaning both countries have known for years that this moment was coming.

Russia had suspended its participation in New START on February 21, 2023, citing U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine, but did not formally withdraw from the treaty and initially indicated it would continue abiding by numerical limits. However, on February 4, 2026—one day before expiration—the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that in the absence of a formal U.S. response to Russian proposals, Moscow considered the treaty's obligations no longer binding, effectively ending even informal compliance with the agreement's limits.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a "grave moment" for global security, stating that "for the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals" of the U.S. and Russia, which together hold approximately 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. Arms control experts warn that the treaty's expiration removes verification mechanisms and transparency measures that had allowed both sides to monitor each other's nuclear forces, potentially leading to worst-case assumptions, miscalculations, and an unconstrained nuclear arms race that could draw in China and other nuclear-armed states.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Walmart Reports Q4 Earnings Beat But Issues Cautious 2026 Guidance Amid Tariff Concerns
*Feb 19*

> Walmart exceeded Wall Street's Q4 revenue expectations with nearly 6% sales growth driven by e-commerce gains of 27% and a 50% surge in store-fulfilled deliveries, but the stock initially dropped before recovering as the company's full-year 2026 earnings guidance of $2.75-$2.85 per share fell short of the $2.96 analyst consensus, reflecting concerns about tariff impacts and labor cost pressures.

Walmart reported Q4 fiscal 2026 results that beat revenue estimates with holiday-quarter sales rising nearly 6%, as gains in e-commerce, advertising, and third-party marketplace activity boosted business performance. The retailer's digital sales in the U.S. rose 27% compared to the year-ago period, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit e-commerce growth, with store-fulfilled deliveries surging approximately 50% and Walmart Connect advertising business growing roughly 41%.

Despite the strong Q4 performance, Walmart's guidance for the current fiscal year disappointed investors. The company projected full-year 2026 net sales to increase 3.5-4.5% with adjusted earnings per share of $2.75-$2.85, well below Wall Street's expectation of $2.96 per share. The cautious outlook reflects Walmart's concerns about the "fluid backdrop" created by ongoing tariff uncertainty, labor market pressures, and the potential for consumer spending to weaken following the federal government shutdown and declining consumer confidence.

Walmart shares initially fell on the guidance miss but recovered by the opening bell, with analysts not expressing significant concern about the company's outlook given macro headwinds. The company also announced a new $30 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing a $20 billion buyback program approved in 2022, signaling confidence in long-term cash generation even amid near-term uncertainty. Walmart's performance is being watched as the definitive barometer of U.S. consumer health, with its scale and income diversity providing unique insight into spending patterns across all economic segments.

### 2. Software Sector Plunges 20% in 2026 as AI Disruption Fears Trigger Historic Selloff
*Feb 19*

> The S&P 500 software and services industry group has plummeted roughly 20% in 2026, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF down 20% year-to-date, as investors flee established software companies amid fears that generative AI could automate workflows, compress pricing, and enable new competitors—wiping out approximately $1 trillion in market value from the sector.

The software sector has suffered a catastrophic decline in 2026, with the S&P 500 software and services industry group down approximately 20% as rising concerns that advances in AI could erode market share for established software companies trigger massive capital rotation out of the sector. The selloff reached a climax on February 3, 2026—now known across trading floors as "Black Tuesday for Software"—when the sector benchmark collapsed 13% in a single session following a series of disappointing guidance updates from major firms.

Individual software stocks have been devastated by the rotation. Salesforce has emerged as a primary casualty, with shares plunging 30% year-to-date as investors worry that generative AI could disrupt customer relationship management software. Adobe has seen shares drop 27% as generative video and design agents challenge its longtime dominance in the creative suite market. ServiceNow, traditionally viewed as a long-term wealth compounder, has fallen approximately 25-30% as markets question whether AI-powered workflow automation will cannibalize its core offerings or accelerate them.

The underlying fear driving the selloff is that software firms once valued for sticky subscriptions and dependable renewals now face existential threats from AI that could automate workflows, squeeze pricing power, and lower barriers to entry for new rivals. Software companies that spent years building network effects and switching costs are discovering that generative AI may allow competitors to rapidly replicate functionality, while customers increasingly question whether they need expensive enterprise software when AI agents can perform similar tasks. Bank of America analysts pushed back against the selloff as "irrational," arguing that the sector's long-term value creation remains intact, but the rebuttal has done little to stem the bleeding.

### 3. Gold Surges Past $5,000 Milestone as Iran War Risk and Safe-Haven Demand Converge
*Feb 19*

> Gold officially breached the $5,000 per ounce threshold during early morning trading on February 19, marking a historic milestone as U.S.-Iran military tensions, central bank diversification away from dollar reserves, and expectations of mid-2026 Federal Reserve rate cuts combined to drive the precious metal to levels Goldman Sachs projects could reach $5,400 by year-end.

Gold officially crossed the $5,000 per ounce mark during early morning trading on February 19, 2026, reaching as high as $5,009.69 per troy ounce by late afternoon as multiple supportive factors converged. The breakthrough came as Trump's 10-day ultimatum to Iran injected acute geopolitical risk premium into markets, with traders pricing in potential disruption to Middle East stability and oil flows. Central banks led by the People's Bank of China and Reserve Bank of India continued aggressive diversification campaigns away from U.S. Treasuries, collectively purchasing over 1,200 tonnes of gold for the third consecutive year.

Goldman Sachs raised its 2026 gold price target to $5,400 earlier this month, citing structural demand from central banks, geopolitical risk premia that are likely to persist regardless of specific conflict outcomes, and expectations that the Federal Reserve will resume its rate-cutting cycle in mid-2026, reducing real yields and increasing gold's relative attractiveness. Goldman's analysts specifically cited Iran escalation risk and U.S. tariff policy uncertainty as factors making safe-haven demand structural rather than transient.

The $5,000 threshold represents a powerful psychological level that could attract additional momentum-driven buying from commodity trading advisors and retail investors who use round-number breakouts as entry signals. However, some analysts caution that gold at current levels is pricing in significant geopolitical risk that could rapidly unwind if a U.S.-Iran deal is reached or military action is avoided. JPMorgan maintains a more cautious stance, noting that any diplomatic resolution to the Iran crisis could trigger sharp profit-taking from institutional investors who accumulated positions during January's historic rally to above $5,500.

### 4. Oil Prices Jump Above $66 as Strait of Hormuz Risks Overshadow Demand Concerns
*Feb 19*

> Oil prices surged more than 2.6% on Wednesday with WTI climbing to $66.43 and Brent reaching $71.66 as Trump's 10-day Iran ultimatum and reports of 90% probability of U.S. military strikes injected substantial risk premium into crude markets, despite International Energy Agency warnings of oversupply and weakening global demand.

Crude oil prices posted their biggest single-day gain since October on Wednesday, with WTI rising approximately 2.6% to $66.43 per barrel and Brent tracking proportionally higher to $71.66, as Axios reporting on near-certain U.S. military action against Iran within weeks triggered rapid repricing of geopolitical risk. The rally extended Thursday as Trump's explicit 10-day timeline for deciding on military strikes reinforced concerns about potential disruption to Iranian oil exports of approximately 1.5 million barrels per day and broader risks to Strait of Hormuz transit that handles roughly 20% of global oil supply.

The surge comes despite fundamentals that would normally pressure prices lower. The International Energy Agency lowered its global demand forecast earlier this month, indicating the market is well-supplied absent a conflict scenario. OPEC+ retains significant spare production capacity it could deploy if Iranian barrels were disrupted, and Venezuela's production ramp-up under new U.S. licenses is expected to add meaningful supply over the course of 2026. Technical analysts warned that WTI shows significant downside risk if prices fail to sustain above the $65 resistance level, with potential retreat to $58-60 if the Iran situation de-escalates.

Market participants are divided on sustainability of the risk premium. Swiss bank Lombard Odier estimates that any major disruption to the region could add 15-20% to crude oil prices as war premium, meaning oil could trade between $75-80 per barrel if the situation worsens. However, bears note that Venezuelan supply additions could roughly offset full loss of Iranian exports by year-end, providing a geopolitical hedge that markets have not fully priced. Iran conducted military exercises that partially closed the Strait of Hormuz for several hours this week, sending a clear message about its capability to disrupt global energy flows if attacked.

### 5. Treasury Yields Rise After Hawkish FOMC Minutes Show Fed Division on Rate Path
*Feb 18–19*

> The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4.1% for the first time in a week following release of Federal Reserve minutes showing policymakers divided over future rate moves, with some officials raising the possibility of additional hikes if inflation remains persistently high—pushing market expectations for first rate cut beyond mid-2026.

Treasury yields rose for a third consecutive session on Thursday, with the 10-year note climbing to 4.087% and the 2-year note reaching 3.47%, as markets digested Federal Reserve meeting minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC session that revealed deeper divisions among policymakers than previously understood. While the decision to hold rates steady at 3.5-3.75% was broadly supported, the minutes showed some officials advocating for "more two-sided language" on future rate moves, explicitly raising the possibility of rate hikes—not just cuts—if economic conditions warrant.

The hawkish tone in the minutes significantly reduced expectations for near-term monetary easing. CME FedWatch probabilities for a March 2026 rate cut fell to below 5%, with the first fully-priced cut now expected no earlier than June 2026, and even that remains conditional on economic data showing meaningful disinflation. Several policymakers emphasized that sticky inflation readings and a still-solid labor market make any near-term cut premature, while others noted that lagged effects of previous tightening and uncertain tariff environment justify keeping cuts on the table.

Friday's simultaneous release of Q4 2025 GDP, December PCE inflation data, and personal income/spending figures will be critical for determining the rate path. Core PCE is expected at 2.8% year-over-year, still well above the Fed's 2% target, while GDP is forecast at 2.8-3.0% annualized growth—suggesting the economy remains too strong and inflation too high to justify monetary easing. Wall Street analysts have described Friday's data dump as potentially "dictating the 2026 interest rate path," with a strong GDP reading combined with sticky inflation likely to push rate cut expectations into late 2026 or even 2027.

### 6. Stock Market Sector Rotation Accelerates as Energy, Materials Outperform Tech by 20+ Points
*Feb 19*

> The "Great Sector Rotation of 2026" intensified as Energy surged 21% year-to-date, Materials gained 17%, and Industrials rose 12%, vastly outperforming the flat broader market and down-20% software sector—driven by a convergence of cooling enthusiasm for asset-light tech models and surge in domestic industrial activity following Trump tariff policies.

The stock market's historic sector rotation away from technology and toward "Old Economy" cyclicals accelerated in February, with Energy, Materials, and Industrials vastly outperforming growth-oriented tech sectors. Energy has posted a staggering 21% gain year-to-date, led by Chevron and SLB, while Materials surged 17% and Industrials climbed 12%. Meanwhile, Consumer Staples rose 15% as defensive positioning intensified. These gains stand in stark contrast to software down 20% and the broader market effectively flat, representing one of the sharpest sector performance divergences in modern market history.

The rotation reflects a fundamental reassessment of value in the post-AI-hype environment. Capital is fleeing high-valuation tech companies that face AI disruption risks and flowing toward physical assets, commodities, and industrial producers that benefit from Trump administration tariff policies favoring domestic manufacturing. The "Liberation Day" tariffs that took effect in April 2025 have created tailwinds for domestic producers in Basic Materials and Industrial sectors, while making it economically viable to reshore manufacturing that had previously moved offshore.

Market strategists characterize 2026 as the year when investors shifted focus from "the models" (AI software) to "the power, the metal, and the machinery" (physical infrastructure). Real assets are leading 2026 performance, with gold, metals, and mining companies posting outstanding returns. The equal-weight S&P 500 has been hitting record highs even as the market-cap-weighted index remains flat, demonstrating that breadth has dramatically improved despite mega-cap tech weakness. Some analysts warn this rotation could persist for years if AI continues to threaten software incumbents while infrastructure investment accelerates globally.

### 7. Major Economic Data Release Friday: GDP and PCE to "Dictate 2026 Rate Path"
*Feb 19–20*

> Wall Street is bracing for Friday's simultaneous release of Q4 2025 GDP advance estimate (consensus 2.8%), December PCE inflation (core expected 2.8% year-over-year), and personal income/spending data in what analysts call the most consequential economic release of the first quarter, with results likely determining whether Fed rate cuts happen in mid-2026 or are pushed to year-end.

The economic calendar for Friday, February 20 features three critical data releases scheduled simultaneously: the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish the advance estimate of Q4 2025 GDP growth, December PCE inflation reading (the Fed's preferred inflation gauge), and December personal income/spending data. The consolidated data dump represents what MarketMinute analysts described as an "inflection point" for first-half 2026 monetary policy, with potential to either validate Fed rate cut expectations for mid-year or push them significantly further out.

Consensus estimates call for Q4 GDP growth of 2.8% annualized, a notable cooling from Q3's 4.4% but still comfortably above the 1.8-2.0% "neutral" rate economists associate with non-inflationary growth. Core PCE is expected at 0.4% month-over-month, which if realized would push year-over-year core PCE to approximately 3.0%—a sharp acceleration from late 2025's 0.2% monthly readings and well above the Fed's 2% target. The combination of solid growth and reaccelerating inflation would validate the FOMC's hawkish pause and likely eliminate any possibility of rate cuts before summer.

The stakes are particularly high given the federal government shutdown that disrupted December economic activity and DOGE-driven spending cuts expected to register in GDP data. A reading below 1.5% combined with PCE above 2.8% would present a stagflation scenario—slowing growth with sticky inflation—that would leave the Fed paralyzed between competing mandates. Conversely, if growth proves stronger than expected while inflation moderates, markets could interpret that as a "Goldilocks" outcome justifying gradual rate cuts starting mid-year. Friday afternoon trading is expected to be highly volatile as algorithms and human traders rapidly adjust positioning based on the data.

### 8. Canadian Prime Minister Carney Spearheads EU-CPTPP Trade Alliance to Counter Trump Tariffs
*Feb 17*

> Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is leading discussions to link the European Union and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in what could become one of the most significant economic alliances in decades, connecting nearly 40 countries and roughly 1.5 billion people across Europe and the Indo-Pacific in response to Trump's escalating tariff threats.

Prime Minister Mark Carney has emerged as the leading advocate for creating a unified trade framework between the European Union and CPTPP member nations, first promoting the concept during his Davos address where he urged middle powers to resist what he described as coercive trade tactics and growing economic fragmentation. The proposed initiative would bring together EU members and CPTPP countries including Canada, Japan, Singapore, Mexico, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Australia in a streamlined supply chain framework that aligns rules of origin and reduces exposure to U.S. tariffs.

The discussions focus on allowing companies to move goods more efficiently between Europe and Indo-Pacific by simplifying cross-border manufacturing rules, potentially creating a combined economic bloc that would represent roughly 30% of global GDP. Canadian officials have confirmed preliminary talks are underway, with Ottawa actively promoting dialogue between European and Asian partners. Carney's Davos speech—in which he warned that "the rules-based international order was partially false"—was widely interpreted as a direct rebuke to Trump's transactional approach to trade relations.

The initiative faces significant implementation challenges, including divergent regulatory standards between EU and CPTPP members, political sensitivities about sovereignty and labor standards, and the question of whether such an alliance would provoke even harsher U.S. trade retaliation. However, the fact that serious discussions are occurring reflects the degree to which Trump's tariff escalation—including the recent 10% levy on eight European countries over Greenland—has pushed traditional U.S. allies toward exploring alternatives to an American-led trade order. The Peterson Institute for International Economics assessed that "smaller economies really can create a new world trade order" if political will exists.

### 9. Nvidia Earnings on February 25 Draw Intense Scrutiny as AI Spending Sustainability Questioned
*Feb 17–19*

> Nvidia is scheduled to report Q4 fiscal 2026 results on February 25 after market close, with analysts projecting EPS of $1.49 and the semiconductor giant's guidance expected to provide the definitive signal on whether AI infrastructure spending remains robust or is beginning to slow—a reading that could determine the trajectory of tech stocks through year-end.

Nvidia's Q4 fiscal 2026 earnings release scheduled for Wednesday, February 25 at 2 p.m. PT has emerged as the most anticipated corporate event of the quarter, with the company's results and guidance expected to either validate or refute growing concerns about sustainability of AI infrastructure spending. The Motley Fool noted that "history tells us about Nvidia stock's post-earnings-release moves," with the stock historically exhibiting high volatility following quarterly reports as investors parse both absolute results and forward-looking commentary.

The backdrop for Nvidia's report is complex. On one hand, the company announced a massive multi-year deal with Meta this week to supply millions of AI chips including GB300 systems and Grace CPUs, suggesting enterprise demand remains extremely strong. Planned capital expenditures toward AI for 2026 approach $700 billion across the industry, providing a vast addressable market for Nvidia's accelerators. On the other hand, the software sector's 20% collapse reflects investor fears that AI may not generate returns justifying such massive infrastructure investments, raising questions about whether customers will sustain current spending levels through 2026 and beyond.

Analysts will be focused not just on Q4 results but critically on Nvidia's guidance for fiscal Q1 and full-year 2026, as well as any commentary about order patterns, customer mix, and competitive dynamics with AMD and emerging AI chip startups. Any suggestion that hyperscaler spending is plateauing or that enterprise AI adoption is slower than expected could trigger sharp selloffs across the semiconductor and cloud infrastructure sectors. Conversely, strong guidance and confident commentary could provide the catalyst needed to reverse recent tech weakness and restore investor confidence in AI's profit potential.

### 10. Home Depot Earnings February 24 to Test Housing Market Resilience Amid 7%+ Mortgage Rates
*Feb 19*

> Home Depot is scheduled to report Q4 fiscal 2026 earnings on Tuesday, February 24 at 9 a.m. ET, providing critical insight into housing market health following January's 8.4% existing home sales decline—the steepest monthly drop in over a year—as mortgage rates holding above 7% create severe affordability pressures for consumers.

Home Depot's Q4 fiscal 2026 earnings conference call scheduled for February 24 will offer the most important read on housing market conditions and home improvement spending trends, coming against a backdrop of severe housing market stress. The January existing home sales report showed an 8.4% monthly decline, the largest drop in over a year, driven by mortgage rates stubbornly holding above 7% and consumer confidence plunging to decade lows following the federal government shutdown and ongoing tariff uncertainty.

The home improvement retail sector faces a complex demand environment. On one hand, high mortgage rates create a "lock-in effect" where homeowners with sub-4% mortgages from 2020-21 are unwilling to sell and take on new debt at 7%+, leading them to invest in renovating existing homes rather than moving. This dynamic theoretically supports Home Depot's remodeling and renovation categories. On the other hand, weakening consumer confidence and concerns about job security could cause homeowners to defer major discretionary home improvement projects, particularly large-ticket items like kitchen and bathroom renovations that drive Home Depot's highest-margin sales.

Analysts will scrutinize commentary on professional contractor activity versus DIY consumer spending, geographic performance trends, and any impact from tariffs on imported goods like power tools and building materials. Home Depot's guidance for fiscal 2026 will be particularly important given that housing-related sectors account for significant portions of U.S. GDP and employment. The company's performance often serves as a leading indicator for construction activity, residential investment, and overall consumer willingness to make long-term financial commitments.
