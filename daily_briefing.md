### 1. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Assassinated in Libya, Sparking International Probe
*Feb 3*

> Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and a leading presidential candidate, was assassinated by four masked gunmen at his home in Zintan, Libya, ending hopes for political reconciliation in the fractured North African nation.

Gaddafi's political team released a statement describing the February 3 attack as a "cowardly and treacherous assassination" in which four masked gunmen raided Gaddafi's home after disabling security cameras. Forensic experts dispatched to Zintan confirmed that "the victim died from wounds by gunfire," with Gaddafi, 53, dying at the scene. The public prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the killing, which occurred in the western Libyan city that had served as Gaddafi's base since his release from detention.

Saif al-Islam was considered to be his father's number two from 2000 until 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was killed by Libyan opposition forces during the NATO-backed uprising. The International Criminal Court had wanted him since 2011 for crimes against humanity, and in 2015, a court in Tripoli sentenced him to death by firing squad in absentia for war crimes. Despite these legal challenges, Gaddafi had emerged as the only figure who could coalesce the "Green" constituency loyal to his father's legacy, and political opponents worried that he might take votes not only from supporters of the former regime but also from those fed up with Libya's current state of dysfunction.

Thousands of people attended Gaddafi's funeral on Friday in the town of Bani Walid, some 175 kilometres south of Tripoli. Some reports allege foreign involvement, with France and the United Kingdom reportedly involved in the assassination, though these claims remain unverified allegations. The killing marks the end of a political era in Libya and removes one of the few figures with sufficient legitimacy to potentially unify the country's competing factions, leaving Libya's path to stability even more uncertain.

### 2. US Conducts Christmas Day Airstrikes in Nigeria Targeting ISIS, Claims Christian Protection
*Dec 25-Feb 6*

> President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on ISIS targets in Sokoto state, northwest Nigeria, on Christmas Day, framing the operation as defending Christians from genocide—a characterization that has sparked intense debate over the accuracy of the administration's rationale.

The United States conducted airstrikes on ISIS targets in Sokoto state in northwest Nigeria on December 25, 2025, with President Trump stating the strikes were intended to "decimate the ISIS terrorists who have been slaughtering Christians in that country by the thousands." At the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., on February 6, 2026, Trump confirmed that the United States collaborated closely with the Nigerian government to conduct these airstrikes, revealing he specifically ordered the strikes to occur on Christmas Day, saying "I said no, do it on Christmas. So they understand it."

However, the characterization of the violence as specifically targeting Christians has been disputed by experts and conflict monitors. While there are attacks by the Islamic State against Christians, they also attack Muslims who don't believe in their extremist worldview. Data from conflict monitor ACLED show a rise in Christian fatalities, mostly in Central Nigeria, but the vast majority of incidents were over land disputes rather than targeting based on religion. From a legal definition standpoint, claims of genocide don't hold up according to international law experts.

Isolated strikes like these are unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the region, with losses representing only a small fraction of Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Lakurawa resources. There are concerns about civilian casualties in Sokoto, the use of poor intelligence, and the fact that none of the locations targeted were affected by Islamic State-related activity according to some analysts. Nigerian Catholic Church leaders gave mixed reactions to the US airstrikes, with some welcoming the support while others expressed concerns about sovereignty and the effectiveness of military approaches to addressing complex security challenges in Nigeria's northwest.

### 3. New START Treaty Expires, Ending Five Decades of US-Russia Nuclear Arms Control
*Feb 5*

> The New START treaty expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time since the early 1970s that no legally binding limits exist on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces, raising fears of an unchecked nuclear arms race.

The New START treaty, which capped the US and Russia each at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers, and up to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers, expired after exhausting its five-year extension negotiated by the Biden administration in 2021. The treaty also established detailed transparency and verification mechanisms, including data exchanges, notifications, and on-site inspections that provided critical insight into each nation's nuclear capabilities.

Russia suspended the treaty in early 2023 over Washington's support for Ukraine, though Moscow said it would still observe agreed upon restrictions. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to voluntarily continue to abide by the treaty's limits for another year. However, President Donald Trump referred to the treaty as a "badly negotiated deal" and said that rather than extend it, "we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty."

Trump has suggested that if New START expires, a "better" agreement could be negotiated and said that China should be included. However, Beijing has consistently argued that it will not join formal arms control negotiations while its arsenal remains far smaller than those of the US and Russia. The expiration signals a move away from nuclear restraint, making the world a more dangerous place. The U.S. and Russia possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons, or more than 10,500 warheads combined, and without treaty limits, both nations could potentially expand their arsenals unchecked, raising the specter of a new nuclear arms race reminiscent of the Cold War era.

### 4. Trump Administration Foreign Aid Cuts Linked to Over 350,000 Deaths
*Jan-Feb 2026*

> More than 350,000 deaths, including over 200,000 children, have been attributed to the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts following the January 2025 executive order that suspended USAID funding worldwide, according to multiple independent assessments.

On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14169 suspending foreign aid pending a review. Following Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Peter Marocco issued a stop work order on all 6,200 grants and contracts worldwide, effectively freezing lifesaving health and food aid programs across the developing world. The administration permanently cancelled 83 percent of USAID's global contracts just weeks after the executive order, enacting what amounts to an 85 percent cut to U.S. aid programs by March.

Multiple sources report significant death tolls associated with the aid cuts. Senator Brian Schatz noted that over 360,000 people had already died as a result of not having food and medication in the wake of the funding cuts. Other estimates suggest that some 600,000 people have died in the past year after being cut off of lifesaving health and food aid provided by USAID—about two thirds of them children. The cuts have affected HIV/AIDS treatment programs, maternal and child health initiatives, nutrition programs for malnourished children, and clean water projects across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

UN experts have stated that the US Government is "fuelling global humanitarian catastrophe" through these cuts. As of February 2026, Congress has allocated $50 billion for foreign aid in 2026—a 16% cut from 2025—representing a partial restoration but still far below previous funding levels. Congressional Democrats have launched investigations into aid-related deaths, with Representatives Brad Sherman and Gregory Meeks leading all Foreign Affairs Committee Democrats in demanding accountability for the humanitarian consequences of the funding suspension. The aid cuts represent one of the most dramatic shifts in US foreign policy in decades, with consequences that will likely be felt for years across developing nations that had relied on American assistance.

### 5. Kazakhstan Prosecutes 19 Activists Under Chinese Pressure Over Xinjiang Protests
*Jan-Feb 2026*

> China appears to have pressured Kazakhstan to prosecute 19 activists who protested Beijing's mass detention of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, with Kazakh authorities using a Chinese diplomatic note as key evidence to charge the activists with "inciting ethnic discord."

On January 23, 2026, the trial of the 19 defenders began in the city of Taldykorgan, reportedly held behind closed doors. The defenders are accused of "inciting ethnic or national discord" under Article 174(2) of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan, which carries a sentence of up to ten years' imprisonment. The case centers on a November 13 demonstration in the village of Qalzhat in eastern Kazakhstan, just a few kilometers from the Chinese border, where the group gathered to protest China's treatment of ethnic Kazakhs and Uyghurs in Xinjiang and to demand the release of Alimnur Turghanbai, a naturalized Kazakh citizen originally from Xinjiang who has been detained in China since July.

The charges stem from the demonstration where activists burned three Chinese flags and a portrait of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The protest "negatively impacted the two nations' friendship," according to a Kazakh indictment, with "The Chinese side has expressed serious concerns regarding the incident." China's Consulate General expressed hope that the action would be properly investigated, and Chinese diplomatic pressure appears to have been instrumental in Kazakhstan's decision to prosecute the activists. Among those detained is Nazigul Maksutkhan, who was seven months pregnant at the time of her arrest.

Rights groups call the case politically motivated and say it shows Kazakhstan's growing crackdown on dissent and Beijing's influence in the country. Human Rights Watch has called for charges to be dropped, stating that the prosecution represents a troubling precedent of China's cross-border influence in suppressing criticism of its Xinjiang policies. The case highlights the difficult balancing act Kazakhstan faces between maintaining sovereignty and managing its relationship with powerful neighbor China, which has significant economic leverage over the Central Asian nation.

### 6. Venezuela's Maduro Captured by US Forces in Controversial January Operation
*Jan 3-Feb 2026*

> President Donald J. Trump announced the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro following a January 3 joint U.S. military extraction operation in Venezuela's capital of Caracas, sparking international condemnation and raising questions about the legality of the intervention under international law.

The capture was undertaken by the US Army's Delta Force, with on-the-ground intelligence provided by the CIA. According to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Maduro was arrested and would face criminal charges in the US related to drug-related offenses. Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were captured at Fort Tiuna, and Trump posted a photograph on his Truth Social account of Maduro on board USS Iwo Jima, showing him blindfolded, with soundproof headphones and a gray Nike sweatsuit, holding a plastic water bottle.

The Trump administration has claimed that the regime change operation in Venezuela was not an act of war but rather a law enforcement operation carried out by U.S. armed forces, pointing to the criminal indictment for President Maduro and his wife for drug-related offenses. However, it is difficult to conceive of possible legal justifications for transporting Maduro to the US, or for the attacks, according to international law experts at Chatham House. There is no UN Security Council mandate that might authorize force, and this was clearly not an instance of a US act of self-defence triggered by a prior or ongoing armed attack by Venezuela.

The attack was condemned by other countries, including Brazil, Chile, China, France, Iran, Mexico, North Korea, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, and Spain. UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that US actions had "worrying implications for the region," "constitute[d] a dangerous precedent," and worried "that the rules of international law have not been respected." Representatives of Russia and China called for the immediate release of President Maduro, while the US representative rejected characterisations of US actions as military aggression, describing the operation as a targeted law enforcement measure to arrest an indicted fugitive. Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodríguez has moved to privatize the country's oil industry, potentially opening opportunities for US companies but also creating new regional dynamics.

### 7. Europe Explores Weaponization of Finance to Counter Trump Greenland Threats
*Feb 3-6*

> Following Trump's demand to "own" Greenland, European financial experts have openly discussed using Europe's $6 trillion holdings of US debt as strategic leverage, raising the possibility of a financial confrontation between traditional allies.

During the Greenland crisis before Davos, Europeans explored tools to counter the Trump administration, with Deutsche Bank's George Saravelos warning that "Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of [U.S.] treasuries," suggesting possible "weaponization of capital." An article published February 3, 2026, discusses how Europe could use finance as leverage, recommending targeted export tariffs, taxes on royalties, and the elimination of US Treasuries' risk-free status as potential tools for Europe.

America's largest vulnerability is its dependence on foreign investors to finance its massive deficit, projected at about 6% of GDP, with another $1.8 trillion to be added to the existing $38 trillion debt. European investors hold about $6 trillion of US debt—approximately $3 trillion in US Treasuries and another $3 trillion in Treasury-backed US housing-agency debt. When a Deutsche Bank analyst suggested European investors could sell off their US bonds and equities in response to Trump's Greenland threats, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the risk while warning Europe against such sales.

While Trump has since backed down on the Greenland threats, the episode revealed how far European thinking has evolved in contemplating financial retaliation against the United States. The discussion of weaponizing European holdings of US debt represents a fundamental shift in transatlantic relations, where economic interdependence that once guaranteed cooperation is now being considered as a source of leverage in disputes. The episode underscores the fragility of the post-World War II financial architecture when political tensions between allies reach critical levels, and how quickly the "special relationship" can transform into financial brinkmanship.

### 8. Iran Protests Death Toll Passes 6,900 as Revolutionary Guard Intensifies Crackdown
*Dec 2025-Feb 2026*

> Protests that began in Iran on December 28, 2025, have resulted in over 6,900 confirmed deaths according to human rights monitors, making them among the largest massacres in modern Iranian history as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps intensifies its crackdown on dissent.

The protests initially sparked by economic grievances subsequently spread to become among the largest in recent years, quickly evolving into the most serious challenge to the Islamic Republic since the Woman, Life, Freedom movement in 2022–23. As of February 5, 2026, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) had documented a total of 18,571 cases, including 6,941 confirmed deaths, of whom at least 6,495 were protesters, with 11,630 additional cases under review. As of January 25, 2026, total death toll estimates ranged from 3,117 (per Iranian government) to upwards of 36,500 including 209 government-affiliated military and non-military personnel.

Anti-riot police and members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force were deployed during the crackdown. The 2026 Fardis massacre was committed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on January 8, 2026 in Fardis, Alborz province, Iran. Time reported that a specific list included 30,304 protest-related deaths registered in civilian hospitals for January 8 and 9 alone, suggesting the scale of violence reached extraordinary levels during the height of the crackdown.

The European Union and Ukraine designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization in response to the crackdown on protesters. US President Donald Trump encouraged protesters and has threatened several times to strike Iran if they continue killing protesters, with an Iranian official telling the Reuters news agency that about 2,000 people have been killed in the protests, including security personnel. Multiple countries imposed sanctions in response to the violence. The scale of the crackdown and the death toll represent one of the most severe acts of state repression in the 21st century, with implications for Iran's domestic stability and its international standing.

### 9. Gaza Violence Continues Despite Ceasefire, 23 Killed in Deadliest Day Since October
*Feb 4*

> Israeli air strikes killed 24 people in Gaza on February 4, marking one of the deadliest days since the ceasefire began in October 2025, as violence continues despite the ongoing US-brokered truce entering its second phase.

Gazan health officials reported the deadly toll from a series of Israeli strikes on Wednesday, February 4. The Gazan health ministry said 21 people were killed, including three children, in the series of strikes, with at least 38 others wounded. The territory's civil defence agency reported two more people were killed in a strike on a tent and another person killed in a strike west of Gaza City. The Israeli military said it launched strikes after "terrorists opened fire on troops" Wednesday, seriously wounding an officer, framing the attacks as defensive responses to ongoing security threats.

Despite an ongoing US-brokered truce entering its second phase, violence has continued in Gaza, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of breaching the agreement. Gaza's health ministry reports at least 556 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, raising questions about the effectiveness of the truce and the prospects for a lasting peace. The attacks occurred around the same time Israel partly reopened the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing limited humanitarian access and some civilian movement.

The continued violence underscores the fragility of the ceasefire arrangement and the challenges in translating a cessation of major hostilities into a durable peace. Palestinian officials have called for international pressure on Israel to fully respect the ceasefire terms, while Israeli officials cite security concerns and ongoing militant activity as justification for continued military operations. The situation remains volatile, with the potential for the limited violence to escalate back into the large-scale conflict that characterized much of 2024 and early 2025.

### 10. T20 Cricket World Cup Opens with Political Controversy as Pakistan Boycotts India Match
*Feb 1-7*

> The 2026 ICC T20 World Cup began on February 7 amid political turmoil, with Pakistan announcing it would boycott its scheduled Group A match against India on February 15, and Bangladesh being replaced by Scotland following security concerns.

Bangladesh was officially replaced by Scotland on January 24, as Scotland was the next highest ranked team in ICC T20 rankings who had not qualified for the tournament. This came after the Bangladesh Cricket Board requested their matches be moved from India citing security reasons, following an incident where Mustafizur Rahman was released by the Kolkata Knight Riders from the 2026 IPL squad. The ICC's refusal to relocate Bangladesh's matches from India set the stage for further political complications.

On February 1, 2026, the Government of Pakistan announced that the Pakistan team would boycott its scheduled Group A match against India on February 15. This was reportedly taken in protest against the ICC's refusal to relocate Bangladesh's matches out of India. The tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up, with Pakistan refusing to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture. Pakistan are in Group A along with India, Namibia, the Netherlands and the United States, playing all their matches in Sri Lanka.

The 2026 ICC T20 World Cup is the tenth edition, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8, 2026. The tournament begins with India facing the United States at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai at 7pm local time (13:30 GMT), with holders and favorites India among the main attractions. However, the political controversies threaten to overshadow the sporting competition, highlighting how geopolitical tensions between South Asian neighbors continue to intrude on international sporting events, creating complications for organizers and disappointing fans hoping for marquee matchups.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Hedge Funds Rake in $24 Billion Shorting Software Stocks as Sector Loses $1 Trillion
*Feb 4*

> Short-sellers made a $24 billion windfall so far in software stocks this year as the overall market value in the industry decreased by $1 trillion, with hedge funds increasing their bets against companies vulnerable to AI disruption.

Short-sellers have made a $24 billion windfall so far in software stocks this year as the overall market value in the industry decreased by $1 trillion, according to data from S3 Partners. Hedge funds are increasing their short bets against software stocks, contributing to the brutal sell-off in the space so far this year. "Hedge funds are all net short software right now," said Gil Luria, analyst at DA Davidson, highlighting the widespread pessimism about the sector's prospects in the face of advancing artificial intelligence capabilities.

The hedge fund sources wouldn't comment on specific names where big short bets are being increased, but said the focus appears to be on companies that provide basic automation services for clients that can be easily replicated by new AI tools. Fears that advanced agentic AI tools from startups like Anthropic are beginning to cannibalize the revenue streams of established enterprise giants led to a localized $1 trillion loss in that sector alone before bleeding into the broader index. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) has fallen more than 21% year-to-date, including an 8% drop this week alone, and is now roughly 30% below its September 2025 peak.

Stocks such as TeraWulf and Asana in the ETF have the biggest total short bets against them currently, according to data from S3 Partners. For TeraWulf, more than 35% of its shares currently available for trading are being sold short, while that figure is 25% for Asana. Dropbox and Cipher Mining have 19% and 17% of their trading float sold short respectively. Among the worst performers in the IGV ETF so far this year are Intuit, a maker of tax preparation software, and DocuSign, which handles PDFs and other documents, with both down more than 30% as investors question whether AI agents will replace their core offerings.

### 2. Texas Instruments Acquires Silicon Labs for $7.5 Billion to Expand Wireless Footprint
*Feb 4*

> Texas Instruments announced it would acquire Silicon Labs for $231.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $7.5 billion, marking its biggest acquisition since the $6.5 billion deal for National Semiconductor in 2011.

Texas Instruments announced on February 4, 2026, that it would acquire Silicon Labs for $231.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $7.5 billion. The acquisition price represents a premium of about 69% to Silicon Labs' last unaffected closing price on Tuesday, when deal talks were first reported. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2027, pending regulatory approvals. Texas Instruments is planning to finance the acquisition through cash on hand and debt.

Texas Instruments agreed to buy Silicon Laboratories to expand its footprint in wireless connectivity chips used for industrial and consumer applications. For Texas Instruments, whose core strength lies in analog chips that manage signals and power in electronic equipment, the acquisition marks its biggest since the $6.5 billion deal for National Semiconductor in 2011. The deal gives Texas Instruments access to Silicon Labs' portfolio of wireless connectivity products including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and proprietary protocols used in Internet of Things devices, smart home products, and industrial automation.

The deal is likely to generate about $450 million in annual manufacturing and operational savings within three years of closing, according to company statements. Silicon Labs brings approximately $1.4 billion in annual revenue and strong margins in the wireless connectivity space, complementing Texas Instruments' existing analog and embedded processing portfolio. The acquisition comes as demand for connectivity chips accelerates across industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics applications, with the Internet of Things market projected to continue rapid growth through the end of the decade.

### 3. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss Ousted After Disappointing Forecast and US Wealth Outflows
*Feb 2026*

> Alex Chriss is stepping down with immediate effect as PayPal CEO following disappointing fourth-quarter results announced in early February 2026, with HP CEO Enrique Lores set to take over on March 1 as the payments giant struggles with competitive pressures.

Alex Chriss is stepping down with immediate effect following disappointing fourth-quarter results announced in early February 2026. Chriss had only joined the digital payments company in September 2023 as president and CEO, making his tenure less than 2.5 years. On March 1, HP CEO Enrique Lores will take over as PayPal's CEO from Alex Chriss, with CFO Jamie Miller serving as interim CEO until then. The abrupt leadership change reflects the board's dissatisfaction with the company's trajectory under Chriss's leadership.

The departure followed several financial disappointments. The payments giant reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 1.23 dollar per share, missing analysts' expectations of 1.29 dollar. Revenue also fell short, coming in at 8.68 billion dollar—around 90 million dollar below the average analyst estimate. In "Branded Checkout"—the company's most profitable product line built around the classic PayPal button—currency-adjusted volume increased by just 1 percent, sharply down from the 8 percent growth seen in previous quarters, signaling competitive pressure from newer payment platforms.

The company's 2026 forecast predicted a low-single-digit drop or a slight rise in adjusted earnings per share, and for the first quarter, PayPal expects a "mid-single-digit" decline in earnings—whereas analysts had been forecasting growth. The disappointing guidance combined with slowing growth in the core business prompted the board to make the leadership change. PayPal faces intense competition from Apple Pay, digital wallets, and emerging fintech players, with the company struggling to maintain its market position as digital payments continue to fragment across multiple platforms.

### 4. Bank of America Downgrades Qualcomm as Memory Crunch Throttles Handset Outlook
*Feb 4-5*

> Bank of America analyst Tal Liani downgraded Qualcomm stock to neutral from buy and lowered the price target to $155 from $215, citing a weaker handset market and share losses as a global memory crunch affects smartphone production.

Bank of America analyst Tal Liani downgraded Qualcomm stock to neutral from buy rating and lowered the price target to $155 from $215, following Qualcomm's earnings report on February 4, 2026. The downgrade was primarily driven by weakness in the handset market, which makes up 74% of total Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) revenue. The handset market is expected to see an approximately 15% decline in unit volume this year compared to approximately 2% prior expectations, related to memory pricing volatility.

Rising memory prices are pressuring smartphone makers' inventory plans, particularly in China, with constraints expected to persist for several years. Liani said rising memory prices are affecting the inventory plans of smartphone OEMs, primarily in China, and constraints are expected to persist until 2028, according to Intel. The memory supply shortage has created a cascading effect through the smartphone supply chain, with manufacturers delaying orders for application processors and other components when they cannot secure sufficient memory chips to complete devices.

Beyond memory constraints, the company has previously noted it is losing 25% share at Samsung, share at Apple is expected to decline in September, and China is likely to see seasonal slowdown after last quarter's handset launch and holiday-driven strength. Qualcomm shares dropped 10.5% in a single session as investors processed a projected 13% year-over-year decline in handset chip revenue. Multiple other financial institutions also cut their price targets and ratings following the weak guidance, with concerns that the headwinds could persist through much of 2026 before stabilizing.

### 5. Dow Crosses 50,000 Milestone as Markets Stage Historic Friday Rally
*Feb 6*

> The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,206 points to close above 50,000 for the first time in history, with the S&P 500 rallying 2% and the Nasdaq advancing 2.2% as chip stocks led a dramatic recovery from the week's tech rout.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 50,000 for the first time on February 6, 2026, marking a historic milestone for the 30-stock blue-chip index. The Dow finished at a record 50,115.67 on Friday, rising more than 1,200 points for the day in its biggest single-day point gain of 2026. The S&P 500 rallied 2% for its best day since May, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,206 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq composite leaped 2.2%. Friday's rebound followed several days of heavy selling in the tech sector.

Chip companies helped drive the widespread rally, with Nvidia jumping 7.8% to trim its loss for the week, which came into the day at just over 10%. The move caps a strong rally, with the Dow up 4.25% year-to-date and 11.99% over the past year. Financials dominate the index at 27.8% of holdings, with Goldman Sachs alone representing 11.97% of the Dow's weight. The sector's strength reflects confidence in banking and payment processors as the Federal Reserve maintains a 3.75% fed funds rate following a 75 basis point cut over the past year.

The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for February clocked in at 57.3, well above economists' expectations of 54.3, marking the highest reading since August. With unemployment holding steady at 4.4%, the economic backdrop supports continued gains if corporate earnings meet expectations in coming quarters. The milestone represents a psychological victory for bulls who have argued that fears about AI spending and economic slowdown have been overblown, though skeptics note that the Dow's price-weighted methodology gives outsized influence to a handful of high-priced stocks.

### 6. Amazon Plunges 10% on $200 Billion AI Spending Shocker Despite Strong AWS Growth
*Feb 5-6*

> Amazon announced massive capital expenditures of around $200 billion for 2026 in the AI field, triggering a 10% stock decline as investors pivoted their focus from short-term profitability to the staggering spending plan that far exceeded Wall Street expectations.

Amazon announced massive capital expenditures of around $200 billion for 2026 in the AI field, which triggered a significant stock decline. Amazon shares suffered their steepest one-day decline in nearly two years on Friday, February 6, 2026, with the stock tumbling 10% as investors pivoted their focus from short-term profitability to the staggering spending plan. Amazon projected a surge of more than 50% in capital expenditures this year, sending its shares down 11.5% in after-hours trading Thursday. By Friday's close, Amazon closed at $210.32, down 5.55%, after management outlined plans for roughly $200 billion in 2026 capital expenditures focused on AI and cloud infrastructure.

The market reaction highlights a growing "sticker shock" among shareholders who had anticipated a more moderate $150 billion capex figure. Shares dropped the most in six months after the company announced plans to spend $200 billion this year on data centers, chips and other equipment, worrying investors that its colossal bet on artificial intelligence may not pay off in the long run. The massive spending plan came despite positive business results, as AWS revenue came in at $35.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year, marking a re-acceleration to the fastest growth rate since 2022.

CEO Andy Jassy defended the investments as necessary to meet surging demand for AI compute capacity, arguing that companies cannot afford to fall behind in the AI infrastructure race. However, the stock's decline reflected skepticism about near-term margin pressures and uncertainty about when the massive investments will translate into proportionate revenue and profit growth. The spending plan joins similar announcements from Alphabet ($185 billion) and Microsoft ($80 billion), raising questions about whether big tech companies are engaged in an unsustainable capital spending arms race or making prescient investments in the next computing platform.

### 7. Nvidia CEO Huang Says AI Demand "Sky High" as Stock Surges 8% Following CNBC Interview
*Feb 6*

> Jensen Huang appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box to discuss the state of AI, declaring that demand for AI is "just incredibly high" and describing the current moment as a definitive "inflection point," propelling Nvidia shares up more than 8% on Friday.

Jensen Huang appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box in early February 2026 to discuss the state of the AI industry, making several strong statements about AI demand. Huang told CNBC on Friday that demand for AI is "just incredibly high," stating that "the demand for Blackwell and our upcoming Vera Rubin platform is sky-high as nations and corporations realize that compute power is the new natural resource." Huang described the current moment as a definitive "inflection point," where AI is shifting from an experimental curiosity into a fundamental utility for every industry.

Huang stated during the interview: "We are witnessing the largest infrastructure buildout in human history." He said that the level of AI expenditures is appropriate and sustainable, and that the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure will continue for seven to eight years. Regarding compute constraints, Huang noted: "These guys are so compute-constrained, and demand is so incredibly great," referring to AI companies like Anthropic and OpenAI. Huang also defended the massive capital spending by hyperscalers, arguing that companies investing in AI infrastructure are making rational decisions that will pay off over the next decade.

Following the interview, shares of Nvidia surged more than 8% on Friday, February 6, 2026, contributing significantly to the broader market rally. The stock's performance helped propel the Dow past the 50,000 milestone and provided a counterpoint to concerns about AI spending raised by Amazon and Alphabet's massive capex plans. Huang's bullish comments reassured investors that the AI infrastructure buildout has substantial runway remaining, supporting the thesis that semiconductor companies and infrastructure providers will continue to benefit even as questions mount about the returns for those doing the spending.

### 8. S&P 500 Turns Negative for 2026 as $1 Trillion Wiped Out Before Friday Rebound
*Feb 5-6*

> The S&P 500 index officially turned red for the year during a volatile trading session on February 5, 2026, marking a dramatic reversal from the year's optimistic start, before recovering slightly on Friday's rally.

The S&P 500 index officially turned red for the year during a volatile trading session on February 6, 2026, marking a dramatic reversal from the year's optimistic start. After a promising January that saw the index climb 1.4%, a brutal three-day rout wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market capitalization. This sudden reversal sent shockwaves through Wall Street, as the benchmark index breached its critical 50-day moving average, triggering technical selling and forcing leveraged funds to reduce positions.

The selloff was driven by multiple factors. Disappointing tech earnings from major "hyperscalers" like Amazon and Alphabet reported massive capital expenditure increases that were not immediately met with the anticipated growth in cloud AI revenue. January's labor market data on February 5 showed the highest level of monthly layoffs since 2009—over 108,000 jobs lost—raising concerns about economic softening. A hawkish shift in the Federal Reserve's leadership forced institutional desks to aggressively deleverage, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiking to its highest levels of 2026.

Friday's 2% rally helped the S&P 500 recover some ground but left the index still negative for the year, reflecting the damage done during the mid-week selloff. The Nasdaq 100 saw its worst two-day rout since October during the first week of February 2026, with the tech-heavy index experiencing significant declines as investors rotated out of technology giants. The volatility underscored concerns about stretched valuations, uncertain AI returns, and a potentially softening economy, though Friday's rebound suggested that bargain hunters were willing to step in at lower levels.

### 9. January Layoffs Hit 108,435—Highest Since 2009—As Hiring Plans Collapse
*Feb 5*

> U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025, marking the highest January total since 2009 during the Great Recession's final months.

U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. This marked the highest January total since 2009, when the economy was in the final months of the Great Recession. About 40% of January's layoff announcements were tied to Amazon and UPS, which outlined plans for 16,000 and 30,000 job cuts, respectively. Transportation had the highest level from a sector standpoint in January, due largely to plans from UPS to cut more than 30,000 workers.

Companies announced just 5,306 new hires in January, the lowest January since 2009, when Challenger began tracking such data. The collapse in hiring plans combined with elevated layoff announcements painted a troubling picture of labor market softening at the start of 2026. Initial jobless claims for the week ended January 31 totaled a seasonally adjusted 231,000, the highest since early December, though the spike likely had something to do with a brutal winter storm that disrupted business activity across much of the country.

The biggest reasons cited for the month's planned cutbacks were contract loss (30,784), followed by market and economic conditions (28,392), restructuring (20,044) or closures (12,738). Artificial intelligence was cited for 7,624 cuts in January and tariffs were cited for 294 cuts last month, highlighting how both technological disruption and trade policy are affecting employment decisions. The data contributed to the broader market selloff in early February, raising questions about the strength of the economic expansion and the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts if labor market conditions continue to deteriorate.

### 10. Enphase Energy Soars 40% on Optimistic Solar Demand Outlook, Triggering Short Squeeze
*Feb 4-5*

> Enphase Energy stock surged almost 40% after the company stated it is bullish on long-term solar demand, with strong quarterly earnings and optimistic forward guidance triggering a vicious short squeeze that also lifted solar sector peers.

Enphase Energy stock surged almost 40% in recent weeks after the company stated it is bullish on long-term solar demand. The surge occurred following strong quarterly earnings and optimistic forward guidance. The company reported fourth-quarter 2025 earnings of $0.71 per share, exceeding analyst expectations, and fourth-quarter revenue of $343.3 million, with U.S. sell-through jumping 21% quarter-over-quarter as homeowners rushed to install solar systems before the Section 25D tax credit expired.

The company predicted revenue between $270 million and $300 million, exceeding the consensus expectation of $260 million. CEO Badri Kothandaraman told investors the company is "about 90% booked at the midpoint" and expects Q1 to mark the bottom, with improvements building throughout 2026. The massive rally in Enphase stock suggests investors believe the worst is over for the residential solar market, with the combination of lean channel inventory, stabilizing demand, and new financing structures dramatically shifting sentiment.

Peers also rallied on the news, with SolarEdge climbing 13% and Sunrun jumping 12.2%, indicating that the optimism extended beyond Enphase to the broader residential solar sector. The rally was amplified by a short squeeze, as bearish investors who had bet against the stock were forced to cover their positions as prices rose, creating additional buying pressure. Despite the surge, Europe's ongoing weakness adds concern, as does the uncertain impact of tariffs on margins, and William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer cautioned that the U.S. solar market could still decline roughly 20% this year despite the optimistic tone from Enphase.
