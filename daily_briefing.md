### 1. US-Iran Nuclear Talks Inch Forward as Trump Escalates Military Threat; War Within Weeks Feared
*Feb 18–19*

> A second round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations in Geneva concluded with both sides claiming "good progress" and agreement on guiding principles, but the diplomatic track is being overshadowed by Trump advisers warning of a 90% chance of kinetic military action within weeks as carrier strike groups remain on station in the Persian Gulf.

Following Tuesday's second round of US-Iran indirect nuclear talks in Geneva—mediated by Oman—Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said both sides reached "a broad agreement on guiding principles" and outlined a "clearer path ahead" toward a potential deal. The White House was far more cautious, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing "a little bit of progress" while noting the two sides remain "very far apart on some issues." Tehran is expected to provide detailed proposals within two weeks, after which a third round of talks would be scheduled.

The diplomatic momentum is running directly against a militaristic countercurrent. Axios reported Wednesday that Trump is moving closer to a major strike on Iran, with one senior adviser estimating a 90% probability of US kinetic action within weeks. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has been redeployed to the Persian Gulf alongside existing assets, giving Washington a full range of airstrike options. Israel's government, which is pushing for maximalist objectives including regime change, is reportedly preparing for a war scenario within days. Senator Lindsey Graham said strikes could still be "weeks away," and multiple Trump advisers are actively urging the president against military action.

Iran's supreme leader Khamenei separately warned Trump against military escalation, and Tehran has stated it is "ready to respond" to any US attack. Iran's demands include substantial sanctions relief; it has ruled out negotiations on ballistic missiles or its regional proxy network—red lines that clash directly with Israeli and US hawkish demands. The combination of halting diplomatic progress and escalating military posturing makes the Iran file the most acute flashpoint in international security, with oil markets already pricing in risk premium.

### 2. Geneva Ukraine-Russia Peace Talks End Abruptly in Mixed Signals; Zelensky Accuses Moscow of Stalling
*Feb 18*

> The second day of US-brokered Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Geneva ended abruptly after only about two hours, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of deliberately dragging out negotiations and Russia calling talks "difficult but business-like"—leaving the peace process mired in contradictory assessments as Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff maintains both sides remain committed to continuing.

The second round of trilateral Geneva talks concluded on February 18 with Ukraine and Russia offering starkly different accounts of progress. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X that "Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage," accusing Moscow of deliberate stalling. Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky described the session as "difficult but practical" and said the next round is expected "soon." Trump envoy Steve Witkoff stated both parties remain committed to the process, while military officials from all three sides said they made "incremental but significant progress" on the mechanics of how a ceasefire would actually work.

The key substantive issues on the table—territorial arrangements, energy security, and control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant—remain unresolved. Russia continues to insist Ukraine withdraw from Donbas as a precondition for any ceasefire, a demand Kyiv calls a non-starter. Ukraine, for its part, has indicated it is ready to monitor a ceasefire if the political will exists. The talks also touched on a new prisoner-of-war exchange and civilian release mechanisms, areas where both sides have previously found more common ground.

Foreign Policy reported the talks were "cut short," and Geneva Solutions described the conclusion as "abrupt with mixed signals." The second round leaves the peace process in an ambiguous state: the process is alive, but substantive gaps remain enormous. Zelensky's public accusation of Russian stalling—an unusually direct statement while talks are nominally ongoing—suggests Kyiv is managing domestic pressure and signaling to Washington that Moscow, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to a deal.

### 3. Trump's Board of Peace Convenes for First Meeting as UN Security Council Warns Over West Bank Settlements
*Feb 18–19*

> Trump's newly formed Board of Peace held its inaugural meeting with pledges exceeding $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction commitments, as the UN Security Council—convening in an emergency session the day before—blasted Israeli approval of 19 new West Bank settlements as an existential threat to the peace process and a violation of international law.

The Trump administration's Board of Peace convened for its inaugural session on February 19, drawing together Gulf Arab states, European partners, and international institutions to begin organizing Gaza's post-conflict reconstruction. Trump announced the board has already secured more than $5 billion in pledges toward humanitarian aid and reconstruction from member states. The meeting represents the formal launch of what the administration calls a "20-point Comprehensive Plan" for Gaza's future, with Phase 2 now focused on demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction.

The day prior, the UN Security Council held an emergency high-level session specifically timed to occur before the Board of Peace convened, with diplomats from dozens of countries delivering sharp condemnations of Israel's approval of 19 new West Bank settlements—including re-establishment of evacuated 2005 settlements—as threatening the entire framework for a two-state solution. Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour called annexation "a breach of the UN Charter" and an "existential threat to ongoing peace efforts," while multiple Arab Group delegations condemned the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and settler violence.

The convergence of the Board of Peace launch and UN Security Council emergency session illustrates the fractured international landscape surrounding Gaza policy. Trump's Board of Peace excludes the UN as a governing body—itself a flashpoint—while the administration simultaneously pursues reconstruction pledges from countries deeply critical of Israeli settlement expansion. The body of the last Israeli hostage, Ran Gvili, was recovered from Gaza in January, formally clearing the way for Phase 2, but Hamas remains armed and Israeli forces continue to occupy more than half the enclave.

### 4. India Hosts Global AI Impact Summit; Modi and Macron Sign Rafale Deal and AI Governance Declaration
*Feb 19*

> Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India's landmark AI Impact Summit at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi on February 19, with French President Emmanuel Macron, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, and more than 20 heads of state in attendance; the summit produced a sovereign AI governance declaration, a finalized inter-governmental Rafale fighter jet agreement for 114 aircraft, and $1.1 billion in Indian state venture capital commitments to AI.

Prime Minister Modi opened the India AI Impact Summit 2026—a six-day event under the theme "welfare for all, happiness for all"—with attendance from over 20 heads of state, 60 ministers, and 500 global AI leaders in what organizers billed as the world's largest government-organized AI event. French President Macron, who arrived in India on February 16 for a three-day bilateral visit, addressed the opening ceremony and declared that India and France share "the same objective on AI innovation" and must avoid being "totally dependent" on US or Chinese models—framing the two countries as anchors for a third pole in global AI governance.

The summit produced several concrete announcements: India earmarked $1.1 billion for a state-backed venture capital fund targeting AI and advanced manufacturing startups; Indian conglomerate Adani announced a $100 billion commitment to build AI data centers powered by renewable energy by 2035. In a major bilateral defense milestone, India and France formalized the inter-governmental agreement for 114 Rafale fighter jets—one of India's largest-ever defense acquisitions—with both governments signing during Macron's visit. India and France also agreed to triple student exchanges from 10,000 annually to 30,000 by 2030.

The summit reflects India's strategic ambition to position itself as a global AI governance standard-setter rather than merely a technology consumer or outsourcing hub. Modi's framing of "Sovereign AI"—national AI infrastructure built on Indian data and Indian compute—aligns with France's parallel "AI sovereignty" agenda and provides an alternative governance model to the US-dominated and China-state-controlled approaches. The summit is not expected to produce a binding multilateral agreement, but a nonbinding declaration on AI safety, access, and governance is anticipated before the event closes.

### 5. DRC Ceasefire With Rwanda-Backed M23 Collapses as Rebels Reject Angola Framework; UN Monitors Caught in Middle
*Feb 18–19*

> An Angola-brokered ceasefire between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels that was supposed to take effect on February 18 collapsed almost immediately, with M23 claiming it was never properly consulted on the terms and accusing Kinshasa of violations, while fighting continued in South Kivu even as UN peacekeepers moved to deploy monitoring teams.

The Angola-proposed ceasefire between the DRC government and M23 rebels—announced with a February 18 effective date—effectively collapsed before it began, with M23 stating it had "not been informed or invited" to negotiate the terms of the agreement and accusing Kinshasa of multiple ongoing ceasefire violations on the ground. DRC President Félix Tshisekedi had accepted "the principle of a ceasefire" with a "strict and immediate" freezing of positions, but M23's refusal to endorse the specific Angolan framework left the agreement without both parties' genuine commitment. Clashes continued in the hills of South Kivu around Minembwe town even as diplomats attempted to salvage the peace framework.

The UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO has been attempting to operationalize a monitoring mechanism signed in early February under the Doha Framework, with acting MONUSCO head Vivian van de Perre visiting M23-held Goma to begin preparations. However, the collapse of the ceasefire agreement leaves UN monitors without the basic conditions needed for effective deployment. The UN Security Council warned this week that violence continues to persist despite diplomatic progress and that the humanitarian situation in eastern DRC remains catastrophic.

M23's rapid advance in 2025—capturing first Goma, capital of North Kivu, then Bukavu, capital of South Kivu—has created a sprawling humanitarian emergency. The rebel group's continued rejection of internationally proposed frameworks reflects the deep complexity of the conflict, in which Rwanda's role as a state sponsor of M23 remains the central unresolved geopolitical variable that neither Angola nor the UN has managed to directly address.

### 6. Venezuela: US Issues New Oil Licenses for Western Energy Companies as Post-Maduro Transition Advances
*Feb 17–19*

> The US Treasury's OFAC issued General License 48 this month expanding authorization for US energy companies to conduct upstream oil and gas exploration and production activities in Venezuela, as Washington moves from sanctions-era restriction to strategic control of the world's largest proven oil reserves following Nicolás Maduro's capture in January.

Following Maduro's capture in early January 2026 and his transfer to US custody in New York, the Trump administration has been systematically rebuilding the framework for Western energy company operations in Venezuela. The Office of Foreign Assets Control issued General License 48 on February 10, authorizing additional upstream activities for oil and gas exploration and production, including well maintenance and rehabilitation of aged Venezuelan oil infrastructure—building on Licenses 46 and 47 that authorized US companies to lift and transport Venezuelan oil. SLB is deploying advanced seismic imaging and horizontal drilling technology to revive mature fields, while Halliburton has begun recruiting to rehabilitate over 10,000 aging wells.

Analysts project Venezuelan production could reach 1.5 million barrels per day by end of 2026, more than doubling from the 800,000 bpd of early 2024 but still far below the country's 1990s peak of 3 million bpd. Venezuela's interim government under acting president Delcy Rodriguez has been attempting to reassure Chinese investors that oil prices will not be set by Washington—Beijing had absorbed most Venezuelan crude exports at steep discounts under Maduro's sanctions-era arrangements and condemned the US military operation. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are both positioned to recover assets seized in Venezuela's 2007 nationalization.

The Council on Foreign Relations noted this week that "Trump's Venezuela policy isn't any clearer a month after Maduro's capture," with the only definite policy being indefinite US control over Venezuelan oil marketing. The contradictions between championing "sovereignty" for Venezuela's new government while maintaining OFAC controls over its primary revenue source have created significant diplomatic tensions, particularly with China, whose oil financing deals with the Maduro government are now in legal limbo.

### 7. Trump Unveils 10% Import Tax on Eight European Countries Over Greenland Stance
*Feb 18–19*

> President Trump announced a 10% import tax on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland—directly tying the new tariffs to European governments' opposition to US ambitions over Greenland, in the latest escalation of transatlantic trade tensions that are straining NATO cohesion.

President Trump announced Saturday and moved forward with implementation of a 10% import tariff on goods from eight European countries specifically named as opponents of US Greenland acquisition ambitions: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland. The tariff announcement—structured as retaliation for European governments' "disrespect" for American strategic interests in the Arctic—immediately rattled stock markets and prompted European foreign ministers to convene emergency consultations. The EU's trade commissioner signaled the bloc would respond with targeted countermeasures on US goods.

The Greenland-linked tariff escalation sits alongside existing Section 232 tariffs of 25% on European steel and aluminum imports, which the EU has responded to with proportionate countermeasures on US textiles, home appliances, and agricultural goods. Trump's potential rollback of some steel and aluminum tariffs on processed goods—reported by the Financial Times—has not materialized, leaving European manufacturers facing compounding trade barriers. The cumulative tariff burden on transatlantic trade is now at levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley era, with European business groups warning of supply chain disruption and retaliatory cycles that could accelerate the fragmentation of Western economic integration.

Analysts at the Council on Foreign Relations noted that linking tariffs explicitly to Greenland represents a significant doctrinal shift—using trade policy as a direct coercive instrument in territorial disputes rather than as a standalone economic tool—raising questions about the precedent this sets for other territorial disputes where the US may seek leverage. European officials privately expressed concern that the Greenland tariff escalation is deliberately designed to force a bilateral negotiation on US terms rather than through NATO or multilateral frameworks.

### 8. Gaza Phase 2 Challenges Deepen: Hamas Refuses Disarmament While International Stabilization Force Lacks Troops
*Feb 18–19*

> The second phase of Trump's Gaza ceasefire framework is struggling to launch in practice even as the Board of Peace pledges $5 billion in reconstruction funds, with Hamas firmly rejecting full disarmament, fewer than 2,000 international stabilization force personnel committed against a requirement of 15,000, and more than 450 Gazans killed since the ceasefire's October start.

The Trump administration's 20-point Gaza peace plan is encountering severe implementation challenges as it formally enters Phase 2. UN Middle East peace coordinator Tor Wennesland told the Security Council that more than 450 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began in October—a figure that raises fundamental questions about the ceasefire's effectiveness. Israel continues to control more than half of the Gaza enclave. Hamas has publicly stated it has "never" agreed to lay down all its weapons, offering only to discuss "which weapons" might be removed—a formulation incompatible with the Phase 2 demilitarization requirement.

The International Stabilization Force envisioned as the security backbone of Phase 2 remains critically understaffed. Despite Indonesia committing 8,000 troops by June 2026 and Egypt expressing conditional interest, the force is far below the 15,000 personnel threshold analysts say is the minimum for stabilization duties in Gaza. The absence of a credible ISF makes other Phase 2 elements—Hamas disarmament, technocratic Palestinian governance, and a framework for Israeli withdrawal—essentially unworkable in sequence. Chatham House researchers assessed this week that "Phase Two of Gaza's ceasefire will fail without a political vision for Palestine."

Despite these structural obstacles, the Board of Peace's inaugural meeting succeeded in mobilizing financial pledges above $5 billion, demonstrating that Gulf Arab states and European partners are willing to fund reconstruction even amid unresolved political questions. The fundamental tension remains: the US wants to proceed with reconstruction before resolving governance and security arrangements, while most other international stakeholders insist that durable reconstruction requires a credible political framework for Palestinian self-governance that is not yet in place.

### 9. UK Prime Minister Starmer Launches European Defense Coalition; Proposes Military Hubs in Ukraine
*Feb 18–19*

> British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is advancing a multinational European defense initiative that would deploy military hubs inside Ukraine as part of a potential peace guarantee, with France and the UK as the framework's core, amid broader concerns about US reliability under Trump that are accelerating European rearmament plans.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been leading an intensive diplomatic push to build a European defense coalition capable of providing security guarantees to Ukraine independent of US commitment. Working in close coordination with French President Macron—who has been simultaneously advancing the initiative during his India visit—Starmer has proposed deploying "military hubs" inside Ukraine staffed by European personnel as a visible deterrence force that would complicate any future Russian military action. The framework is designed to be a European guarantee that does not require US participation but would be welcomed if Washington chose to join.

The proposal builds on the Paris talks from earlier in 2026, where France and the UK pledged to be the core nations for any security guarantee architecture. As of this week, approximately 30 European nations have been briefed on various aspects of the coalition framework, though formal commitments from Central and Eastern European states—some of which have reservations about measures that could be seen as provoking Russia—have been more cautious. Germany's new Merz government, which took office in May 2025, has been broadly supportive of increased defense commitments but has its own fiscal and constitutional constraints.

The urgency of European defense self-sufficiency has been accelerated by Trump's tariff escalation against European allies and continued ambiguity about US Article 5 commitments. The Munich Security Conference's opening statement earlier this month warned explicitly that NATO's transatlantic dimension faces an "existential test" and that Europe must prepare to defend itself with or without American leadership. Starmer's initiative represents the most concrete European response to that warning, though its success depends on whether European nations can translate rhetorical commitment into actual troop and equipment pledges.

### 10. Congo Cholera Outbreak Spreads as MSF Warns of 25-Year Record; 2 Million Cases Feared by Mid-Year
*Feb 18–19*

> Médecins Sans Frontières warned this week that the Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing its worst cholera outbreak in 25 years, with the ongoing conflict in eastern DRC preventing medical access to hundreds of thousands of displaced people and humanitarian organizations warning that 2 million cases could be recorded by mid-2026 if the fighting does not stop.

The humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been compounded by a catastrophic cholera outbreak that MSF describes as the worst in 25 years. More than 37,000 cholera cases have been recorded since the beginning of 2026, with the outbreak most acute in displacement camps around former urban centers like Goma, where M23 forces ejected hundreds of thousands of civilians during their 2025 offensive. Contaminated water sources, collapsed sanitation infrastructure, and the near-total absence of functional healthcare facilities in conflict zones have created conditions for explosive viral transmission.

The ongoing failure of the February 18 ceasefire—with M23 rejecting the Angola framework and fighting continuing in South Kivu—means humanitarian organizations cannot safely access many of the most affected populations. MSF field teams have reported being unable to reach displacement camps within 20-30 kilometers of active fighting. The World Health Organization has issued its highest-level humanitarian alert for eastern DRC for the third consecutive month, and UNICEF has warned that acute malnutrition rates among under-5 children in Kivu provinces have reached emergency famine thresholds.

International donors pledged additional emergency funding at a Geneva humanitarian conference last week, but aid organizations say the fundamental obstacle is not funding—it is physical access blocked by the conflict. The UN humanitarian coordinator for DRC called for an immediate humanitarian corridor agreement between the DRC government and M23 as a minimum precondition for medical intervention, a proposal that the ongoing collapse of the ceasefire framework has made politically impossible in the near term.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. S&P 500 Rises to Near-Record 6,891 as Nvidia-Meta Mega-Deal Lifts AI Stocks; Markets Absorb FOMC Minutes
*Feb 18–19*

> The S&P 500 climbed 0.56–0.58% to close near 6,891 on Wednesday, driven by a Nvidia-Meta multi-year AI chip deal that sent Nvidia shares up more than 2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.78% to reach 22,753—a risk-on session that helped investors look past Federal Reserve meeting minutes showing internal divisions over the rate path.

The S&P 500 rose 0.56% to close at approximately 6,881–6,891 on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.78% to 22,753 and the Dow Jones adding 0.26% to 49,662. The session was dominated by the Nvidia-Meta announcement: Meta signed a multiyear deal to purchase millions of Nvidia AI chips including the first large-scale deployment of Nvidia's Grace CPUs as standalone processors in Meta's data centers, alongside expanded Spectrum-X networking and GB300 systems. The deal—estimated in the tens of billions of dollars—provided a powerful signal that AI infrastructure demand remains robust despite broader market jitters about AI disruption, lifting Nvidia more than 2% on the day.

Federal Reserve meeting minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC meeting, released Wednesday afternoon, showed that while policymakers broadly supported holding rates steady at 3.5–3.75%, there is meaningful internal disagreement about what happens next. The 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 3 basis points to 4.087% after the minutes' release, with the 30-year bond yield up more than 2 basis points to 4.711%, suggesting markets interpreted the minutes as modestly hawkish. CME FedWatch pricing continues to imply that the earliest likely rate cut is sometime in mid-2026.

On February 19, the market moved into earnings-heavy territory with pre-market releases from Walmart and Deere before the bell. The 247 Wall St. live tracker showed the S&P 500 (SPY) up ahead of key economic data releases, suggesting the rally was holding into Thursday's session. Investors are also bracing for Friday's data deluge: Q4 2025 GDP advance estimate, December PCE inflation (expected at 2.8% core year-on-year), and December personal income and spending data, which analysts call a potential "inflection point" for the first half of 2026 rate path.

### 2. Walmart Reports Q4 FY2026 Earnings; Consumer Resilience Tested Against Post-Shutdown Backdrop
*Feb 19*

> Walmart released its Q4 FY2026 earnings on February 19 before the opening bell, with Wall Street watching the world's largest retailer—now a $1 trillion market-cap company—as the definitive read on US consumer health following a federal government shutdown and mounting tariff-driven cost pressures.

Walmart's Q4 FY2026 earnings report, released before the opening bell on February 19, was the day's most closely watched corporate event. Consensus analyst expectations called for adjusted EPS of $0.73 (nearly 10% above the prior-year $0.66) and revenue of $188.6–190.5 billion—roughly 6% year-over-year growth—driven by a projected 4.1% increase in US comparable-store sales excluding fuel. The company formally joined the $1 trillion market-capitalization club earlier in February, reflecting investor confidence in its pivot toward high-margin advertising and automated logistics services.

The results carry outsized significance as a consumer barometer because Walmart serves shoppers across all income levels but has been specifically benefiting from an "upscale shift"—higher-income Americans who typically shop at premium grocers have been increasingly shopping at Walmart due to cost pressures. Wells Fargo analysts anticipated a solid Q4 with same-store sales growth above 4.5% and a slight EPS beat. UBS similarly expected a beat plus an achievable initial guidance set for FY2027. The results are particularly meaningful given that the US experienced a brief federal government shutdown in February that disrupted consumer confidence and reduced discretionary spending.

Walmart has been navigating the dual challenge of tariff cost pass-through and supply chain reshoring demands under Trump administration pressure. Its scale gives it more negotiating leverage with suppliers than smaller retailers, but the company's international sourcing from China and Southeast Asia means it faces direct exposure to the current 30%+ effective tariff rate on Chinese goods. Any guidance commentary on tariff headwinds for FY2027 is expected to be closely parsed by analysts covering the broader retail sector.

### 3. Deere Q1 FY2026 Earnings Released; Agricultural Equipment Maker Faces 40% Profit Drop as Farm Cycle Bottoms
*Feb 19*

> John Deere released Q1 FY2026 earnings before the market open on February 19, with analysts expecting a 39.8% year-over-year EPS decline to $1.92 and revenues of $7.60 billion as the agricultural equipment cycle hits a trough—though Deere's precision agriculture technology investments and potential tariff protection for US manufacturing offer structural offsets.

John Deere & Company released its first-quarter fiscal 2026 results before the opening bell on February 19, with the consensus estimate calling for earnings of $1.92 per share—a steep 39.8% decline from the year-earlier quarter—and revenues of $7.60 billion, representing 11.7% year-over-year growth due in part to the Q4 2025 revenue surge. The sharp earnings decline reflects the severe cyclical downturn in agricultural equipment demand, as farm commodity prices have fallen from their post-pandemic highs and farmer income has deteriorated, leading to a significant pullback in equipment purchases across the industry.

Deere's production and precision agriculture segment—its largest revenue contributor—is expected to post revenues near prior-year levels but with dramatically compressed margins in the low single digits, per management's own guidance. The construction equipment segment has shown more resilience due to US infrastructure investment, but it cannot offset the magnitude of the ag downturn. Deere has been investing heavily in autonomy and precision agriculture technology—including its acquisition of GUSS Automation—as a long-term competitive differentiator, but these investments weigh on near-term margins during a cyclical trough.

The company's guidance commentary will be closely watched for signals about when the agricultural equipment cycle is expected to bottom. Some analysts argue the trough is already in and that 2026 represents the last year of severe compression, with a recovery cycle beginning in 2027 as commodity prices stabilize and farmers resume deferred capital spending. Any positive guidance revision or upbeat commentary on order trends in early Q2 could provide significant upside to Deere shares, which have already declined substantially from their 2024 highs.

### 4. FOMC Minutes Reveal Fed Division on Rate Path; Treasury Yields Tick Higher as Cut Timeline Recedes
*Feb 18–19*

> Federal Reserve minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC meeting showed broad agreement on holding rates steady at 3.5–3.75% but significant internal disagreement about what conditions would justify future cuts, sending Treasury yields modestly higher and reinforcing market expectations that rate cuts have been pushed to mid-2026 at the earliest.

The Federal Reserve released minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC meeting on Wednesday afternoon, providing investors with the clearest picture yet of internal disagreement about the policy path. While the decision to hold rates at 3.5–3.75% was broadly supported across the committee, the minutes revealed divergent views on when and under what conditions the Fed should resume cutting. Some officials argued that sticky inflation and a still-solid labor market make any near-term cut premature; others emphasized that the lagged effects of previous tightening and an uncertain tariff environment justify keeping the option of cuts on the table.

The release pushed the 10-year Treasury yield up 3+ basis points to 4.087%, the 30-year bond to 4.711%, and the 2-year note to 3.468%—a modest but notable market reaction indicating participants interpreted the minutes as leaning hawkish. CME FedWatch probabilities for a March 2026 rate cut fell to below 5% following the release, with the first fully-priced cut now expected no earlier than June 2026. The CNBC live blog headline captured the market mood: "Treasury yields rise as Fed minutes show disagreement on next rate cut."

Friday's simultaneous release of Q4 2025 GDP (advance estimate) and December PCE inflation data will be critical inputs for the Fed's March meeting deliberations. Core PCE is expected at 2.8% year-on-year, still above the Fed's 2% target. Wall Street analysts have described the Friday data release as a "data deluge" that will "dictate the 2026 interest rate path"—a characterization that underscores just how much uncertainty remains about the trajectory of monetary policy even as the economy shows signs of resilience.

### 5. Friday Data Deluge Preview: Q4 GDP, PCE, and Personal Income Reports Set to Reshape Rate Expectations
*Feb 18–19*

> Wall Street is bracing for simultaneous Friday release of Q4 2025 GDP advance estimate, December PCE inflation data (core expected at 2.8% year-on-year), and December personal income and spending figures—a data trifecta that analysts describe as the most consequential economic release of the first quarter in setting the Fed's rate cut timeline for 2026.

The economic calendar for Friday, February 20 is drawing extraordinary attention from market participants. Three major data releases are scheduled simultaneously: the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish the advance estimate of Q4 2025 GDP growth; the December PCE inflation reading (the Fed's preferred inflation gauge), with core PCE expected at 2.8% year-on-year; and December personal income and spending data, which will show whether consumer demand softened meaningfully at year-end. Additionally, the final February University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey will be published, likely reflecting anxiety about tariffs and the government shutdown.

Analysts at MarketMinute described the Friday lineup as an "inflection point" for the first half of 2026: if growth is stronger than expected while inflation remains elevated, market pricing for rate cuts will be pushed further out, potentially through year-end. If growth is slowing while inflation is also moderating, the Fed gains room to cut in June or July. A stagflation scenario—slowing growth with sticky inflation—is seen as the most disruptive outcome, as it would leave the Fed paralyzed between competing mandates while economic conditions deteriorate.

The Q4 GDP reading will also be closely scrutinized for consumption, investment, and government spending components, given that the federal government shutdown and DOGE-driven spending cuts are expected to have begun registering in December data. Earlier estimates from regional Fed banks had projected Q4 growth in the 1.5–2.5% range annualized. A reading below 1.5% combined with PCE above 2.8% would almost certainly trigger a broader market repricing of risk assets heading into the weekend.

### 6. Venezuela Oil Sector Reopens to US Companies as OFAC License 48 Authorizes Upstream Exploration
*Feb 17–19*

> The US Treasury's OFAC issued General License 48 authorizing US oil companies to conduct upstream exploration and production activities in Venezuela, marking the most significant regulatory opening of Venezuela's energy sector to Western companies since the Maduro era—with analysts projecting output could nearly double to 1.5 million barrels per day by end of 2026.

Following the issuance of General Licenses 46 and 47 authorizing US companies to lift and transport Venezuelan crude, OFAC's February 10 General License 48 expanded authorization to cover upstream oil and gas exploration and production activities, including maintenance and rehabilitation of Venezuela's aged oil infrastructure. SLB has begun deploying advanced seismic imaging and horizontal drilling technology to revive mature Orinoco Belt fields, while Halliburton has launched a major recruitment drive to rehabilitate over 10,000 aging "stripper" wells. Bloomberg reported this week that US companies are now actively producing oil and gas in Venezuela under the new license framework.

The reopening of Venezuela to US energy companies creates significant geopolitical complexity. Venezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves (303 billion barrels), and the combination of Western capital and technology could eventually restore it to major producer status. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, whose assets were nationalized in 2007, are positioned to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new framework. However, Venezuela's interim government under Delcy Rodriguez has been actively reassuring Chinese investors—Beijing had provided critical financing to the Maduro regime in exchange for discounted oil—that the new arrangement will not leave China's investments stranded.

Colombia University's Center on Global Energy Policy assessed this week that US actions have "severely impacted Venezuela-China oil ties" and are disrupting debt repayment flows from Caracas to Beijing, creating a potential financial flashpoint in US-China relations. The geopolitical stakes are amplified by the fact that Venezuelan oil production recovery—if it proceeds quickly—could add significant barrels to global supply at a time when US shale growth is slowing, potentially weighing on oil prices and affecting OPEC+ cohesion heading into its next production strategy review.

### 7. Gold Holds Near $4,950–4,970 as Iran War Risk Premium Offsets Profit-Taking; Week's Outlook Hinges on PCE
*Feb 18–19*

> Gold consolidated near $4,950–4,970 per ounce on Wednesday and Thursday, with upside capped by profit-taking following January's record run above $5,500 but downside limited by the Iran military strike risk premium building in the market—leaving the precious metal poised for a directional break after Friday's PCE and GDP data.

Gold traded in a narrow range of $4,950–4,970 per ounce through Wednesday and into Thursday morning, as the market balanced competing forces. The Iran risk premium—driven by Axios reporting of a 90% probability of US military action within weeks—provided support, as did persistent central bank buying from emerging market central banks continuing to diversify away from US dollar reserves. However, profit-taking pressure from institutional investors who bought gold during January's historic rally to above $5,500 is creating a ceiling. Today's price is also roughly $88 per ounce above Monday's close, suggesting some incremental safe-haven buying driven by geopolitical news flow.

Goldman Sachs raised its 2026 gold price target to $5,400 in a research note earlier this month, citing central bank demand, geopolitical risk premia, and its expectation that the Fed's rate cut cycle will resume in mid-2026. Goldman's analysts specifically cited the Iran escalation risk and the uncertainty around US tariff policy as factors that make gold's safe-haven demand structural rather than transient. JPMorgan has maintained a somewhat more cautious view, noting that at current price levels, gold is pricing in a significant degree of geopolitical risk that could rapidly unwind if either a US-Iran deal is reached or military action is avoided.

The critical test for gold will come Friday with the PCE and GDP data releases. A softer-than-expected core PCE reading that signals the Fed might cut in June could push gold higher on reduced real yield expectations. Conversely, a strong GDP reading combined with sticky inflation—confirming the hawkish FOMC minutes narrative—could trigger another leg down from record highs as real yields firm. Bitcoin also remains an alternative risk indicator, trading near $67,263 on Wednesday after extended ETF outflows, with the crypto market struggling to find a catalyst for recovery.

### 8. Oil Surges on Iran War Risk as US Carrier Groups Position; Analysts Warn of Downside if Deal Reached
*Feb 18–19*

> Oil prices surged more than 2% on Wednesday as Axios reporting on a 90% probability of US military strikes on Iran within weeks injected a substantial risk premium into crude markets, pushing WTI toward $64–65; technical analysts warned the move could reverse sharply if diplomatic channels succeed in containing the Iran confrontation.

Crude oil prices surged sharply on Wednesday after the Axios report warning of near-certain US military action against Iran triggered a rapid repricing of geopolitical risk. WTI crude rose approximately 2.6% to near $64 per barrel, with Brent tracking proportionally higher, as traders focused on the potential disruption to Iranian oil exports (approximately 1.5 million bpd) and the broader risk to Strait of Hormuz transit that carries roughly 20% of global oil supply. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group's redeployment to the Persian Gulf—alongside the previously positioned Gerald R. Ford—has made the military option more credible than at any point in the recent US-Iran confrontation.

Analysts are divided on sustainability. Bears point out that the Iran risk premium is already partially priced in, that Venezuelan oil production ramp-up will add supply over the course of 2026, and that OPEC+ has significant spare capacity it could deploy if Iranian barrels were disrupted. The International Energy Agency had already lowered its global demand forecast earlier this month, suggesting the market is well-supplied absent a conflict scenario. Technical analysts noted that the WTI chart shows significant downside risk if prices fail to sustain above the $65 resistance level, with a potential retreat to $58–60 if the Iran situation de-escalates.

The oil market is also being influenced by the Venezuela reopening, with OFAC's upstream license expansion indicating that US policymakers are actively working to grow Venezuelan supply as a strategic counterweight to Iranian supply risk and OPEC influence. If Venezuelan production achieves the 1.5 million bpd target by year-end, the net supply addition would roughly offset the full loss of Iranian exports—providing a geopolitical hedge that markets have not yet fully priced.

### 9. Pending Home Sales Data Released; Housing Market Continues Seasonal Struggle Under 7%+ Mortgage Rates
*Feb 19*

> The National Association of Realtors released January 2026 Pending Home Sales data on February 19 at 10 a.m. Eastern, providing the latest read on contract signing activity in a housing market that recorded an 8.4% existing home sales decline in January—the largest monthly drop in over a year, driven by mortgage rates holding stubbornly above 7%.

The NAR's January 2026 Pending Home Sales Index—released February 19 at 10 a.m. Eastern—provided the freshest data on housing contract activity for a sector that has been under significant pressure. The January existing home sales report, released last week, showed an 8.4% monthly decrease, the steepest decline in over a year, as mortgage rates held above 7% and consumer confidence dropped to decade lows. Pending home sales are a leading indicator that typically precedes existing home sales by one to two months, making the January pending data a preview of February and March closings.

The housing market's struggle is multifaceted. The Federal Reserve's rates-on-hold stance means mortgage rates are unlikely to fall significantly in the near term; the FOMC minutes released Wednesday confirmed no rate cuts are imminent. Meanwhile, the federal government shutdown that disrupted household finances in February is expected to create additional hesitancy among prospective buyers. On the supply side, inventory has been rising year-over-year—up approximately 10% as of the December data—providing some relief to buyers who can afford current rates, but the affordability crisis is keeping first-time buyers effectively locked out.

The housing data has broader economic implications given construction, real estate, and financial services account for a significant portion of US GDP. Friday's Q4 GDP advance estimate will show the December contribution from residential investment and mortgage refinancing activity. Analysts at CNBC noted that mortgage rates at current levels create a "lock-in effect"—homeowners with sub-4% mortgages from 2020-21 are unwilling to sell and take on new debt at 7%+, further constraining supply and keeping transaction volumes depressed regardless of demand conditions.

### 10. Warner Bros. Discovery Reopens Paramount Talks; Netflix Waiver Through Feb 23 Extends Deal Window
*Feb 18–19*

> Warner Bros. Discovery has reopened acquisition talks with Paramount Global after previously collapsed negotiations, with Netflix granting a limited content waiver through February 23 that extends the window for a potential deal—setting up a pivotal week for media sector M&A as the industry continues to consolidate under streaming-era economics.

Warner Bros. Discovery reopened acquisition discussions with Paramount Global this week after earlier talks broke down, according to reports from Axios and multiple media industry sources. The renewed discussions come as Netflix granted Paramount a limited content waiver through February 23, providing a brief window for deal negotiations without triggering content licensing conflicts with Paramount's existing Netflix agreements. The waiver deadline creates explicit urgency: both parties must either reach a deal framework by February 23 or face renewed licensing complications that would complicate any future combination.

The media landscape has been in a period of intense consolidation as legacy media companies struggle to compete with streaming giants Netflix and Disney+. Warner Bros. Discovery itself was formed from the 2022 merger of Discovery and AT&T's WarnerMedia, and has been working to pay down significant debt while rebuilding its streaming strategy through Max. A potential WBD-Paramount combination would create the largest legacy media company by content library, giving the combined entity greater negotiating leverage with streaming platforms, advertisers, and sports leagues.

The reopening of talks coincides with broader M&A momentum in the media sector. Sumitomo Forestry's $4.5 billion acquisition of Tri Pointe Homes—announced this week—shows that cross-border deals are actively occurring across sectors, and media bankers have noted that the current macro environment of elevated but stabilizing rates is conducive to large strategic transactions. Any concrete announcement from WBD and Paramount would likely be a significant catalyst for media sector stocks, which have been underperforming the broader market for much of the past two years.
