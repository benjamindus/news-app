### 1. Iran Closes Strait of Hormuz for Live-Fire Drills as US-Iran Geneva Nuclear Talks Reach "Guiding Principles"
*Feb 17*

> Iran temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz for Revolutionary Guard naval exercises even as its diplomats in Geneva reached a "general agreement" on guiding principles with U.S. envoys—a simultaneous show of force and diplomatic opening that represents the most significant development in US-Iran relations in years.

Iran announced the temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz—the first such closure since the U.S. began threatening military action and rushing military assets to the region—as Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps units conducted live-fire naval drills in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. The closures lasted only a few hours but sent an unmistakable signal of Tehran's military posture at the very moment its negotiators sat down with U.S. envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, in Geneva for a second round of indirect nuclear talks mediated by Oman. By day's end, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced the two sides had reached an understanding on "guiding principles" as the basis for moving forward and drafting a potential agreement text.

Iran's supreme leader separately warned Trump against military escalation, while U.S. officials maintained that all options remain on the table pending diplomatic progress. Araghchi cautioned that "the path has begun but we will not reach it quickly," with both sides to exchange draft texts before scheduling a third round. The Strait of Hormuz carries roughly 20% of the world's oil supply, and its temporary closure drew immediate concern from global shipping markets even as diplomats in Switzerland declared progress.

Two U.S. carrier strike groups—the Abraham Lincoln and Gerald R. Ford—remain positioned in the region, maintaining American military pressure even as the diplomatic track advances. The dual-track strategy reflects the Trump administration's approach: maximum pressure combined with selective diplomatic engagement, a formula that supporters argue forced Iran to the table and critics warn could easily tip into miscalculation and conflict.

### 2. India Seizes Three US-Sanctioned Iran-Linked Oil Tankers Off Mumbai
*Feb 17*

> Indian Coast Guard vessels intercepted three oil tankers operating near Mumbai linked to U.S.-sanctioned entities facilitating Iranian oil exports, marking one of India's most assertive maritime enforcement actions against the Iranian shadow fleet and signaling a significant strategic shift toward Washington's sanctions framework.

Indian Coast Guard vessels intercepted three oil tankers operating approximately 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai in India's Exclusive Economic Zone after surveillance systems detected suspicious activity consistent with illicit ship-to-ship oil transfers. The three vessels—identified as Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star, and Al Jafzia—had reportedly changed names and flags to conceal their identities and are linked to entities blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury for facilitating Iranian oil exports in violation of American sanctions. Shipping data shows Al Jafzia transported fuel oil from Iran to Djibouti in 2025, while Stellar Ruby had previously flown an Iranian flag.

India has deployed approximately 55 Coast Guard ships and 10-12 aircraft for round-the-clock maritime surveillance in response to the intercepts, reflecting a sustained enforcement posture rather than an isolated incident. The seizures follow an improvement in U.S.-India relations including Washington's decision to reduce tariffs on Indian goods after New Delhi agreed to halt Russian oil imports, signaling that India's strategic alignment is shifting meaningfully toward the Western sanctions framework. Iran's National Iranian Oil Company denied any connection to the three vessels.

The action represents a dramatic reversal for India, which has been one of the largest buyers of discounted Russian and Iranian crude since Western sanctions began following the 2022 Ukraine invasion. By seizing U.S.-sanctioned vessels, New Delhi is effectively enforcing American sanctions law in its own waters—a step that would have been inconceivable 18 months ago and that will significantly complicate Iranian oil export logistics in the Indian Ocean region.

### 3. Tarique Rahman Sworn In as Bangladesh's New Prime Minister After BNP Landslide
*Feb 17*

> Tarique Rahman was sworn in as Bangladesh's new Prime Minister, completing the country's post-Hasina political transition as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party coalition secured a two-thirds parliamentary majority in last week's landmark elections—marking the end of Awami League dominance and Bangladesh's first male prime minister in 36 years.

Tarique Rahman was sworn in as Bangladesh's new Prime Minister in a televised ceremony administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin outside the parliament building in Dhaka, becoming the country's first male prime minister in 36 years. Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party coalition won more than a two-thirds majority in last week's elections, securing 212 seats versus 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, in the first elections since the 2024 student-led uprising that ousted Sheikh Hasina. Rahman, who is the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and returned to Bangladesh after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London shortly before his mother's death, formed a 49-member cabinet including 25 ministers and 24 state ministers.

The swearing-in marks a historic political transition for Bangladesh and the end of the Awami League's long dominance of Bangladeshi politics, which stretched nearly uninterrupted for 15 years under Hasina's increasingly authoritarian rule. Rahman faces significant governance challenges including managing relations with an Islamist opposition that has become the country's main opposition bloc for the first time in history, restoring democratic institutions, and navigating a complex regional security environment involving India, China, and Myanmar.

Bangladesh's transition is being closely watched as a test case for democratic restoration following a populist uprising—and as a potential model or cautionary tale for other countries where street protests have toppled long-entrenched governments. Relations with neighboring India, which was a close Hasina ally, will be an early diplomatic priority for the new government, as New Delhi has expressed concern about the rise of Islamist political forces in a country it considers a critical buffer state.

### 4. North Korea Opens Pyongyang Housing District for Families of Soldiers Killed Fighting in Ukraine
*Feb 16-17*

> Kim Jong Un attended the completion ceremony for a new Pyongyang housing district built specifically for the families of North Korean troops killed fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine—the first official public acknowledgment that North Korean soldiers have been dying in the conflict, as South Korean intelligence estimates 6,000 troops have been killed or wounded.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended the completion ceremony for Saeppyol Street, a new housing district in Pyongyang built specifically for the families of North Korean troops killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Kim walked through the street with his daughter Kim Ju-ae, pledging to honor the "young martyrs" who "sacrificed all to their motherland"—the first official public acknowledgment that North Korean troops have been dying in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. South Korea's National Intelligence Service had previously estimated approximately 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded in their deployment to Russian frontlines.

The housing project represents the Kim regime's attempt to manage domestic perception of military casualties while cementing its strategic alliance with Moscow, which analysts say is providing North Korea with advanced weapons technology and military experience in exchange for troops and ammunition. The gesture implicitly confirms troop deployments and deaths without requiring a formal diplomatic admission, allowing Pyongyang to simultaneously deny participation in the conflict through official channels while honoring casualties domestically.

North Korea's participation in the Ukraine war, long denied by Pyongyang, is increasingly difficult to conceal as casualty figures mount and South Korean and Western intelligence agencies track deployments in real time. The housing gesture signals that Kim is now comfortable allowing limited domestic acknowledgment of the military partnership's human costs, suggesting the alliance with Russia has become a foundational pillar of North Korean foreign policy rather than a deniable covert arrangement.

### 5. US Releases New Intelligence Alleging Secret Chinese Nuclear Test in 2020
*Feb 17*

> The U.S. State Department publicly released fresh intelligence alleging China conducted a covert low-yield nuclear test at the Lop Nur site in June 2020, detected via a 2.75-magnitude seismic event 450 miles away—a disclosure timed to build a case for U.S. nuclear testing resumption as global arms control collapses.

The U.S. State Department publicly released fresh intelligence alleging China conducted a covert low-yield nuclear weapons test in June 2020 at its Lop Nur test site in remote Xinjiang province. Assistant Secretary for Arms Control and Nonproliferation Christopher Yeaw stated that a 2.75-magnitude seismic event detected by a Kazakh monitoring station approximately 450 miles away was "very little possibility" anything other than "a singular explosion." The disclosure comes as nuclear arms control collapses globally—the New START Treaty between the U.S. and Russia expired in February 2026 with no replacement—and President Trump has suggested the U.S. may resume nuclear testing "on an equal basis" with other countries.

Independent experts at the Norwegian NORSAR monitoring organization acknowledged the seismic wave ratios were "consistent with an explosion" but did not immediately confirm the U.S. assessment. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which operates a global monitoring network, has not independently confirmed the allegation. Beijing has not publicly responded to the specific charge, and China has consistently denied conducting any nuclear tests after 1996 when it signed the CTBT.

If confirmed, the alleged test would represent China's first nuclear explosion since 1996 and a major violation of international non-proliferation norms. The disclosure appears timed to build a public case for the U.S. resuming nuclear testing and to pressure China in broader nuclear negotiations at a moment when the global arms control architecture is in unprecedented disarray. Arms control advocates warn that public allegations without definitive evidence could accelerate a nuclear testing arms race, while administration officials argue that unilateral U.S. restraint in testing while adversaries potentially test in secret is strategically untenable.

### 6. Israel Issues 60-Day Hamas Disarmament Ultimatum; Hamas Immediately Rejects It
*Feb 17*

> Israeli Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs warned Hamas it has 60 days to surrender all weapons or Israel will resume full combat operations in Gaza—an ultimatum Hamas immediately rejected as "merely threats with no basis," setting up a potential confrontation point around mid-April 2026 that could shatter the fragile Gaza ceasefire.

Israeli Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs publicly warned Hamas it has 60 days to surrender all weapons—including small arms and AK-47 rifles—or Israel's military will "complete its mission" in Gaza by resuming combat operations. Fuchs stated the 60-day clock may begin with the February 19 inaugural meeting of Trump's Board of Peace in Washington, and framed the ultimatum as aligning with U.S. demands. The announcement represents a dramatic escalation in Israeli ceasefire conditions, going far beyond previous demands and essentially requiring Hamas to dismantle itself as a military organization.

Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi told Al Jazeera he had no knowledge of any formal demand and called Israeli statements "merely threats with no basis in the ongoing negotiations," flatly rejecting any disarmament as a condition. Hamas has consistently maintained that it will not disarm as long as Palestinian territory remains under Israeli military occupation, a position the organization views as existential. The confrontation places Hamas between the existential choice of surrendering its military capacity or triggering a return to full-scale warfare that destroyed much of Gaza's infrastructure in 2023-2024.

The 60-day ultimatum effectively sets up a confrontation point around mid-April 2026 that could determine whether the ceasefire holds or collapses. Arab mediators Qatar and Egypt, who brokered the ceasefire, have not publicly commented on the Israeli ultimatum, and it is unclear whether the Trump administration endorsed the demand or was informed before it was announced. The Board of Peace's February 19 inaugural meeting will be watched closely to see whether the U.S. distances itself from the ultimatum or backs Israel's position, as the answer will significantly affect Arab state participation in Gaza reconstruction efforts.

### 7. Kosovo Marks 18th Independence Anniversary with Mass March Against War Crimes Trials
*Feb 17*

> Thousands of Kosovo Albanians marched through snow-covered Pristina on the 18th anniversary of independence to oppose ongoing war crimes trials at a Netherlands-based Special Tribunal targeting former Kosovo Liberation Army commanders, as Prime Minister Kurti defended the KLA's "just struggle" and Serbia simultaneously warned of security threats from a growing Kosovo-Albania-Croatia military alliance.

Thousands of Kosovo Albanians marched through the snow-covered capital Pristina on the 18th anniversary of Kosovo's February 17, 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia, with demonstrations focused not on celebration but on opposition to ongoing war crimes trials at a Netherlands-based Special Tribunal targeting former Kosovo Liberation Army commanders. Protesters wrapped in red-and-black Albanian flags called for charges against former President and KLA leader Hashim Thaci and three others to be dropped, with Prime Minister Albin Kurti addressing the crowd and defending the KLA war as "a just struggle of an occupied and oppressed people under apartheid." The mass demonstrations come weeks after Kurti's government was newly sworn in following a year-long political deadlock, giving the anniversary additional political weight.

The war crimes proceedings at The Hague represent a major source of domestic political tension in Kosovo, where KLA veterans are widely viewed as liberation heroes rather than war criminals, and where the prosecutions are seen by many as a foreign imposition that delegitimizes the founding narrative of the Kosovar state. International legal observers maintain that accountability for wartime atrocities—including allegations of organ trafficking and summary executions of Serb prisoners—is essential for long-term regional reconciliation, a position that enjoys little domestic political support in Kosovo.

Belgrade simultaneously held protests marking the anniversary from the Serbian perspective, with President Vucic separately condemning the emerging military alliance between Kosovo, Albania, and Croatia as "the biggest threat to Serbia." The competing narratives on Kosovo's anniversary underscore the persistence of Western Balkan instability nearly two decades after independence, with the Serbia-Kosovo dispute remaining unresolved and both countries pursuing incompatible geopolitical visions—Serbia toward Russia and China, Kosovo toward EU and NATO membership.

### 8. Venezuela's Delcy Rodriguez Declares Maduro Still "Legitimate President" as Power Transition Remains Murky
*Feb 17*

> Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez told NBC News that Maduro remains "the legitimate president" despite being held in U.S. custody in New York City awaiting trial—a statement that exposes the fragility of the post-capture political arrangement as Rodriguez simultaneously implements U.S.-demanded reforms while refusing to abandon Chavismo.

CNN published a major report from Caracas examining the deeply uncertain political situation in Venezuela 45 days after U.S. special forces captured Nicolas Maduro in a pre-dawn raid on January 3. Acting President Delcy Rodriguez gave a notable interview to NBC News in which she insisted Maduro remains "the legitimate president of Venezuela" despite being held in U.S. custody in New York City awaiting trial—a statement that signals the fragility of the U.S.-backed transition arrangement and the internal contradictions of the acting government's position. Rodriguez has simultaneously passed legislation granting foreign oil companies greater operating rights and freed hundreds of political prisoners while refusing to formally renounce Chavismo or declare the transition permanent.

The situation is one of the most unusual geopolitical arrangements in the Western Hemisphere: a U.S.-backed quasi-transition government that refuses to characterize the U.S. capture of an elected head of state as a coup while simultaneously cooperating with Washington on oil policy. Analysis from Colombia One noted that Rodriguez "still holds power" through a careful balancing act between satisfying U.S. economic demands and maintaining the loyalty of Chavista institutions, the military, and the ruling party, with no elections announced and Venezuela operating under an ambiguous interim arrangement.

The outcome remains deeply uncertain. If Rodriguez moves too aggressively toward U.S. demands, she risks losing the loyalty of the military and Chavista base that sustain her government. If she fails to deliver sufficient cooperation on oil production, sanctions relief, and political reforms, Washington may escalate pressure or withdraw support for the current arrangement. The absence of a clear electoral timeline and the unresolved legal status of Maduro—who continues to insist through his lawyers that his detention is illegal—make a stable long-term transition increasingly difficult to envision.

### 9. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kallas Fires Back at US "Civilizational Erasure" Claim
*Feb 17*

> EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas delivered a sharp rebuttal to the Trump administration's characterization of Europe as facing "civilizational erasure," declaring that "woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure" and condemning "European-bashing" from Washington as the transatlantic relationship navigates its most turbulent period in decades.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas delivered a sharp rebuttal to the Trump administration's characterization of Europe as facing "civilizational erasure"—a phrase drawn from the U.S. National Security Strategy released in December 2025. Speaking in post-Munich Security Conference statements covered through February 17, Kallas declared: "Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure," adding that "people still want to join the EU's club, including non-Europeans." Kallas condemned what she called "European-bashing" from Washington and argued that Europe continues to lead on human rights and democratic values in ways that generate genuine global prosperity.

The pushback reflects a broader transatlantic tension as European governments attempt to respond to the Trump administration's rhetorical attacks on European governance models while simultaneously seeking to preserve NATO unity and avoid economic confrontation over tariffs. Secretary of State Rubio struck a somewhat less confrontational tone at Munich than Vice President Vance did in 2025, pledging a "revitalized" transatlantic alliance, but the administration has maintained consistent pressure on European migration, trade, and climate policies that European leaders view as attacks on their democratic legitimacy.

The "civilizational erasure" language from the U.S. NSC document has become a major flashpoint in U.S.-Europe relations, with European officials viewing it as a deliberate effort by administration ideologues to delegitimize European social democracy and provide rhetorical cover for American disengagement from multilateral institutions. For Kallas, who served as Estonia's Prime Minister before taking the EU foreign policy role and has been one of Europe's most consistent voices on Russian aggression, the pushback carries particular weight: she is simultaneously defending European values from American skepticism while calling for Europe to spend more on defense and take greater responsibility for its own security.

### 10. Trump's Board of Peace Prepares Inaugural Gaza Meeting as Hamas Ultimatum Hangs Over Proceedings
*Feb 17-18*

> With its inaugural meeting set for February 19, Trump's Board of Peace faces a dramatically complicated agenda following Israel's simultaneous 60-day Hamas disarmament ultimatum—as member states have pledged $5 billion toward reconstruction against estimated total costs of $70 billion, covering less than 8% of Gaza's rebuilding needs.

With its first formal meeting scheduled for February 19 in Washington, Trump's Board of Peace—a 27-member body chaired by Trump and authorized by the UN Security Council to oversee Gaza ceasefire implementation and reconstruction—faces a dramatically complicated inaugural agenda following Israel's simultaneous 60-day Hamas disarmament ultimatum. Member states have already pledged more than $5 billion toward Gaza reconstruction, but the UN, World Bank, and EU estimate total reconstruction costs at $70 billion, meaning current pledges cover less than 8% of needs. Haaretz reported on February 17 that the Board's ambitions remain "soaring" but the reconstruction reality is "a distant dream" given the gap between pledges and requirements, ongoing hostage negotiations, and the Hamas disarmament confrontation.

The Board's membership includes a mix of Arab Gulf states, European powers, and regional stakeholders, each with different visions for Gaza's post-war governance and reconstruction priorities. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have indicated willingness to provide significant reconstruction funding but have conditioned larger commitments on a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood—a condition that clashes directly with the current Israeli government's firm opposition to any Palestinian state. European members are focused on ensuring reconstruction funds flow through transparent governance structures that exclude Hamas, while Hamas insists on participation in any future governance arrangements.

The inaugural meeting will test whether the Board can serve as a genuine multilateral framework or becomes a forum for competing U.S., Israeli, Arab, and European visions for Gaza's post-war governance. The Israel-issued 60-day disarmament ultimatum, if maintained, creates a hard deadline that could force the Board to take sides on the central question of whether Hamas must disarm before reconstruction begins, or whether reconstruction proceeds in parallel with political negotiations about Gaza's future—a question that has no consensus answer among Board members.

### 1. Palo Alto Networks Shares Fall 7% After-Hours as Billing Growth Disappoints Despite Q2 Revenue Beat
*Feb 17*

> Palo Alto Networks posted Q2 fiscal 2026 revenue of $2.26 billion (up 15% year-over-year), beating the $2.23 billion consensus, but shares fell approximately 7% after-hours after remaining performance obligations growth missed expectations—raising concerns about the durability of the company's "platformization" strategy in a competitive AI cybersecurity landscape.

Palo Alto Networks reported second-quarter fiscal 2026 results that beat headline revenue estimates but disappointed investors with a key growth metric, sending shares down approximately 7% in after-hours trading on February 17. Revenue of $2.26 billion exceeded the $2.23 billion consensus by a narrow margin and grew 15% year-over-year, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 came in ahead of forecasts. However, remaining performance obligations—the company's forward revenue backlog and a critical indicator of future contracted growth—grew at a slower rate than analysts anticipated, triggering concerns that the company's aggressive "platformization" strategy is encountering friction.

The RPO miss is significant because Palo Alto's bull case rests on convincing enterprise security teams to consolidate disparate point security tools onto its integrated platform, a pitch that requires large multi-year contract commitments. Slower RPO growth suggests either that platformization conversions are taking longer than projected or that enterprise buyers are pausing commitments amid broader budget uncertainty. The results also arrive against an increasingly competitive cybersecurity landscape where AI-powered security tools from cloud hyperscalers threaten to commoditize parts of the traditional enterprise security stack.

The PANW reaction is part of a broader pattern in February 2026 where technology companies face heightened punishment for any guidance shortfall, as investors grown accustomed to multiple expansion during the AI boom era reassess forward earnings assumptions. Full-year fiscal 2026 guidance was updated to reflect the Q3 shortfall, though management reiterated confidence in the long-term platformization thesis. The stock's after-hours move erases several weeks of gains and returns shares to levels last seen before the company's strong Q1 report in November 2025.

### 2. Empire State Manufacturing Index Rises to 7.1 in February, Beating Forecasts Amid Trade Uncertainty
*Feb 18*

> The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Empire State Manufacturing Index rose to 7.1 in February 2026, exceeding the forecast of 6, with employment improving and input price inflation accelerating sharply—as tariff pass-through costs begin to widen the gap between what manufacturers pay for inputs and what they can charge customers.

New York State manufacturing activity continued to expand modestly in February 2026, with the Empire State Manufacturing Index registering 7.1, above the Wall Street consensus of 6 and signaling an eighth consecutive month of positive territory for the regional barometer, though the pace eased slightly from January's 7.7 reading. The positive overall reading masks significant internal divergences: the new orders sub-index slipped to 5.8 from 6.6, and the shipments component fell sharply to -1 from 16.3, suggesting near-term delivery activity is cooling even as the broader demand environment holds up. Employment turned a corner, rising to 4 from -9 in January, and the average workweek improved to 2.1 from -5.4, suggesting factories are adding hours and workers despite broader uncertainty.

The most notable development in the February survey was the sharp acceleration in price pressures. The input prices paid sub-index jumped to 49.1 from 42.8, while the prices received index surged to 22.2 from 14.4—the largest monthly jump in selling price inflation in over a year. The widening gap between input costs and selling prices points to margin compression in the manufacturing sector, consistent with tariff pass-through dynamics as businesses absorb higher import costs on components and raw materials before being able to fully raise end prices. The data reinforces Federal Reserve concerns that supply-side inflation from trade policy could prove stickier than demand-driven price pressures.

Forward-looking expectations remained positive, with firms expecting conditions to continue improving over the next six months, employment growth anticipated to continue, and capital expenditure plans holding steady. However, the survey was taken against a backdrop of evolving U.S.-Iran relations and ongoing tariff uncertainty, meaning actual activity in coming months could diverge materially depending on policy developments and whether input price pressures intensify further as new tariff tranches take effect.

### 3. NAHB Housing Market Index Falls to 36 in February, Below Expectations, as Builder Confidence Weakens
*Feb 18*

> The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell to 36 in February 2026, missing the forecast of 38, with current sales at 41, buyer traffic at 22, and six-month sales expectations declining to 46 from 49—reflecting a fourth consecutive month of depressed builder sentiment as elevated mortgage rates and tariff-driven cost increases combine to suppress the spring selling season outlook.

Builder confidence in the U.S. housing market weakened further in February 2026, with the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index slipping to 36 from 37 in January, below the 38 consensus estimate and remaining deeply in negative territory below the neutral 50 threshold. The current single-family sales component held at 41, prospective buyer traffic declined to 22 from 23, and the forward-looking six-month sales expectations component dropped to 46 from 49, signaling that builders anticipate continued softness heading into the spring selling season. The reading marks the fourth consecutive month of depressed builder sentiment as structural affordability barriers and policy uncertainty keep prospective buyers sidelined.

The primary driver of persistent builder pessimism is the combination of still-elevated mortgage rates near 6% and rising construction input costs from tariffs on Canadian lumber, Chinese building materials, and steel and aluminum imports. Tariff-driven cost increases are estimated to add $9,200 to the average price of a new single-family home according to NAHB analysis, directly eroding the affordability improvements that declining mortgage rates were meant to provide. Builders face a difficult pricing dilemma: passing through higher construction costs risks pricing out already-stretched buyers, while absorbing costs threatens already-thin margins in a market where speculative inventory has accumulated.

Regional breakdowns showed continued weakness across all four major census regions, with the South and Midwest showing the sharpest monthly declines. The weakening NAHB index, coming alongside January housing starts and building permits data released the same day, paints a picture of a housing construction sector navigating headwinds from multiple directions simultaneously. Real estate economists note that a sustained recovery in builder confidence will likely require either a meaningful decline in mortgage rates toward 5.5% or a significant easing of materials cost pressures—neither of which appears imminent given current Federal Reserve rate policy and the tariff environment.

### 4. Oil Prices Drop Over 4% as US and Iran Reach "General Agreement" on Nuclear Deal Framework
*Feb 17-18*

> U.S. crude fell to $62.33 per barrel and Brent dropped to $67.42 after Iran announced a "general agreement" with the U.S. on guiding principles during Geneva talks, raising expectations that sanctions relief could unlock an estimated 3 million barrels per day of additional Iranian supply and complicating OPEC+ production management.

Oil prices suffered their sharpest single-session decline in weeks on February 17-18, 2026, as Iran announced reaching a "general agreement" with the United States on guiding principles during diplomatic talks in Geneva, raising expectations that a formal nuclear deal could lift Iranian oil sanctions and add significant additional supply to already-adequately-supplied global markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled down $2.87 per barrel at $62.33, while global benchmark Brent crude fell $1.23 to $67.42, as the diplomatic breakthrough reduced the geopolitical risk premium that had supported oil prices throughout January when Trump administration rhetoric toward Iran escalated sharply.

The diplomatic development is significant because Iran holds an estimated 3 million barrels per day of potential production capacity currently constrained by U.S. sanctions, representing roughly 3% of global daily consumption. Any meaningful sanctions relief could quickly translate into increased Iranian exports to China and other Asian buyers, adding to a global market where OPEC+ has been carefully managing production cuts to support price floors. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ members now face a complex calculus: whether to maintain or extend production discipline to offset potential Iranian supply additions, or to allow prices to fall and preserve market share against a returning Iran.

Adding complexity to the diplomatic picture, Iran's Revolutionary Guard conducted war games in the Strait of Hormuz even as diplomatic talks progressed in Geneva, suspending commercial traffic through the critical chokepoint for several hours. Oil traders noted that even with a "general agreement" on principles, translating those principles into a formal deal with verification mechanisms, sanctions removal timelines, and Congressional support on both sides could take months, keeping the near-term supply picture uncertain. The energy price move has immediate implications for inflation forecasts, with declining oil prices potentially providing modest relief to consumers and easing pressure on the Federal Reserve.

### 5. Federal Reserve January Meeting Minutes Reveal Rate Cut Patience Amid Tariff Inflation Concerns
*Feb 18*

> The Federal Reserve released minutes from the January 27–28, 2026 FOMC meeting showing officials unanimously voted to hold the federal funds rate at 3.5%–3.75% while debating whether tariff-driven inflation represents a transitory shock or a persistent risk—with markets pricing only a 10% probability of a March cut following the release.

The Federal Reserve released the minutes of its January 27-28, 2026 Federal Open Market Committee meeting on February 18, providing the clearest window yet into policymakers' thinking as the Fed navigated the tension between modestly cooling inflation and the uncertain inflationary impact of the most aggressive tariff regime since 1946. The minutes confirmed that the Committee unanimously voted to hold the federal funds rate in the 3.5%-3.75% target range, pausing the easing cycle that began in late 2025 after three consecutive rate cuts totaling 75 basis points. Officials described the economy as expanding at a solid pace with stable employment conditions, but flagged elevated uncertainty from trade policy as a key risk factor requiring continued monitoring before additional accommodation would be appropriate.

A central theme in the minutes was the debate over tariff-driven inflation and whether it should be treated as a transitory shock to the price level or a more persistent inflation risk requiring a hawkish policy response. Several officials expressed concern that tariff pass-through to consumer prices, which has been gradual through early 2026, could accelerate as businesses exhaust their ability to absorb costs and begin raising retail prices. Fed Chair Powell had previously indicated he expects a one-time price level adjustment to work through the economy by mid-2026, but the minutes reveal internal disagreement about the timing and magnitude of this adjustment and its implications for the long-run inflation trajectory.

Markets received the minutes with little surprise, as the CME FedWatch tool was already pricing approximately 90% probability that the Fed holds rates again at the March 2026 meeting. The focus for Fed watchers now shifts to Friday's January Personal Consumption Expenditures price index—the Fed's preferred inflation gauge—and next week's Walmart earnings call, which will provide a retail-level consumer health check. The minutes signal the Fed is content to wait for additional data rather than risk cutting prematurely into a tariff-inflationary environment, a posture that may extend the rate pause into the second quarter of 2026 if upcoming inflation readings surprise to the upside.

### 6. Analog Devices Beats Q1 Fiscal 2026 Estimates with $3.08 Billion Revenue as Industrial Cycle Rebounds
*Feb 18*

> Analog Devices reported Q1 fiscal 2026 EPS of $2.26, beating the $2.22 estimate, with revenue of $3.08 billion exceeding the $3.02 billion consensus, driven by recovering industrial and automotive semiconductor demand as the prolonged inventory correction that depressed analog chip orders for 18 months reaches its end.

Analog Devices delivered a clean beat in its fiscal first quarter 2026 earnings released before the market open on February 18, reporting earnings per share of $2.26 on a $2.22 consensus estimate and revenue of $3.08 billion versus the $3.02 billion Wall Street forecast. The chipmaker, which specializes in mixed-signal semiconductors for industrial automation, automotive systems, and communications infrastructure, benefited from recovering end-market demand as the prolonged inventory correction that depressed analog chip orders throughout 2024 and early 2025 reached its end. Industrial customers—ADI's largest revenue segment representing nearly half of total sales—began replenishing inventory in earnest, while automotive demand held steady despite broader automotive production headwinds in Europe.

The results position Analog Devices as a beneficiary of the divergence within the broader semiconductor sector: while AI-driven logic chips and memory have seen explosive demand cycles tied to data center buildout, analog chips serving industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics have been recovering from a deeper, longer inventory trough that suppressed results for over 18 months. ADI's gross margins remained healthy above 68%, reflecting the company's pricing power in differentiated signal chain products and its manufacturing strategy utilizing its own internal fabs supplemented by TSMC for more advanced nodes. CEO Vincent Roche highlighted continued design win momentum across factory automation, medical devices, and aerospace and defense as evidence of structural demand durability beyond the cyclical recovery.

Forward guidance for the second fiscal quarter was provided at $3.1 billion in revenue at the midpoint, approximately 4.4% above the analyst consensus, confirming that the industrial recovery is genuine and not simply a one-quarter inventory restocking blip. The strong guidance reinforced sector confidence in the analog semiconductor recovery narrative and provided a positive contrast to the AI software sector's turbulence in recent weeks. Shares responded positively in early trading as investors welcomed confirmation that non-AI semiconductor markets are stabilizing and improving after an extended period of weakness.

### 7. DoorDash Reports Q4 2025 Earnings as Delivery Giant Faces AI Disruption and Grocery Expansion Test
*Feb 18*

> DoorDash released Q4 2025 results after market close, with analysts expecting EPS of $0.58 and revenue of $3.98 billion, as investors scrutinize the company's grocery and retail delivery expansion for evidence it can offset slowing restaurant delivery growth—against a stock that has fallen nearly 25% over the past 52 weeks amid broader tech sector concerns.

DoorDash's fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings report was released after the close of U.S. financial markets on February 18, 2026, serving as a pivotal test of whether the delivery giant's aggressive expansion into grocery, retail, and international markets can offset slowing growth in its core restaurant delivery business. Analysts projected earnings of $0.58 per share and revenue of $3.984 billion for Q4, implying solid growth from Q3 levels but against the context of a stock that has fallen nearly 25% over the past 52 weeks, trading around $160 per share entering the reporting period. Investors focused on Gross Order Value—estimated at $29.2 billion for the quarter—and the trajectory of contribution margin, the key profitability metric that DoorDash management has guided toward sustained improvement.

The backdrop for DoorDash's earnings is complicated by AI disruption concerns that have roiled the broader technology sector throughout February 2026. While delivery platforms are less directly exposed to AI automation fears than software-as-a-service companies, DoorDash faces its own AI-related structural questions: autonomous delivery vehicles and robotic last-mile logistics threaten to commoditize the human courier model over a five-to-ten year horizon. The company's DashPass loyalty program, now estimated at 26 million members, provides recurring subscription revenue that helps stabilize its financial profile, but must demonstrate superior engagement and retention metrics to justify its cost structure.

The international expansion into European markets—particularly through the Wolt platform acquired in 2022—drew significant attention on the earnings call, as European operations have been the primary growth engine at a time when U.S. restaurant delivery market share gains are maturing. With over 99% of U.S. consumers now having access to at least one non-restaurant retailer on the platform including Home Depot, Walmart, and Petco, the success of the grocery and retail verticals represents the clearest path to DoorDash's next phase of total addressable market expansion beyond food delivery.

### 8. Kinross Gold Reports Q4 2025 Earnings as Gold Miners Benefit from Record Bullion Prices
*Feb 18*

> Kinross Gold released Q4 2025 results with analysts projecting EPS of $0.54 (up 170% year-over-year) and revenue of $1.87 billion (up 32.4%), reflecting surging gold prices that have driven record margins for major gold miners—with all-in sustaining costs around $1,300 per ounce against gold prices above $4,900, implying margins of approximately $3,600 per ounce.

Kinross Gold Corporation released its fourth-quarter 2025 and full-year financial results along with its 2026 operating guidance on February 18, 2026, in what analysts described as among the strongest annual reports in the gold miner's history. Wall Street consensus projected Q4 earnings per share of $0.54, representing a stunning 170% year-over-year increase driven almost entirely by the dramatic rise in gold prices throughout 2025 and into 2026, with revenues anticipated at $1.87 billion—a 32.4% increase from the prior-year quarter. The consensus EPS estimate had been revised upward by 38.3% over the past 30 days, a sign that analyst models were still catching up to the magnitude of gold's bull run and its impact on miner profitability.

The gold mining sector has been one of the standout performers in the 2026 market environment, as bullion prices have climbed dramatically from historical norms, creating powerful operating leverage for producers with fixed or semi-fixed cost structures. With gold trading above $4,900 per ounce in recent sessions and having reached record highs earlier in 2026, the spread between production costs and gold prices expanded to historically wide levels. Kinross's all-in sustaining costs are expected around $1,300 per ounce, implying margins of roughly $3,600 per ounce—a margin profile that supports exceptional cash flow generation and debt reduction.

Investors in gold miners have grown increasingly focused on capital return programs as free cash flow surges, and Kinross outlined its dividend policy and share buyback strategy for 2026 during the earnings call. The company operates mines in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Mauritania, providing geographic diversification that partially insulates results from single-jurisdiction political or operational disruptions. Full-year 2026 guidance showed production of approximately 2 million gold equivalent ounces, with cost guidance confirming that the exceptional margin environment of early 2026 is likely to persist through the year.

### 9. Figma Reports First Public Quarter After IPO with Q4 Revenue Expected at $293 Million
*Feb 18*

> Figma released Q4 and full year 2025 earnings as a newly public company, with analysts expecting revenue of $293 million (35% year-over-year growth) and full-year revenue of approximately $1.045 billion—crossing the $1 billion threshold for the first time—as the collaborative design software company navigates an AI-intensive competitive landscape after its abandoned $20 billion Adobe acquisition.

Figma, the collaborative design software company whose proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was abandoned in December 2023 following regulatory opposition, released its fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings after the U.S. market close on February 18, 2026, in one of the most closely watched early-stage public company earnings reports of the year. The company reported Q4 revenue between $292 million and $294 million, confirming approximately 35% year-over-year growth at the midpoint—a rate that validates Figma's continued strong competitive position in the design tools market despite intensifying competition from Adobe's AI-enhanced product suite and emerging AI-native design tools. The Q3 2025 earnings call had revealed that Figma crossed the $1 billion annual revenue run rate milestone, a landmark for its first full fiscal year as a public company.

Figma's earnings were scrutinized for several strategic data points beyond the headline revenue number. Customer count metrics—the company reported 540,000 paid teams entering Q4 after adding more than 90,000 in just two prior quarters—indicate whether enterprise adoption is accelerating or plateauing. Revenue per customer trajectory signals whether Figma can upsell its platform into new product lines including FigJam (collaborative whiteboarding), Figma AI (integrated generative design features), and its recently launched developer tools, all of which carry higher average selling prices than the core design subscription.

The broader AI disruption concern that has hammered software-as-a-service valuations throughout February 2026 creates a complex backdrop for Figma's market debut as a public reporting entity. Unlike pure SaaS companies whose core function can theoretically be automated by AI agents, Figma occupies a more defensible position as the collaborative workspace where AI-generated design outputs are reviewed, iterated, and approved by human designers and product teams. Management's commentary on AI's impact as an opportunity rather than a threat—and any guidance metrics around AI feature monetization—was closely watched by investors looking to distinguish AI-resilient software from those vulnerable to displacement.

### 10. Walmart Q4 FY2026 Earnings Set for February 19 as $1 Trillion Retailer Tests Consumer Health
*Feb 17-18*

> Walmart will report Q4 fiscal 2026 earnings before market open on February 19, with analysts projecting revenue of $188.6–$190 billion (6% growth) and EPS of $0.73—as investors look for guidance on tariff cost absorption, e-commerce profitability, and the health of the American consumer following the record 43-day federal government shutdown and persistent inflation pressures.

Walmart is positioned to deliver one of the most consequential quarterly earnings reports of the February 2026 season when it releases fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results before the market open on February 19, 2026. Analysts project revenue between $188.6 billion and $190 billion, representing approximately 6% year-over-year growth, with adjusted EPS consensus at $0.73—roughly 10% above the $0.66 reported in Q4 FY2025—while UBS's more bullish forecast calls for EPS of $0.75-$0.80. U.S. comparable sales excluding fuel are expected to grow approximately 4.1%, driven by foot traffic gains across the full store network including Walmart's rapidly growing private brand portfolio and fresh food departments, which have been drawing higher-income households that traditionally shopped at premium grocers.

The central narrative around Walmart's Q4 report is its status as the definitive consumer health barometer following one of the most economically volatile periods in recent memory, which included a record 43-day federal government shutdown and escalating tariff-driven price pressures. The company's demographic capture story has become increasingly prominent: approximately 75% of Walmart's market share gains over the past year have come from households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000, a structural shift that reflects value-seeking behavior among middle and upper-middle class consumers responding to persistent inflation and economic uncertainty.

Tariff guidance will dominate the Q4 earnings call discussion, as Walmart imports a substantial portion of its general merchandise from China and other heavily tariffed countries. Analysts expect management to provide specific quantification of tariff cost impact for fiscal 2027 and detail their mitigation strategy combining supplier negotiation, geographic diversification of sourcing, and selective private label substitution. Walmart's advertising revenue arm, Walmart Connect—which grew over 30% in recent periods and is now a multi-billion-dollar high-margin business—will also be scrutinized for evidence that the company's platform business model is maturing enough to provide structural margin support even if merchandise gross margins compress under tariff pressure.
