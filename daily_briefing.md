### 1. Thailand Votes in Snap Election as Political Crisis Deepens with Cambodia Border Tensions
*Feb 8*

> Thailand's snap general elections are underway on February 8, with 53 million eligible voters deciding the composition of the House of Representatives and voting on whether to replace the 2017 constitution, as Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul's coalition collapse coincides with escalating border tensions with Cambodia.

Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai party, called for the dissolution of Parliament due to the inability to reach a consensus with the Prachachon party, his coalition partner, on constitutional reform. About 53 million people in the kingdom of 71 million are eligible to vote for the 500-seat House of Representatives through a mixed electoral system. Polling stations opened at 8am (01:00 GMT) and will close at 5pm (10:00 GMT), with vote counting beginning shortly after and results announced as tallies are completed.

A Suan Dusit University survey of 26,661 people between January 16-28 gave the progressive People's Party 36% support, with Pheu Thai at 22.1% and Bhumjaithai at 18.9%. The People's Party has been campaigning heavily before the election, with support stirring hope that the democratic future it promises may finally be within reach. The election represents a critical moment for Thai democracy, with voters weighing whether to break free from years of military-backed governance and constitutional constraints that have limited civilian political power.

The early election call reflects the worsening of the Thai political crisis, which coincides with increased tensions on the border with Cambodia. The Election Commission expects to know more than 90% of the unofficial vote count by around 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM local time. The official results will be announced on April 9, whereby the new House will then convene to elect a new prime minister and parliamentary speakers within 15 days, setting the stage for potential political transformation in Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.

### 2. Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council Dissolves After Two Years of Tumultuous Rule
*Feb 7*

> Haiti's presidential council stepped down on February 7 after almost two years of tumultuous rule, handing power to US-backed Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime as the country prepares for its first general elections in a decade amid rampant gang violence that has left thousands dead.

The Transitional Presidential Council handed power to Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime after almost two years of tumultuous governance marked by rampant gang violence, with the transfer of power taking place on Saturday under tight security. The Council was sworn in at the National Palace on April 25, 2024, to exercise the powers and duties of the president of Haiti either until an elected president is inaugurated or until February 7, 2026, whichever came first—making Saturday's dissolution the constitutional endpoint of its mandate.

The transitional period has been characterized by escalating security challenges, with powerful gangs controlling an estimated 80% of the capital Port-au-Prince and launching coordinated attacks on government institutions, police stations, and civilian neighborhoods. The council faced criticism for internal divisions, allegations of corruption, and its inability to restore basic security and services to Haiti's 11 million citizens. International observers have questioned whether the council's dissolution and handover to the prime minister represents genuine progress toward democratic governance or merely another chapter in Haiti's prolonged political instability.

Prime Minister Fils-Aime is expected to remain in power as the country prepares for the first general elections in a decade, though no firm date has been set due to security concerns and logistical challenges. The United States has maintained significant influence over Haiti's transitional arrangements, providing security assistance and diplomatic backing for the current leadership structure. The dissolution of the council marks a pivotal moment for Haiti, with the coming months likely to determine whether the country can chart a path toward stability and democratic renewal or faces further fragmentation and violence.

### 3. Jimmy Lai Faces Sentencing in Hong Kong on National Security Charges
*Feb 9*

> Hong Kong media tycoon and democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai will be sentenced on February 9 in a closely watched case, with the 78-year-old founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper facing potential life imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces.

Three High Court judges who oversaw Lai's high-profile trial are expected to hand down penalties on the 78-year-old defendant at 10am on Monday, February 9. Lai was found guilty in December 2025 of two charges of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces under a China-imposed national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material. The trial has been widely viewed as a test case for Hong Kong's national security legislation and the future of press freedom in the former British colony.

Global leaders, including United States President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have called for Lai's release, while rights groups say his trial is a death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong. Some countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have said the trial is politically motivated and demanded Lai's immediate release. The sentencing comes as part of a broader crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong following the massive pro-democracy protests of 2019-2020, with authorities using the national security law to prosecute activists, journalists, and opposition politicians.

The judges will also sentence six former senior executives of Lai's Apple Daily tabloid-style newspaper, three companies associated with the outlet, and two activists in addition to Lai. International human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings as a violation of fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong's Basic Law and international human rights conventions. The case has attracted unprecedented international attention, with observers noting that the outcome will signal how far Beijing is willing to go in reshaping Hong Kong's legal and political landscape to align with mainland Chinese governance models.

### 4. US and Russia Close to Handshake Deal to Observe Expired Nuclear Treaty
*Feb 5-8*

> The U.S. and Russia are closing in on an informal agreement to continue observing the expiring New START arms control treaty beyond its February 5 expiration, with negotiators agreeing to observe the spirit of the treaty through a "handshake" deal as the first time in more than half a century looms without binding limits on strategic nuclear arsenals.

The New START treaty officially expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time since the early 1970s that there will be no legally binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces without another agreement being under negotiation. While the U.S. and Russian negotiators agreed to observe the spirit of New START, the parties have not formally signed an agreement to that effect, with one U.S. official cautioning that the agreement would have to be "a handshake" deal because an extension is technically not permissible by law.

The treaty capped the US and Russia each at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers, and up to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. It also established detailed transparency and verification mechanisms, including data exchanges, notifications, and on-site inspections that provided critical insight into each nation's nuclear capabilities. Russia suspended the treaty in early 2023 over Washington's support for Ukraine, though Moscow said it would still observe agreed upon restrictions.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a "grave moment" as the final US-Russia nuclear arms treaty expired, noting that for the first time in more than half a century, the world faces a situation without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two countries that possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons, or more than 10,500 warheads combined. President Trump has suggested that if New START expires, a "better" agreement could be negotiated and said that China should be included, though Beijing has consistently argued that it will not join formal arms control negotiations while its arsenal remains far smaller than those of the US and Russia.

### 5. US Military Buildup in Middle East Reaches Largest Scale Since 2003 Iraq Invasion
*Jan-Feb 2026*

> The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and its strike group deployed to the Middle East on January 26 as part of the largest U.S. military buildup in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with Trump administration envoys signaling military resolve to Iran aboard the carrier on February 7.

The USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was deployed to the Middle East on January 26, 2026, with its strike group, including guided-missile destroyers, cruisers, support vessels, and surveillance aircraft. The USS Abraham Lincoln serves as a mobile airfield and the flagship vessel of the US Navy's Carrier Strike Group 3, an operational formation that includes several thousand personnel—likely between 6,000 and 7,000 sailors and marines. Middle East analysts say people close to President Trump believe he is likely to strike Iran, with discussions centered around the U.S. military buildup in the region being the largest since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

CENTCOM chief Admiral Brad Cooper, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, who are leading negotiations with Iran, boarded the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier on February 7 in an apparent signal of military resolve to Iran. The high-profile visit came as diplomatic talks between the U.S. and Iran continued in Oman regarding nuclear issues, with Iran's foreign minister describing the discussions as "a good start" while noting that decisions on further rounds of talks would be taken after consultation with Tehran.

On February 3, 2026, six IRGC Navy gunboats attempted to stop and seize a US tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, but the Stena Imperative tanker ignored their demands and continued toward the Arabian Sea under the escort of the USS McFaul (DDG 74). Moreover, a US F-35 fighter jet shot down an Iranian Shahed 139 drone approaching the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, marking a significant escalation in tensions. Concerns over potential military escalation have mounted, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warning that any confrontation could spark a wider regional war that could draw in multiple Middle Eastern nations and potentially trigger a global oil crisis.

### 6. Vietnam's Internal Military Document Reveals Preparations for Potential US War
*Feb 3*

> An internal Vietnamese military document issued by the Navy under the Ministry of Defense shows Vietnam's military was taking steps to prepare for a possible American "war of aggression" and considered the United States a "belligerent" power, despite having elevated relations with Washington to the highest diplomatic level just a year earlier.

The internal military document was issued by Vietnam's Navy under the Ministry of Defense on August 1, 2024, entitled "The 2nd US Invasion Plan (357/KH-BTL)," which was signed by Vice Admiral Tran Thanh Nghiem and certified by Rear Admiral Vu Van Nam. The document confirms a deep-seated fear of external forces fomenting an uprising against the Communist leadership in a so-called "color revolution," like the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, or the 1986 Yellow Revolution in the Philippines.

While the document states that "there is currently little risk of a war against Vietnam," it does note that "due to the U.S.'s belligerent nature, we need to be vigilant to prevent the U.S. and its allies from 'creating a pretext' to launch a war of aggression against our country." The disclosure highlights what analysts describe as a dual-track approach in Vietnam's foreign policy: outward diplomatic engagement alongside persistent internal suspicion. A year after Vietnam elevated its relations with Washington to the highest diplomatic level, the revelation of military planning documents targeting potential American military action underscores the complexity of U.S.-Vietnam relations.

The document's existence became public through reports in early February 2026, sparking debate among regional security analysts about the implications for U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia. Analysts note that Vietnam's Communist Party leadership maintains deep-rooted concerns about Western influence on its political system, even as it pursues economic and security cooperation with the United States as a counterweight to Chinese regional dominance. The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-Asian relations, with the Trump administration seeking to strengthen security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region while navigating complex historical legacies and ideological differences with communist-governed states.

### 7. Nigerian Gunmen Kill Three and Kidnap Catholic Priest in Kaduna State Attack
*Feb 7*

> Gunmen killed three villagers and abducted 11 people, including a Catholic priest, during a predawn attack in northwest Nigeria on February 7, marking the latest in a cycle of violence that has surged in the conflict-battered north of the country.

The incident occurred in Karku community of Kauru Local Government Area in the early hours of Saturday at about 3:20 am (WAT), at the priest's residence. The abducted priest is Rev. Fr. Nathaniel Asuwaye of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Karku. Three residents lost their lives in the attack, named as Mr. Jacob Dan'azumi, Mr. Maitala Kaura, and Alhaji Kusari. The assault was described as "an act of invasion by a group of terrorists" by Catholic officials and local authorities.

The attack is the latest in a cycle of violence that has surged in the conflict-battered north of Nigeria, where armed groups—including bandits, kidnappers, and jihadist militants—operate across multiple states with varying degrees of organization and ideological motivation. Northwest Nigeria has experienced a dramatic increase in kidnappings for ransom over the past several years, with criminal gangs targeting schools, churches, travelers, and individual households. The region's security crisis has been compounded by ethnic tensions, competition over scarce resources, and the proliferation of small arms.

Nigeria's security forces have struggled to contain the violence despite military operations and the designation of bandit groups as terrorists. Religious leaders have called for greater government action to protect vulnerable communities, with Catholic bishops expressing particular concern about attacks targeting clergy and worshippers. The kidnapping of priests has become increasingly common in Nigeria's northwest and north-central regions, with criminal groups viewing clergy as valuable targets for ransom demands, knowing that religious communities and international Catholic organizations may be willing to pay for their release.

### 8. Amsterdam and Florence Ban Fossil Fuel Advertising in Public Spaces
*Jan-Feb 2026*

> Amsterdam and Florence became the latest cities to ban fossil fuel advertising in public spaces, with Amsterdam's city council passing a legally binding ban on January 22 that will prohibit advertising for air travel, cruises, petrol-powered cars, and meat products starting May 1, 2026, making it the first capital in the world to enact such comprehensive restrictions through local law.

Amsterdam city council approved a bid by green political party GroenLinks and animal welfare party Partij voor de Dieren to ban fossil fuel and meat adverts in public spaces and on the city's public transport network. The measure will prohibit advertising for air travel, cruises, and petrol-powered cars, with the official start date of the regulation set for May 1, 2026. Companies that go against the new law could face fines of between €20,000 and €100,000, with repeat offenders paying double the amount.

Florence followed suit in early February 2026, becoming the first Italian city to adopt a ban on fossil fuel advertising in public spaces in an 18-3 vote. A motion passed in Florence means it will soon become the first Italian city to ban fossil fuel advertising in public spaces, targeting ads for flights, cruises, fossil energy contracts, and cars. Both cities are part of a broader global trend, as over 50 cities, mostly European, have either restricted such ads in specific areas or tabled motions to introduce formal limitations.

Several Dutch municipalities, Stockholm, Edinburgh, and Sydney have banned fossil fuel advertising altogether, representing a growing movement among urban governments to use advertising regulations as a climate policy tool. Environmental advocates argue that fossil fuel advertising normalizes high-carbon lifestyles and undermines efforts to meet Paris Agreement climate targets, while industry groups contend that advertising bans represent government overreach and may violate commercial free speech protections. The Amsterdam and Florence decisions are likely to inspire similar efforts in other European cities, potentially creating a patchwork of local advertising restrictions that could complicate marketing campaigns for airlines, automotive companies, and energy providers across the continent.

### 9. Munich Security Conference Set to Address Transatlantic Divisions and Global Security
*Feb 13-15*

> The 62nd Munich Security Conference will take place from February 13 to 15, 2026, assembling more than 450 senior decision-makers to debate pressing issues of international security policy at a fundamental inflection point, with longstanding alliances called into question and mounting instability across the globe.

During its main conference in February, the MSC assembles more than 450 senior decision-makers as well as thought leaders from around the world, including heads of state, ministers, leading personalities of international and non-governmental organizations, high-ranking representatives from business, the media, academia, and civil society to debate pressing issues of international security policy. Topics addressed at the MSC 2026 will include European security and defense, the future of the transatlantic relationship, the revitalization of multilateralism, competing visions of the global order, regional conflicts, and the security implications of technological advances.

With longstanding alliances called into question, the rules-based international order eroding, and mounting instability and escalating conflicts across the globe, this year's Munich Security Conference takes place at a fundamental inflection point. The 2026 edition is expected to bring back echoes of 2025, when US Vice President JD Vance signaled the breakdown of the transatlantic consensus on the war in Ukraine and the conceptual abyss that separates the new Trump administration from European allies.

The MSC kick-off will take place on February 9, 2026, and the next Munich Security Report will be released ahead of the 62nd Munich Security Conference on the same day. European leaders are expected to use the forum to discuss strategies for managing relations with the Trump administration, coordinating responses to Russian aggression, addressing the challenges posed by China's rise, and strengthening European defense capabilities. The conference comes at a moment when traditional assumptions about American security commitments to Europe are being questioned, forcing European nations to contemplate greater strategic autonomy while navigating complex dependencies on U.S. military power and intelligence capabilities.

### 10. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Halts Trading in China-Linked Ramp-and-Dump Stocks
*Feb 2026*

> The SEC has halted trading in suspected ramp-and-dump stocks with potential China links as SEC Chairman Paul Atkins launches a crackdown to protect U.S. investors, with the agency announcing enforcement actions against nearly a dozen Chinese companies showing "indications of manipulative behavior."

The Securities and Exchange Commission has announced enforcement actions against stocks it suspects are involved in "pump-and-dump" or "ramp-and-dump" schemes tied to foreign-based companies, including entities with operations in China. Atkins noted that the problematic companies are "small, kind of penny stocks on Nasdaq," particularly East Asian and China-related companies. The SEC has identified nearly a dozen Chinese companies that showed "indications of manipulative behavior" and involvement with "ramp-and-dump" schemes.

Atkins stated: "We have really good folks who are monitoring the markets and looking at the data that we collect … and then we're taking steps to shut down the trading before investors can get hurt." The action represents part of Atkins' broader effort to tighten SEC scrutiny of Chinese firms trading on U.S. exchanges, with the chairman saying the agency is reassessing exemptions for foreign private issuers, particularly Chinese firms operating in China but incorporated offshore.

The crackdown comes amid growing bipartisan pressure in Washington to address concerns about Chinese companies accessing U.S. capital markets without meeting the same disclosure and audit requirements as domestic firms. Congressional leaders have been pushing for stricter enforcement of existing rules and consideration of legislation that would mandate delisting of Chinese firms that fail to comply with U.S. auditing standards. The SEC's actions signal a shift toward more aggressive oversight of foreign issuers, particularly those from jurisdictions where regulatory cooperation has been limited or where national security concerns about financial flows have been raised by intelligence agencies.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Software Stocks Plummet in "Worst Selloff in 25 Years" as AI Disruption Fears Intensify
*Feb 3-8*

> Salesforce and ServiceNow have both lost about a quarter of their value in 2026 as fears mount that AI tools from companies like Anthropic will disrupt traditional enterprise software, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling it "the worst structural sell-off in software I've ever seen in 25 years."

Salesforce and ServiceNow tumbled nearly 7% in a single session this week, pushing ServiceNow's year-to-date losses to 28% and Salesforce's 2026 decline to almost 26%. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund has plummeted about 20% so far in 2026, including a 6.5% drop during the first week of February. "I could tell you in 25 years, this structural sell-off in software is unlike anything I've ever seen," according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, highlighting the unprecedented nature of the sector's decline.

The most important reason for the sell-off is the ongoing fear that these companies will be disrupted by AI tools, especially those made by Anthropic. A selloff in global providers of data analytics, professional services, and software deepened after Anthropic launched plug-ins for the Claude Cowork agent on Friday—automating legal work like reviewing contracts, non-disclosure agreement triage, and compliance workflows. Investors fear that agentic AI capabilities could replace significant portions of the workflow automation, data management, and analytics services that have been the bread and butter of enterprise software companies.

Software stocks have also plunged because of their valuations, which surged in the past few years, with companies like Adobe and ServiceNow going through a valuation reset. Among the worst performers in software ETFs so far this year are Intuit, a maker of tax preparation software, and DocuSign, which handles PDFs and other documents, with both down more than 30% as investors question whether AI agents will replace their core offerings. The sector's struggles reflect a broader reckoning about which software companies can successfully integrate AI into their products versus those whose entire business models may be rendered obsolete by advancing AI capabilities.

### 2. Tech-to-Value Rotation Accelerates as "Old Economy" Sectors Outperform AI Giants
*Feb 2026*

> The U.S. stock market is witnessing a massive sector rotation as billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into "Old Economy" value sectors of basic materials, energy, and industrials, with small-cap value stocks up 5.94% in 2026 compared to large-cap growth at 2.80%.

The U.S. stock market is currently witnessing a tectonic shift in capital allocation as the "AI hype cycle" of the early 2020s gives way to the "Physical Reality" of 2026, with a massive sector rotation seeing billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into "Old Economy" value sectors of Basic Materials, Energy, and Industrials. While it's only a few weeks into 2026, the latest data shows that the tables are turning in the stock market, with small-cap companies outpacing large caps in an early reversal of last year's dynamic.

There's ongoing internal rotation within the market—some sectors (energy, materials, industrials, staples) are strong, while tech, consumer discretionary, and real estate lag. Investment firm Asbury's SEAF model currently favors industrials, materials, and energy, emphasizing defensive and cyclical sectors. Additionally, XLP (staples/defensive stocks) has outperformed XLY (consumer discretionary) since January 7th, with staples outperforming discretionary by 19%, signaling investors are rotating into safer, more defensive positions.

The AI boom of 2023–2025 focused on the models; the rotation of 2026 is focused on the power, the metal, and the machinery, mirroring the post-Dotcom era where after the collapse of speculative tech, the market spent years rewarding the companies that built the physical internet and global trade routes. Several sectors hit fresh all-time highs this week, such as industrials, materials, energy, and consumer staples, representing a shift from the tech-dominated gains of previous years. Wall Street's rotation into value has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bust, with analysts warning that the parallels—while not exact—suggest investors are reassessing which companies have sustainable business models versus those built primarily on growth narratives.

### 3. Nvidia Rebounds 8% as CEO Huang Declares AI Demand "Sky High" in CNBC Interview
*Feb 6-7*

> Nvidia shares surged more than 8% on Friday, February 7, after CEO Jensen Huang appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box declaring that demand for AI is "just incredibly high" and describing the current moment as a definitive "inflection point" where AI shifts from experimental curiosity to fundamental utility.

Jensen Huang told CNBC that demand for AI is "just incredibly high," stating that "the demand for Blackwell and our upcoming Vera Rubin platform is sky-high as nations and corporations realize that compute power is the new natural resource." Huang described the current moment as a definitive "inflection point," where AI is shifting from an experimental curiosity into a fundamental utility for every industry. Huang stated during the interview: "We are witnessing the largest infrastructure buildout in human history."

Huang said that the level of AI expenditures is appropriate and sustainable, and that the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure will continue for seven to eight years. Regarding compute constraints, Huang noted: "These guys are so compute-constrained, and demand is so incredibly great," referring to AI companies like Anthropic and OpenAI. Huang also defended the massive capital spending by hyperscalers, arguing that companies investing in AI infrastructure are making rational decisions that will pay off over the next decade.

Following the interview, shares of Nvidia surged more than 8%, contributing significantly to the broader market rally that propelled the Dow past the 50,000 milestone. The stock's performance helped provide a counterpoint to concerns about AI spending raised by Amazon and Alphabet's massive capex plans announced earlier in the week. Huang's bullish comments reassured investors that the AI infrastructure buildout has substantial runway remaining, supporting the thesis that semiconductor companies and infrastructure providers will continue to benefit even as questions mount about the returns for those doing the spending.

### 4. Consumer Sentiment Rises as Inflation Expectations Fall to Lowest Level Since January 2025
*Feb 7*

> The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 57.3 in February 2026, beating market expectations of 55, while year-ahead inflation expectations fell sharply to 3.5% from 4.0%—the lowest level since January 2025—though sentiment remained roughly 20% below its level from a year earlier.

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose by 0.9 points to 57.3 in February 2026, marking a third consecutive monthly increase and beating market expectations of 55. However, sentiment remained roughly 20% below its level in January 2025, reflecting persistent consumer anxiety about the economic outlook. The gains were driven largely by consumers with significant stock holdings, while sentiment among households without equity exposure stagnated at depressed levels.

Year-ahead inflation expectations fell sharply to 3.5% from 4.0% in January, the lowest level since January 2025, representing a significant improvement in near-term inflation psychology. However, longer-term inflation expectations edged up for a second month to 3.4% from 3.3%, suggesting consumers remain concerned about sustained price pressures beyond the immediate term. Concerns over the erosion of household finances due to high prices and the risk of job losses remain widespread, particularly among lower- and middle-income households.

The decline in near-term inflation expectations provided a boost to market sentiment on Friday, contributing to the broad rally that saw the Dow cross 50,000 for the first time. Treasury yields moved lower on the report, as investors interpreted the combination of moderating inflation expectations and still-subdued consumer confidence as supportive of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in the year. However, the bifurcation in sentiment between stock-owning households and those without equity exposure underscores the uneven nature of the economic recovery and ongoing wealth inequality concerns.

### 5. Treasury Yields Slide as Weak Jobs Data Raises Recession Concerns
*Feb 5-7*

> The 10-year Treasury yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.198% and the 30-year Treasury yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4.852% as investors reacted to weaker labor market data, with initial jobless claims hitting 231,000—well above expectations—and job openings falling to the lowest level since September 2020.

The 10-year Treasury yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.198%, and the 30-year Treasury yield was more than 6 basis points lower at 4.852%, with yields moving lower as investors reacted to weaker labor market data. Initial jobless claims for the week ended January 31 came in at 231,000, increasing by 22,000 from the prior weekly period and well above the 212,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had expected, raising concerns about labor market deterioration.

Job openings in December dropped to 6.54 million from the downwardly revised 6.93 million seen in November, and that new figure is the lowest level for job openings since September 2020. Additionally, the ADP report for January showed that private companies added only 22,000 positions last month, less than the 37,000 increase in December, reflecting a lackluster job market. The run of weaker labor data reinforced bets on multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, with markets still pricing in a first reduction in June and a second potentially in September.

The weak employment data contributed to the broader market selloff earlier in the week, raising questions about the strength of the economic expansion. However, Friday's strong rally suggested that investors are viewing the softening labor market as increasing the likelihood of Fed rate cuts rather than signaling an imminent recession. The bond market's reaction reflects the delicate balancing act the Federal Reserve faces: labor market weakness that justifies rate cuts versus persistent inflation concerns that argue for maintaining restrictive monetary policy.

### 6. Oil Prices Hold Near $60 as OPEC+ Maintains Cuts Through March Amid Oversupply Concerns
*Feb 2026*

> Brent crude oil futures traded near $60.87 per barrel while WTI remained at $57.46 as OPEC+ agreed to maintain voluntary production cuts through March 2026, with the EIA forecasting Brent will average $56 per barrel in 2026—19% less than 2025—as global production exceeds demand.

Brent Oil Futures expiring in March were nearly unchanged at $60.87 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $57.46 per barrel. The American Petroleum Institute reported a decline of 11.1 million barrels bringing stockpiles to 420.3 million barrels for the week ending February 4, representing a significant inventory drawdown that provided some support to prices.

The eight key member countries of the OPEC+ alliance, namely Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, met virtually on February 1 and agreed to maintain their current voluntary oil production cuts through March 2026. OPEC+ kept voluntary output cuts in place through March 2026 while reaffirming flexibility to adjust production levels in response to market conditions. The decision reflects the alliance's concern about weak demand growth and rising non-OPEC production, particularly from the United States and other non-member producers.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts the Brent crude oil price will average $56 per barrel in 2026, 19% less than in 2025, as global oil production exceeds global oil demand, causing oil inventories to rise. The consensus among leading analysts is that the market will be oversupplied in 2026, with the IEA seeing an implied oversupply of 3.8 million barrels per day due to weak demand. Global liquid fuels production growth in 2026 is driven by crude oil production growth in OPEC+ and increased output from U.S. shale producers, despite the cartel's efforts to support prices through supply management.

### 7. Trump Argentina Beef Import Expansion Sparks Cattle Industry Backlash

> President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on February 6 temporarily quadrupling imports of lean beef trimmings from Argentina under the U.S. tariff-rate quota, authorizing an 80,000 metric ton increase for 2026 to address supply shortages and ease consumer costs, drawing pushback from the cattle industry.

President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on February 6, 2026, temporarily quadrupling imports of lean beef trimmings from Argentina under the U.S. tariff-rate quota (TRQ). The proclamation authorizes an 80,000 metric ton increase in in-quota lean beef trimmings imports for 2026, which will be allocated entirely to Argentina. The additional beef will be distributed in four quarterly tranches of 20,000 metric tons each, beginning February 13, 2026, and continuing through the end of the year.

Trump expanded beef imports from Argentina by 80,000 metric tons in 2026 to address supply shortages and ease costs for consumers amid cattle crises. U.S. consumers have seen beef prices climb steadily in recent years, with ground beef reaching an average price of $6.69 per pound in December 2025, which was the highest level recorded since the 1980s. The administration framed the action as necessary to provide relief to American consumers facing historically high meat prices.

The announcement drew pushback from the nation's largest cattle industry group, which questioned whether increased imports would deliver the price relief the administration is promising. Industry representatives argued that the import expansion could depress domestic cattle prices and undermine American ranchers who are already struggling with drought conditions, high feed costs, and reduced herd sizes. The controversy highlights the tension between the administration's desire to address consumer inflation concerns and its support for domestic agricultural producers, with critics arguing that the policy prioritizes short-term price relief over long-term industry sustainability.

### 8. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings on Weight Loss Drug Boom
*Feb 4*

> Eli Lilly reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, exceeding analyst expectations as demand for blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars, with the pharmaceutical giant projecting 2026 revenue between $80 billion and $83 billion.

Eli Lilly posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue and 2026 guidance that blew past estimates, as demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, a year earlier, representing a 51% increase in earnings per share year-over-year.

Eli Lilly anticipates its 2026 revenue will come in between $80 billion and $83 billion, representing continued strong growth driven primarily by GLP-1 medications used for weight loss and diabetes management. The company also projects adjusted earnings to be between $33.50 and $35 per share for the year, significantly above Wall Street consensus estimates prior to the earnings release. The guidance reflects management's confidence that supply constraints that limited sales in 2025 have largely been resolved and that demand remains robust across both U.S. and international markets.

The blowout results underscore how weight loss drugs have become one of the most lucrative pharmaceutical categories in history, with Eli Lilly and competitor Novo Nordisk capturing the majority of a market that analysts project could exceed $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. The success of Zepbound (tirzepatide) for weight loss and Mounjaro for diabetes has transformed Eli Lilly's financial profile, with the drugs contributing tens of billions in annual revenue and driving the company's stock to record highs despite concerns about potential insurance coverage limitations and the long-term sustainability of premium pricing.

### 9. Pfizer Beats Estimates Despite Declining COVID Revenue, Reaffirms Modest 2026 Outlook
*Feb 3*

> Pfizer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped estimates even amid dwindling demand for its Covid products, with the company expecting 2026 revenue to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion—largely flat compared with 2025—as it navigates patent expirations and declining pandemic-related sales.

Pfizer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped estimates even amid dwindling demand for its Covid products. For 2026 guidance, Pfizer expects 2026 adjusted profit to come in between $2.80 and $3 per share, and revenue to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. Those sales would largely be flat compared with 2025 revenue, representing a stark contrast to the company's pandemic-era growth trajectory when COVID-19 vaccines and treatments drove record revenues.

The company expects declining sales of its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid to fall by about $1.5 billion year over year to $5 billion in 2026. Pfizer also pointed to another roughly $1.5 billion year-over-year expected drop in sales due to certain products losing their market exclusivity, reflecting the ongoing challenge of patent cliffs facing large pharmaceutical companies. The dual headwinds of declining COVID revenues and patent expirations are forcing Pfizer to rely more heavily on newer products and its pipeline to drive future growth.

Despite the modest outlook, Pfizer's ability to beat fourth-quarter estimates provided some reassurance to investors that the company is successfully managing the transition away from COVID-driven revenues. The pharmaceutical giant is investing heavily in cancer drugs, obesity treatments, and other therapeutic areas to offset declining sales from older products. However, the flat revenue guidance for 2026 highlights the significant challenges Pfizer faces in returning to sustained growth after the extraordinary but temporary boost provided by pandemic-related products.

### 10. Walmart CEO Transition Set for February as Retail Giant Maintains Strong Guidance
*Feb 1-2026*

> Walmart CEO Doug McMillon's retirement is scheduled for February 2026, with John Furner, the CEO of Walmart's U.S. business, set to succeed him on February 1 as the retail giant maintains expectations for full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1% despite consumer spending headwinds.

CEO Doug McMillon's retirement is scheduled for February 2026, with John Furner, the CEO of Walmart's U.S. business, set to succeed him on February 1. The leadership transition comes as Walmart expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1%, up from its previous expectations of 3.75% to 4.75%, reflecting the company's continued strong performance in capturing market share across income demographics. The company expects its adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63, a slight raise from previous guidance.

Walmart beat Wall Street expectations in its most recent quarter with strong food and health sales driving 6% revenue growth to $179.5 billion. Online sales jumped 28%, marking the company's seventh straight quarter of more than 20% e-commerce growth and underscoring the success of Walmart's omnichannel strategy. The consumer landscape is increasingly prioritizing value and convenience, with Walmart's strategic investments in omnichannel capabilities and e-commerce positioning it as a dominant force capable of attracting a diverse customer base, including a notable influx of higher-income households seeking affordability.

However, there has been some moderation in spending in the low-income cohort, consistent with macro perspectives, and in October, the disparity in wage growth between income cohorts was as large as it's been in almost a decade. The bifurcation in consumer behavior—with higher-income consumers trading down to Walmart while lower-income consumers struggle—highlights the uneven economic recovery and the challenges facing many American households despite overall economic growth. The CEO transition at such a critical juncture underscores the importance of maintaining strategic continuity while adapting to evolving retail dynamics and competitive pressures from both traditional rivals and e-commerce competitors.
