### 1. New START Nuclear Treaty Expires, Ending Five Decades of U.S.-Russia Arms Control
*Feb 5*

> The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time in more than half a century that the United States and Russia have no binding limits on their strategic nuclear arsenals, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a "grave moment" for global security with no new negotiations planned or underway.

The New START treaty officially expired on February 5, 2026, ending the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia and ushering in an unprecedented era without any legally binding limits on the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. The treaty, initially agreed in 2010 and extended for five years in 2021, had limited both nations to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads on 700 deployed nuclear delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and strategic bombers. The expiration marks the first time since the early 1970s that there are no legally binding constraints on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces, signaling a significant break in more than five decades of bilateral nuclear arms control.

Under the terms of the treaty, New START could only be extended once, so it was always going to end on February 5, 2026, though both countries could have negotiated a new deal to take effect when New START lapsed. However, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and sustained US military support for Kyiv, relations between Moscow and Washington deteriorated to their lowest point since the Cold War. In February 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Russia would suspend its compliance with the treaty, rejecting inspections and data exchange with the United States, effectively ending the verification mechanisms that had provided transparency into both nations' nuclear forces.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres issued a stark warning at the treaty's expiration, stating that "for the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals" of the two countries that possess approximately 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. There are currently no negotiations—bilateral or multilateral—and none are even planned to replace the expired agreement. The Trump administration has stated that any new nuclear arms control treaty should include China, whose nuclear arsenal has been rapidly expanding, but Beijing has shown no interest in trilateral arms control discussions. The absence of any framework for limiting nuclear weapons raises serious concerns about a renewed arms race, reduced strategic stability, and the erosion of the broader nuclear nonproliferation regime that has helped prevent nuclear weapons spread for decades.

### 2. U.S. and Azerbaijan Sign Strategic Partnership Charter as Vance Visits South Caucasus
*Feb 10*

> U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed a Charter on Strategic Partnership on February 10 in Baku covering security cooperation, artificial intelligence development, and energy security, as Washington seeks to expand influence in the South Caucasus region and diversify energy and trade flows away from Russia.

On February 10, a signing ceremony for the Charter on Strategic Partnership between the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Government of the United States of America was held in Baku, with President Ilham Aliyev and U.S. Vice President James David Vance signing the landmark agreement during Vance's first visit to the South Caucasus region. The charter affirms the importance of strategic partnership across areas of mutual interest and shared benefit, including regional connectivity, economic investment, security cooperation, counterterrorism collaboration, and energy security, marking a significant expansion of U.S. engagement in a region that has historically been in Russia's sphere of influence.

The partnership includes joint development of artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure projects, with the agreement supporting AI data centers, cybersecurity collaboration, and joint research and development mechanisms. This technological cooperation dimension reflects U.S. strategic competition with China and Russia in emerging technologies, as Washington seeks to establish partnerships with countries willing to align their digital infrastructure with Western standards rather than Chinese or Russian systems. Vance announced that the U.S. would send Azerbaijan an undisclosed number of ships to help it protect its territorial waters, a security commitment that underscores the strategic importance Washington places on this partnership.

Vance sought to advance the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP)," a proposed 43-kilometer corridor that would cut across Armenia and give Azerbaijan direct access to its exclave of Nakhchivan and to its close ally Turkey, better connecting Asia to Europe at a time when Washington wants to diversify energy and trade flows away from Russia. The corridor proposal has generated significant controversy in Armenia, which views the land corridor as compromising its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S.-Azerbaijan strategic partnership represents a significant geopolitical shift in the South Caucasus, potentially reshaping regional alignments and creating tension with Russia, which has historically served as the security guarantor for both Armenia and Azerbaijan. The agreement positions the United States as a major player in a strategically important region that sits at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, rich in energy resources and crucial for alternative trade routes bypassing Russia.

### 3. Sudan's RSF Bombs Military Hospital in South Kordofan, Killing 22 Including Medical Staff
*Feb 5*

> At least 22 people, including medical staff and the hospital's medical director, were killed in a drone strike by the Rapid Support Forces on a military hospital in El Kuik, South Kordofan state, on February 5, in an attack condemned as a war crime and violation of international humanitarian law protecting medical facilities and civilians.

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out a devastating drone strike on the El Kuik military hospital in South Kordofan state on Thursday, February 5, 2026, killing at least 22 people and wounding eight others in one of the deadliest single attacks on medical infrastructure since Sudan's civil war began in April 2023. The strike targeted the hospital and killed its medical director along with three other medical workers, representing a direct attack on healthcare personnel who are protected under international humanitarian law. The Sudan Doctors Network condemned the attack as a war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law protecting medical facilities and civilians.

The attack was part of a broader pattern of violence targeting health facilities in South Kordofan, with local observers saying the RSF's strategy aims to disable the remaining medical infrastructure and further deteriorate residents' humanitarian conditions. The World Health Organization reported that three strikes on health facilities in South Kordofan occurred in the same week, killing 31 people total, demonstrating a systematic campaign against healthcare rather than isolated incidents. The alliance between the RSF and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) has increasingly targeted health facilities in the state's urban centers, creating a humanitarian catastrophe as civilians lose access to emergency medical care.

The hospital bombing illustrates the brutal character of Sudan's civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions since fighting erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces nearly two years ago. The conflict has been characterized by mass atrocities including ethnic cleansing in Darfur, systematic sexual violence, attacks on civilians, and the deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid that has left millions facing famine conditions. The international response has been widely criticized as inadequate, with the conflict receiving far less attention and resources than other global crises despite the scale of human suffering. The targeting of medical facilities represents a particularly egregious violation of the laws of war and demonstrates the RSF's willingness to commit war crimes to achieve military objectives, further diminishing prospects for a negotiated settlement to Sudan's catastrophic civil war.

### 4. SpaceX Deactivates Starlink Terminals Used by Russian Forces in Ukraine
*Feb 5*

> SpaceX successfully blocked the use of unauthorized Starlink satellite communications systems being used by Russian forces in Ukraine by implementing a "whitelist" verification system that only allows registered Ukrainian terminals to operate, forcing Russian troops to halt planned strikes and creating a communications crisis on frontlines, according to Moscow officials.

In early February, SpaceX blocked the use of every Starlink terminal geolocated on Ukrainian territory except those registered and verified by Ukrainian authorities, effectively shutting down Russian forces' unauthorized use of the satellite communications systems that had become crucial for coordinating military operations. Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced that SpaceX is working with Ukraine to update a "whitelist" of approved and verified Starlink terminals every 24 hours, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked. Only after verification and inclusion into the white lists can terminals come back online, and any terminal moving faster than 90 kilometers per hour is automatically shut down to prevent use in drone attacks.

The deactivation had immediate and significant impact on Russian military operations, according to Andrey Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Moscow City Duma, who stated that planned strikes against Ukraine were stopped and a crisis emerged on the frontlines as Russian troops were unable to coordinate without Starlink connectivity. Russian forces had been acquiring Starlink terminals through third-party countries and smuggling networks, using the systems to coordinate artillery strikes, drone operations, and tactical communications despite the fact that SpaceX had officially limited Starlink sales to prevent military use by Russia. The successful blocking represents a major operational victory for Ukraine and demonstrates the potential for commercial satellite systems to be controlled and secured even in contested environments.

Elon Musk confirmed the success of SpaceX's efforts on February 1, writing on X that "Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked." The implementation of geolocation-based restrictions combined with the whitelist verification system shows how modern commercial space capabilities can be secured against adversarial use, though it also highlights the initial vulnerabilities that allowed Russian forces to exploit Starlink for military purposes. The blocking of Russian terminals provides Ukraine with a significant asymmetric advantage, as Ukrainian forces retain reliable satellite communications while Russian troops must rely on more vulnerable radio and cellular communications systems that are easier to intercept and jam. The incident underscores the growing importance of commercial space infrastructure in modern warfare and the geopolitical implications of companies like SpaceX controlling critical communications capabilities.

### 5. Trump and Netanyahu Meet at White House as Iran Nuclear Talks Continue
*Feb 11*

> President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for more than two hours at the White House on February 11, with Trump stating he "insisted" that negotiations with Iran continue to see if a nuclear deal can be reached, as the Pentagon prepares a second aircraft carrier strike group for possible deployment to the Middle East amid escalating tensions.

Trump met with Netanyahu for more than two hours behind closed doors on February 11 and said he'd insisted that negotiations with Iran continue, stating "there was nothing definitive reached, other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated." The meeting was their seventh since Trump returned to office and occurred as both the U.S. and Iran are pursuing indirect nuclear negotiations mediated by Oman, with recent talks characterized by both sides as "a good start" and worthy of continuation. The visit was expected to center on Iran policy, as Washington weighs diplomacy against the threat of military action and Israel pushes to shape the scope of negotiations.

Netanyahu was expected to push Trump to widen negotiations with Iran beyond its nuclear program, seeking to include restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program and demanding an end to Iranian support for Hamas and Hezbollah. Netanyahu's office stated the two sides "addressed negotiations with Iran, Gaza, and regional developments," with the Israeli leader emphasizing "Israel's security needs in the context of the negotiations." The meeting came against a backdrop of significant military preparations, with three U.S. officials telling The Wall Street Journal that the Pentagon has instructed another aircraft carrier strike group to get ready for deployment to the Middle East, likely the USS George H.W. Bush, as the U.S. military prepares for a possible strike on Iran.

The Pentagon is reportedly preparing to send the additional carrier within two weeks if diplomatic efforts fail, joining the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group already en route to the eastern Mediterranean. President Trump is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to strengthen U.S. military presence in the region as he threatens to authorize strikes on Iran if diplomacy falters. The combination of continued diplomatic engagement through the Oman channel and simultaneous military preparations reflects the Trump administration's strategy of negotiating from a position of military strength while maintaining the credible threat of force if negotiations fail. The outcome of the ongoing talks will have profound implications for Middle East stability, global energy markets, and the broader nuclear nonproliferation regime, with both the promise of a diplomatic breakthrough and the risk of military confrontation remaining very real possibilities.

### 6. Russian Military Intelligence Deputy Chief Shot and Critically Wounded in Moscow
*Feb 6*

> Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseyev, deputy chief of Russian military intelligence (GRU), was shot multiple times by an unknown assailant outside his Moscow apartment on February 6 in an apparent assassination attempt, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accusing Ukraine of orchestrating the attack without providing evidence, while Alekseyev remains hospitalized after emergency surgery.

Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseyev, a 64-year-old deputy chief of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and the agency's number two since 2011, was shot several times by an unknown assailant in a residential building in northwest Moscow around 6:30 a.m. local time on Friday, February 6. The attacker had been waiting when Alekseyev left his apartment to go to work, and the general sustained gunshot wounds to an arm, a leg, and his chest during a struggle. Alekseyev regained consciousness after being shot and seriously wounded, and is now awake after surgery, with doctors cautiously saying his life is not in danger, though the severity of his injuries indicates this was a determined assassination attempt.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Kyiv, without providing any evidence, of being behind the assassination attempt, claiming it was designed to sabotage the peace talks on the war in Ukraine. There has been no comment from Ukraine on the shooting, and Western officials have noted that Russia frequently makes accusations about Ukrainian involvement in attacks on Russian soil without presenting credible evidence. The shooting is the latest in a spate of attacks against senior military figures inside Russia, many of which have been blamed on Ukraine. Just over a month ago, another high-ranking Russian military official, Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, was killed by a bomb that exploded under his car in Moscow, part of a pattern of targeted killings of Russian military and intelligence officials.

The shooting of such a senior intelligence official in the heart of Moscow represents either a major security failure or potentially an inside attack, raising questions about the security of Russia's military leadership and the competence of protective services. Alekseyev's role as first deputy head of the GRU and cyber operations chief made him one of the most senior intelligence officials in Russia, with responsibilities spanning military intelligence collection, covert operations, and cyber warfare against Western targets. The assassination attempt, whether carried out by Ukrainian intelligence or another actor, demonstrates the vulnerability of even the most senior Russian officials and suggests that the war in Ukraine has generated significant blowback in the form of attacks on Russian territory targeting military and intelligence leadership. The incident is likely to further inflame tensions between Russia and Ukraine and could lead to Russian retaliation or escalation.

### 7. EU Leaders Hold Informal Summit to Discuss Competitiveness and Defense Support for Ukraine
*Feb 12*

> European Union leaders are meeting at an informal retreat at Alden Biesen on February 12 to discuss strengthening the single market and reducing economic dependencies in a changing geopolitical environment, while separate Foreign Affairs Council meetings on February 11 addressed EU military support for Ukraine and the security outlook for 2026.

EU leaders are participating in an informal meeting at Alden Biesen on February 12, 2026, to discuss how to strengthen the single market, reduce economic dependencies, and boost EU competitiveness in a new geoeconomic context shaped by U.S.-China strategic competition, the war in Ukraine, and energy transition challenges. The first working session started with a presentation by former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on the impact of the changing geopolitical and geoeconomic environment on the EU's competitiveness, followed by a leaders-only discussion about strategies to enhance European industrial capacity, secure critical supply chains, and reduce dependencies on strategic rivals.

On February 11, the Foreign Affairs Council with defense ministers exchanged views on EU military support to Ukraine with a focus on cooperation in defense innovation, and held an informal discussion on the security and defence outlook for 2026. The meeting addressed the urgent need to sustain military assistance to Ukraine as the war approaches its third anniversary, while also discussing European defense industrial capacity and the need for increased investment in military capabilities given deteriorating security conditions in Europe's neighborhood. Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson traveled to Brussels for several high-level meetings including these defense discussions, underscoring the importance Nordic countries place on European security cooperation.

On February 12, a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, co-chaired by the United Kingdom and Germany, is also taking place, with continued support for Ukraine being one of the topics at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. The series of meetings reflects Europe's urgent need to coordinate both economic and security strategies in response to a more hostile geopolitical environment, particularly as questions mount about the reliability of U.S. security commitments under the Trump administration and as Russia shows no signs of ending its war in Ukraine. The informal summit format allows for frank discussions among EU leaders without the formal conclusions and communiqués of regular European Council meetings, potentially enabling more creative problem-solving on how Europe can adapt to a world of intensifying great power competition and reduced certainty about the transatlantic alliance.

### 8. France Advances Next-Generation Nuclear Aircraft Carrier Program with February Shipyard Visit
*Feb 2026*

> French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that France's PANG (Porte-Avions Nouvelle Génération) next-generation aircraft carrier program will proceed to the realization phase, with construction of the 78,000-tonne nuclear-powered carrier beginning in 2026 and Macron planning a February visit to the shipyard to meet with suppliers involved in the $12 billion project.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France's PANG next generation aircraft carrier program will proceed to the realization phase, confirming that the French Navy's current CVN Charles de Gaulle will be replaced from 2038 by a significantly larger and more capable nuclear-powered carrier. Design and development activity completed over the past four years has resulted in a 78,000-tonne displacement ship with an overall length of 310 meters and a beam of approximately 90 meters, making it substantially larger than the 42,000-tonne Charles de Gaulle and comparable in size to the U.S. Navy's Gerald R. Ford-class carriers, positioning France to maintain its status as the only European nation operating nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

Unlike the Charles de Gaulle, the PANG will be equipped with U.S.-developed electromagnetic aircraft launch systems (EMALS), replacing steam catapults and enabling the operation of heavier and more diverse aircraft, including future combat aircraft and unmanned platforms. The EMALS system will provide greater flexibility in launching different types of aircraft and allow for higher sortie rates, significantly enhancing the carrier's combat capability. TechnicAtome is responsible, under contract to the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, for the design and delivery of the nuclear plant using two K-22 pressurized water reactors, with work on nuclear propulsion components having begun last year and the final order to be placed under the 2025 budget.

President Macron stated, "I will personally guarantee this commitment to our businesses by visiting the shipyard next February to meet with them," referring to his planned visit to the construction site in February 2026 to meet with the suppliers involved in the project. The PANG program represents France's determination to maintain its position as a global military power capable of power projection and independent action, even as defense budgets face pressure and other European nations scale back military capabilities. The carrier will serve as the centerpiece of French naval forces and will be capable of operating French Rafale fighters as well as potentially future European or U.S. carrier-based aircraft, providing France with strategic autonomy and the ability to lead European military operations independent of NATO structures if necessary. The program's continuation despite its enormous cost underscores France's commitment to maintaining military capabilities that distinguish it from other European powers.

### 9. Winter Olympics 2026: U.S. Athletes Compete in Milano Cortina Games
*Feb 12*

> American athletes Breezy Johnson and Chloe Kim are competing at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, with Johnson racing in the super-G on February 12 after winning downhill gold earlier in the Games, while Kim seeks a historic third consecutive Olympic gold in women's snowboard halfpipe, with the medal final scheduled for early February 13.

Breezy Johnson goes in the super-G on February 12, having previously won Olympic downhill gold at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. Johnson could become the first U.S. female skier to win both speed races at the same Games if she medals in the super-G, marking a historic achievement in alpine skiing. Johnson had previously won the world title in downhill and added Olympic gold to her accomplishments earlier in the Games, establishing herself as one of the dominant speed skiers in women's alpine racing. Her performance in the downhill was particularly impressive, demonstrating technical precision and fearless high-speed skiing on the challenging Italian course.

Chloe Kim is chasing history at the Milano Cortina 2026 Games, aiming for a historic third consecutive Olympic gold in women's snowboard halfpipe. Kim aims to achieve this feat while overcoming a recent shoulder injury that threatened her preparation for the Games. The medal final is scheduled for the early hours of February 13, following qualifiers that took place on February 11. Kim has been one of the most dominant athletes in Winter Olympics history, having won gold in women's halfpipe at both the 2018 PyeongChang Games and the 2022 Beijing Olympics, and a third consecutive gold would cement her legacy as one of the greatest snowboarders of all time.

The Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics represent Italy's return to hosting the Winter Games and showcase winter sports excellence across multiple disciplines. American athletes have been competing across various events, with Team USA seeking medals in alpine skiing, snowboarding, ice hockey, speed skating, and other winter sports disciplines. The Games are taking place in venues across the Italian cities of Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, with competitions scheduled through late February. The performances of athletes like Johnson and Kim provide moments of national pride and demonstrate American competitiveness in winter sports, even as the Games occur against a complex geopolitical backdrop and amid ongoing debates about the climate impacts that threaten winter sports venues around the world.

### 10. U.S. Tariffs on Imports Reach Highest Level Since 1946 as Manufacturing Impact Emerges
*Feb 6*

> The weighted average applied tariff rate on all U.S. imports rose to 13.5% as of February 6, 2026—the highest average rate since 1946—with the average effective tariff rate reaching 9.9% after accounting for behavioral responses, as manufacturers report job losses and increased costs from the Trump administration's expanded tariff policies.

As of February 6, 2026, the weighted average applied tariff rate on all imports rose to 13.5 percent, and the average effective tariff rate, reflecting behavioral responses such as shifting sourcing and reduced trade volumes, rose to 9.9 percent—the highest average rate since 1946. The weighted average applied tariff rate on imports rose from 1.5% in 2022 to an estimated 14.0% in 2026, representing a dramatic expansion of protectionist trade policy under the Trump administration. After incorporating behavioral responses as companies shift supply chains and reduce imports of heavily tariffed goods, the average effective tariff rate reaches 10.1%, marking a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy not seen in decades.

The tariffs are having significant negative employment effects on the manufacturing sector they were ostensibly designed to protect. Employers shed 8,000 manufacturing jobs in December 2025 nationwide, while payrolls in the sector shrank by 72,000 positions overall between April's tariff impositions and December. The tariffs are increasing the cost of manufacturing cars in the U.S., which could lead to less innovation, more expensive cars, and lower sales, according to automotive industry analysts. These new tariffs appear to be particularly damaging to high-wage, high-value advanced manufacturing industries that have continued to thrive in the industrial Midwest, especially hurting advanced high-tech manufacturing products that rely on global supply chains.

The Trump tariffs amount to an average tax increase per U.S. household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026, according to analysis by the Tax Foundation. Tariffs disrupt trade even before they take effect, with higher costs weakening demand and shifting sourcing patterns, while policy volatility discourages long-term investment and planning by businesses uncertain about future trade policy. Ongoing global conflicts, dynamic imposition of tariffs, and expansion of export controls continue to affect sourcing, transportation flows, logistics planning, and long-term manufacturing footprints, with tariffs remaining difficult to predict as exemption pathways are unevenly implemented. The economic impact of the tariff escalation is becoming increasingly evident in manufacturing employment data, consumer prices, and business investment decisions, raising questions about whether the policy will achieve its stated goals of reshoring production and strengthening American manufacturing or whether it will instead reduce economic growth and harm the industries it aims to protect.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Wealth Management Stocks Plunge on AI Disruption Fears After Altruist Launches Tax Planning Tool
*Feb 11*

> Financial services stocks experienced sharp declines on February 11 as AI disruption fears swept the sector, with LPL Financial falling 8.3%, Charles Schwab tumbling 7.4%, and Raymond James dropping 8.8% after fintech startup Altruist unveiled an artificial intelligence tool for automated tax planning, raising concerns that AI could replace human financial advisers.

European and American wealth management companies were rattled by artificial intelligence developments on February 11, as a new tool spurred concern that parts of the industry will be automated, triggering the worst single-day decline for wealth management stocks since March 2020. St James's Place Plc led a selloff on Wednesday, tumbling as much as 13%, with its UK peer Quilter Plc also falling significantly. Swiss firms Julius Baer Group Ltd and UBS Group AG both declined about 4%, while in the United States, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. lost 8.3%, Charles Schwab Corp. sank 7.4%, and Raymond James Financial Inc. dropped 8.8%.

The jitters erupted after closely held tech startup Altruist Corp. unveiled a new tool on Tuesday that helps financial advisers personalize tax strategies for clients and create pay stubs, account statements, and other documents, with the company claiming the AI tool can complete tasks within "minutes" that traditionally required hours of human labor. The announcement sparked investor fears that AI-powered automation could significantly reduce the value of established advisory firms and banking services by either replacing human advisers entirely or dramatically reducing the fees that firms can charge for services that become commoditized through automation. The sell-off extended earlier concerns that emerged last week after Anthropic released AI tools aimed at automating work tasks in areas ranging from legal services to financial research.

Charles Schwab President and Chief Executive Officer Rick Wurster told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday that he was "disappointed and surprised" by the company's stock slide, arguing that rather than being threatened by AI, Schwab is already embracing the technology to make its financial advisers more efficient and expand its ability to serve customers. However, investors appeared unconvinced by these reassurances, with the Wall Street selloff reflecting a growing pattern where any industry shown to be vulnerable to AI disruption experiences immediate and severe stock price declines. The wealth management sector joins a growing list of industries—including software, legal services, and healthcare—where investors are reassessing business models and valuations based on the assumption that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape competitive dynamics, reduce labor requirements, and compress profit margins. The speed and severity of the selloff demonstrates the heightened sensitivity of markets to AI disruption themes and raises questions about whether traditional service businesses can maintain premium valuations in an era of rapid automation.

### 2. Treasury Yields Surge as January Jobs Report Beats Expectations with 130,000 Payroll Additions
*Feb 11*

> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 2 basis points to 4.174% on February 11 after the U.S. economy added 130,000 jobs in January—significantly more than the 55,000 additions expected by economists—reducing expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and pushing futures markets to price in no rate reductions until July at the earliest.

The stronger-than-expected January jobs report caused Treasury yields to rise on February 11, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield climbing more than 2 basis points to 4.174%, while the 2-year Treasury note yield surged more than 5 basis points to 3.512%. The U.S. added 130,000 jobs in January, significantly exceeding the 55,000 additions that economists had expected following December's weak performance, demonstrating that the labor market remains more resilient than feared and reducing the urgency for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The unemployment rate held at 4.4%, and wage growth remained steady, suggesting the economy continues to add jobs at a pace consistent with moderate expansion rather than recession or overheating.

Treasury bonds fell in early trading Wednesday and their yields rose as the stronger employment data essentially signaled that the labor market remains resilient, reducing the likelihood of near-term interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and pushing yields higher. Futures markets indicated that traders don't see much of a chance of a rate cut until July at the earliest, representing a significant shift from earlier expectations that the Fed might cut rates as soon as March or May. The jobs report's surprise to the upside came after the data release had been delayed due to the recent government shutdown, creating unusual uncertainty about labor market conditions and causing markets to trade with less conviction in the days leading up to the report.

A surprise surge in US jobs hit Treasuries as traders pared bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, with the latest monthly employment report underscoring a robust economy that may not merit imminent policy easing. The market is aggressively pricing out rate cuts for this year after the jobs report, reflecting a reassessment of the economic outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The Treasury yield response demonstrates how sensitive markets are to economic data that influences Fed policy expectations, with even modest surprises in employment data capable of generating significant moves in bond prices. The increase in yields creates headwinds for interest-rate-sensitive sectors including housing and technology while potentially supporting financial sector profitability through higher net interest margins. The jobs report and Treasury market reaction set the stage for Thursday's consumer price index data, which will provide further evidence about whether inflation pressures are continuing to moderate or whether the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer to ensure price stability.

### 3. Applied Materials, Arista Networks, and Airbnb Report Earnings on February 12
*Feb 12*

> Major technology companies including Applied Materials (AMAT), Arista Networks (ANET), Airbnb (ABNB), and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on February 12, providing critical insights into semiconductor equipment demand, data center networking spending, travel sector recovery, and global consumer beverage consumption.

February 12, 2026 is one of the busiest days of earnings season, with 205 companies scheduled to report quarterly results, including several major corporations whose performance will provide important signals about key sectors of the global economy. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, with investors focused on order trends for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as a leading indicator of the chip industry's health and the sustainability of massive capital expenditure programs by semiconductor manufacturers expanding capacity for AI processors and advanced chips. As a supplier of equipment essential for chip fabrication, Applied Materials' results offer visibility into whether the semiconductor investment cycle is accelerating, maintaining momentum, or beginning to slow.

Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE: ANET) will release its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, after U.S. markets close on Thursday, February 12, 2026. Analysts expect Arista Networks to post earnings of $0.75 per share and revenue of $2.3839 billion for the quarter, with the company's performance providing crucial data on enterprise spending for networking infrastructure at a time when companies are making massive investments in AI capabilities and data center expansion. As a supplier of networking equipment that connects servers and enables high-speed data transfer within data centers, Arista's results indicate whether the AI investment wave is translating into sustained demand for networking infrastructure or whether spending is concentrated among a few hyperscale cloud providers.

Airbnb Inc. (ABNB) is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, with the vacation rental platform's results offering insights into consumer travel demand, pricing power in the accommodation sector, and the health of the global tourism industry. Airbnb's performance reflects both leisure travel patterns and the broader consumer spending environment, making it a useful indicator of discretionary spending and consumer confidence. Anheuser Busch Inbev will release its next earnings report on February 12, 2026, with revenue forecast at $14.63 billion, providing data on global consumer beverage demand and the company's ability to maintain pricing power amid inflation and shifting consumer preferences.

### 4. January Existing Home Sales Data Release Scheduled for February 12
*Feb 12*

> The National Association of Realtors will release existing-home sales data for January 2026 on Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern, providing critical information about housing market activity, inventory levels, and price trends as mortgage rates have fallen to 6.11%—the lowest level in three years.

Existing-Home Sales for January 2026 will be released on Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern by the National Association of Realtors, representing the major real estate data event scheduled for the day and providing crucial insights into housing market conditions as the sector navigates the impact of elevated prices, improving mortgage rates, and limited inventory. The report will show how many previously owned homes changed hands in January, offering the first read on 2026 housing market activity and potentially signaling whether improving affordability conditions from lower mortgage rates are beginning to drive increased transaction volumes.

As of late January 2026, housing market conditions showed gradual improvement from 2025's depressed levels, with active inventory at the end of January 2026 showing that 9 states were above pre-pandemic 2019 levels: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington. Nationally aggregated home prices were close to flat year-over-year, suggesting that the rapid price appreciation that characterized the pandemic era has given way to price stabilization as higher mortgage rates reduced affordability and dampened demand. However, mortgage rates have recently fallen to 6.11%, the lowest level in three years, spurring increased housing activity and generating optimism that transaction volumes may recover from 2025's multi-decade lows.

Existing-home sales are projected to rise by around 14% in 2026, according to National Association of REALTORS® Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, driven by improving affordability as mortgage rates decline and as inventory gradually increases from historically depressed levels. Home prices are forecast to increase by 4% in 2026, supported by steady demand and persistent supply shortages, though the pace of appreciation is expected to moderate significantly from the double-digit gains experienced in 2021-2022. The January existing home sales report will provide the first evidence of whether this optimistic forecast is materializing, or whether affordability challenges and economic uncertainty are continuing to constrain housing market activity. The housing sector represents a significant component of economic activity through construction, financial services, and consumer spending on home-related goods, making the existing home sales data particularly important for assessing overall economic momentum.

### 5. Evercore Reports Record Earnings as M&A Activity Surges to $4.5 Trillion in 2025
*Feb 4*

> Evercore reported record-breaking fourth-quarter earnings on February 4, 2026 that exceeded analyst expectations, with the investment bank benefiting from a dramatic recovery in global merger and acquisition activity that reached $4.5 trillion in 2025—a nearly 50% increase from 2024 lows—as CEO John Weinberg noted that the firm's backlog entering 2026 is at an all-time high.

On February 4, 2026, Evercore reported record-breaking fourth-quarter earnings that shattered analyst expectations, with the firm delivering record fourth quarter and full year revenues while ranking #3 globally in Advisory revenues among public firms for the second consecutive year and achieving market share at an all-time high. The investment bank's performance reflected a dramatic recovery in mergers and acquisitions activity, with the global M&A market experiencing a "V-shaped" recovery in 2025 as total deal value reached $4.5 trillion, marking a nearly 50% increase from the lows of 2024. This rebound was fueled by the return of the "megadeal," with 70 transactions exceeding the $10 billion mark as improved financing conditions, CEO confidence, and strategic urgency drove large-scale consolidation.

CEO John Weinberg noted during the earnings call that the firm's backlog entering 2026 is at an all-time high, suggesting that the momentum is accelerating rather than tapering and that the first half of the year is already "locked in" with significant transaction volume. Record-high backlogs reported by Evercore and Goldman Sachs indicate that major investment banks have secured advisory mandates for deals that will generate fees throughout 2026, providing unusual visibility into near-term financial performance. For the fourth quarter and full year, approximately 45% of Evercore's revenues were generated from non-M&A businesses, with nearly all of the firm's businesses posting record results, including North America and EMEA advisory businesses, private capital advisory, private funds group, equities business, and wealth management.

The strong Evercore results and broader M&A recovery signal several important themes for financial markets and corporate strategy. First, the return of large-scale M&A suggests that CEOs have sufficient confidence in the economic outlook and financing environment to pursue transformative deals rather than pursuing only smaller, lower-risk transactions. Second, the rebound demonstrates that companies are responding to competitive pressures, technological disruption, and the need for scale by pursuing strategic combinations, with particular activity in technology, healthcare, and financial services sectors. Third, the investment banking industry is benefiting from the normalization of deal activity after several years of depressed volumes, with the recovery in M&A advisory fees helping offset challenges in other parts of the investment banking business including equity and debt underwriting. The record backlog suggests that 2026 could be one of the strongest years for M&A activity in the past decade, providing significant tailwinds for investment banks and professional services firms while potentially reshaping competitive landscapes across multiple industries.

### 6. Semiconductor Industry on Track for $1 Trillion in Sales in 2026 as AI Drives Capex Surge
*Feb 2026*

> The Semiconductor Industry Association announced that global semiconductor sales hit $791.7 billion in 2025—an increase of 25.6% compared to 2024—with annual sales projected to reach roughly $1 trillion worldwide in 2026, driven by insatiable demand for AI processors and data center infrastructure as AI chip market alone estimated at $500 billion.

The Semiconductor Industry Association announced that global semiconductor sales hit $791.7 billion in 2025, an increase of 25.6% compared to 2024, with annual sales projected to reach roughly $1 trillion worldwide in 2026 according to industry forecasts. WSTS predicts a 26% jump in semiconductor sales in 2026 to $975 billion, while Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya anticipates an even stronger jump of 30% in the industry's revenue, to just over $1 trillion. The projected growth reflects unprecedented demand for semiconductors across multiple end markets, with artificial intelligence applications serving as the primary driver as tech companies invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure.

Deloitte estimates that the AI chip market in 2026 will be about $500 billion, representing approximately half of total semiconductor industry revenue and demonstrating the dominance of AI-related demand in driving the sector's explosive growth. The jump in AI infrastructure spending in 2026 is serving as a catalyst for the semiconductor industry, with companies including NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and specialized AI chip designers benefiting from orders for processors capable of training and running large language models and other AI workloads. However, the overall industry outlook presents a nuanced picture, with chip designers and manufacturers that currently benefit from AI tailwinds potentially facing headwinds in other market segments, as revenue growth in consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial semiconductors could decrease or turn negative.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a critical supplier for AI processors, is expected to see consensus estimates predict a 25% increase in earnings in 2026, down from the 48% growth estimated for 2025, though the company could easily exceed Wall Street's expectations given the sustained strength of AI demand. The semiconductor industry's path to $1 trillion in annual sales represents a remarkable achievement for a sector that was valued at just $200 billion as recently as 2010, reflecting the central role that semiconductors play in virtually every aspect of modern technology from smartphones to data centers to automobiles. The concentration of growth in AI-related chips creates both opportunities and risks, with companies highly exposed to AI infrastructure benefiting from unprecedented demand while those serving other markets face more challenging conditions. The sustainability of the AI investment cycle will be critical for determining whether the semiconductor industry can maintain its torrid growth pace or whether a normalization in AI spending would cause industry revenues to plateau or decline from peak levels.

### 7. Federal Reserve Holds Rates at 3.5-3.75% as Dissenting Officials Call for Cuts
*Jan 28*

> The Federal Reserve is maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 3.5-3.75 percent following their January 28, 2026 meeting, putting a halt to three consecutive quarter percentage point reductions in late 2025, though Fed officials Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented and preferred to lower rates by 1/4 percentage point.

The Federal Reserve is maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 3.5-3.75 percent, following their January 28, 2026 meeting, marking a pause in monetary policy easing after three consecutive quarter percentage point reductions occurred in late 2025. The decision to hold rates steady reflected the Federal Open Market Committee's assessment that "available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization," though the committee noted that "inflation remains somewhat elevated," suggesting continued vigilance about price pressures.

Not all Fed officials agreed with holding rates steady, with Stephen I. Miran and Christopher J. Waller voting against this action, preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting. The dissenting votes reflect ongoing disagreement among Fed officials about the appropriate path forward for monetary policy, with some policymakers viewing current rates as too restrictive given moderating inflation and others concerned that premature rate cuts could allow inflation to re-accelerate. The split vote demonstrates the difficulty the Fed faces in calibrating policy when economic conditions are neither clearly overheating nor clearly weakening, requiring judgment about whether risks are tilted toward inflation or recession.

Looking ahead, futures markets are pricing in at most two rate reductions in 2026 and none in 2027, a significant shift from earlier expectations that the Fed would cut rates more aggressively in 2026. However, there is disagreement among Fed officials about the appropriate path forward, with some calling for more substantial cuts while others favor maintaining the current stance or potentially even raising rates if inflation proves more persistent than expected. Fed Chair Powell has indicated the current policy stance may not be restrictive, comments that suggest the bar for additional cuts is high and that the Fed will require clear evidence of weakening economic conditions or sustainably declining inflation before easing policy further. The January jobs report showing 130,000 payroll additions reinforced the case for maintaining current rates, as the resilient labor market suggests the economy can sustain its expansion without additional monetary stimulus. The Fed's decision to pause rate cuts creates a more challenging environment for leveraged borrowers and risk assets while potentially supporting the dollar and providing greater confidence in the inflation outlook if the pause proves successful in ensuring price pressures continue to moderate.

### 8. Housing Inventory Up 10% Year-Over-Year as Nine States Exceed Pre-Pandemic Levels
*Jan 31*

> Housing market inventory was up 10% year-over-year through January 31, 2026, with nine states—Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington—now exceeding pre-pandemic 2019 active inventory levels, suggesting gradual normalization of housing supply after years of extreme shortages.

At the end of January 2026, nine states were above pre-pandemic 2019 active inventory levels: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington, according to analysis of inventory data through January 31, 2026. Housing market inventory is up 10% year-over-year nationally, representing a significant improvement from the extreme inventory shortages that characterized the housing market in 2021-2023 when ultra-low mortgage rates and pandemic-driven demand created bidding wars and rapid price appreciation. The inventory increase reflects multiple factors including new construction adding supply, some homeowners deciding to sell despite rate lock-in effects, and moderating demand as affordability challenges have sidelined some potential buyers.

The states showing above-normal inventory levels are concentrated in the Sun Belt and Mountain West regions that experienced particularly rapid population growth and homebuilding during the pandemic, suggesting that these markets may be experiencing supply-demand rebalancing as construction catches up with earlier demand surges. Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Tennessee were among the fastest-growing states during the pandemic as remote work enabled migration from higher-cost coastal markets, generating intense housing demand that stimulated construction booms. Now, as some of that migration has normalized and builders have delivered new homes, these markets are seeing inventory levels that exceed pre-pandemic norms, potentially moderating price appreciation or even leading to price declines in some submarkets.

Nationally, housing inventory remains below pre-pandemic levels in most markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest where new construction has been more limited and zoning restrictions constrain supply growth. Nationally aggregated home prices were pretty close to flat year-over-year as of late January 2026, a dramatic shift from the double-digit price gains that characterized 2021-2022. The inventory improvement is a necessary condition for housing affordability to improve and for the market to function more normally, allowing buyers more time to evaluate options and reducing the extreme seller leverage that characterized recent years. However, inventory levels remain below what would be considered a balanced market in most regions, and combined with mortgage rates that, while improving, remain well above pandemic-era lows, the housing market continues to face affordability challenges that limit transaction volumes and accessibility for first-time buyers. The divergence between states with above-normal and below-normal inventory suggests that housing market conditions are increasingly local rather than national, with some markets facing oversupply risks while others continue to experience persistent shortages.

### 9. S&P 500 Earnings Growth Hits 13% in Q4 2025 for Tenth Consecutive Quarter of Expansion
*Feb 6*

> The S&P 500 is reporting double-digit year-over-year earnings growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, with 59% of companies having reported actual results for Q4 2025 showing aggregate earnings growth of 13% and 76% of companies beating EPS estimates by an average of 7.6%, according to FactSet analysis.

More than halfway through the Q4 earnings season, the S&P 500 is reporting solid results with 59% of companies having reported actual results for Q4 2025 to date, according to FactSet analysis released February 6, 2026. The S&P 500 is reporting double-digit year-over-year earnings growth for the 5th straight quarter, with aggregate earnings 13% above the same period in 2024, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings expansion. This sustained earnings growth streak demonstrates the resilience of corporate profitability despite concerns about economic slowdown, inflation pressures, and geopolitical uncertainties that have periodically weighed on market sentiment.

The quality of earnings beats has been strong, with 76% of companies reporting actual EPS above estimates, well above the historical average of approximately 70%. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.6% above estimates, indicating that analysts underestimated corporate performance or that companies successfully managed costs and drove revenue better than expected. The earnings growth is notably broad-based rather than concentrated in a few mega-cap technology companies, though the magnitude of growth varies significantly across sectors with energy, industrials, and materials showing particularly strong performance while utilities and real estate investment trusts have experienced more modest growth.

The strong earnings performance has important implications for equity valuations and market direction. With the S&P 500 trading near all-time highs, the 13% earnings growth helps justify elevated price levels by improving the relationship between price and earnings, reducing forward P/E ratios even as index levels remain elevated. However, the forward-looking question is whether this pace of earnings growth can be sustained, or whether comparisons will become more difficult in coming quarters as companies lap stronger year-ago results and face economic headwinds including tariff impacts, potentially slowing consumer spending, and margin pressures from wage growth. Corporate guidance for Q1 and full-year 2026 has been cautiously optimistic, with most companies expecting continued growth but at a moderating pace relative to 2025's strong performance. The tenth consecutive quarter of earnings growth represents a remarkable run of corporate profitability expansion and has been the fundamental driver of stock market gains, but investors remain focused on whether deteriorating economic indicators or external shocks could end the earnings growth streak and force markets to reprice based on recessionary scenarios rather than continued expansion.

### 10. Producer Price Inflation Jumps 0.5% in January as Tariff Costs Begin Impacting Businesses
*Feb 2026*

> Producer price inflation jumped 0.5% in January 2026 as businesses began passing tariff costs to consumers, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, raising concerns that the Trump administration's expanded tariff policies will reignite inflation pressures just as the Federal Reserve was making progress on price stability.

Producer price inflation jumped 0.5% in January as businesses began passing tariff costs to consumers, marking a significant acceleration from prior months and raising concerns that the Trump administration's expanded tariff policies will create renewed inflationary pressures throughout the economy. The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the prices that businesses receive for their goods and services, making it a leading indicator of consumer inflation as companies typically pass along higher input costs to end customers with a lag. The 0.5% monthly increase, if sustained, would translate to an annualized inflation rate of approximately 6%, well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target and comparable to inflation rates that forced aggressive monetary tightening in 2022-2023.

The acceleration in producer prices reflects multiple factors, with tariff-related cost increases playing a significant role as the weighted average applied tariff rate on U.S. imports has reached 13.5%—the highest level since 1946. Businesses across manufacturing, retail, and services sectors have reported that tariffs on imported inputs including steel, aluminum, electronic components, and consumer goods are forcing price increases to protect profit margins. The tariff impact is particularly evident in goods-producing sectors where global supply chains and imported components are integral to production processes, making it difficult or impossible to quickly shift to domestic suppliers without incurring even higher costs or accepting lower quality.

The jump in producer prices creates a challenging dilemma for the Federal Reserve, which had been expecting inflation to continue moderating in 2026 based on easing supply chain pressures, moderating wage growth, and cooling commodity prices. However, if tariff-driven cost increases feed through to consumer prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index, the Fed may face pressure to maintain restrictive monetary policy for longer than markets currently anticipate, or potentially even resume rate increases if inflation expectations become unanchored. Businesses have indicated that the timing and magnitude of price increases will depend on competitive dynamics, with companies in highly competitive markets more reluctant to raise prices for fear of losing market share, while those with pricing power in less competitive markets are already implementing increases. The producer price data suggests that the Trump administration's tariff policies, intended to protect American manufacturing and generate government revenue, may have the unintended consequence of reigniting inflation and forcing the Fed to keep interest rates higher, potentially slowing economic growth and undermining the very industries the tariffs were meant to protect.
