### 1. Ukraine and Russia Exchange 314 Prisoners After Abu Dhabi Talks, First Swap in Five Months
*Feb 5*

> US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi concluded with Ukraine and Russia agreeing to exchange 314 prisoners of war—the first such swap since October—while the US and Russia committed to reestablishing military-to-military dialogue.

The trilateral talks between American, Ukrainian, and Russian negotiators concluded in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, with both Moscow and Kyiv exchanging 157 prisoners each. The Ukrainians returned home included soldiers from the Armed Forces, National Guard, and the State Border Guard Service, with most having been in captivity since 2022. US presidential peace envoy Steve Witkoff led the American mediation team alongside Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, calling the exchange "tangible progress" while acknowledging significant work remains to end the war.

The negotiations took place over two days in Abu Dhabi, with officials working in trilateral consultations, group work, and synchronization of positions. The Ukrainian delegation included Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, and Andrii Hnatov, the chief of the General Staff. The Russian team was led by Kiril Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and Igor Kostyukov, head of the GRU military intelligence service. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there are reasons to be "cautiously optimistic" about the trajectory of talks.

Beyond the prisoner exchange, the US and Russia agreed to reestablish high-level military-to-military dialogue—a significant development given the near-complete breakdown in communication between the two nuclear powers since 2022. The talks came as President Zelenskyy called on Trump to send more weapons to put Ukraine in a better position to force Russian President Putin to end the war. The EU has also agreed on a €90 billion loan to finance Kyiv's defense against Russia, signaling continued European support regardless of the outcome of US-brokered negotiations.

### 2. UK Prime Minister Starmer Apologizes to Epstein Victims as Leadership Crisis Deepens
*Feb 5*

> British Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly apologized to Jeffrey Epstein's victims for appointing Peter Mandelson as US ambassador, claiming the diplomat "lied repeatedly" about his relationship with the convicted sex offender as newly released DOJ files revealed the full extent of their ties.

In an excruciating display before Parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer apologized to victims of Jeffrey Epstein after the US Justice Department released files revealing new details of Peter Mandelson's close relationship with the late sex offender. Starmer stated he was "sorry" directly to the victims, adding that "if I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government." The apology came as pressure mounted from Labour MPs angry at Starmer's decision to appoint Mandelson despite knowing about his links to Epstein.

Starmer had appointed Mandelson as ambassador to the US in December 2024 and fired him last September after emails showed he maintained a friendship with Epstein following the financier's 2008 conviction for sex offenses involving minors. The newly released DOJ files suggested Mandelson had leaked government documents to Epstein and that Epstein had recorded payments to Mandelson or his then-partner. Bank documents show Epstein sent three payments totaling $75,000 between 2003 and 2004 to accounts linked to Mandelson, though Mandelson claims he does not remember receiving the money.

The prime minister now faces speculation about a challenge to his leadership from within the Labour Party, less than two years after winning a landslide election victory. The Metropolitan Police confirmed they have launched an investigation "into a 72-year-old man, a former Government Minister, for misconduct in public office offence." The scandal has left a vacuum in Labour's transatlantic strategy at a critical moment in UK-US relations, with Mandelson's resignation from the House of Lords and the Labour Party marking a dramatic fall for one of Britain's most influential political figures.

### 3. US Launches Renewed Strikes Against ISIS in Syria After Palmyra Ambush
*Feb 4*

> US Central Command announced five strikes against multiple Islamic State targets in Syria as part of "Operation Hawkeye Strike," a sustained campaign launched after a December 2025 ambush killed two US service members and an American interpreter near Palmyra.

Between January 27 and February 2, US forces carried out five strikes against various ISIS targets, destroying a communication site, a critical logistics center, and weapons storage facilities with 50 precision munitions delivered by fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and unmanned aircraft. The strikes are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, CENTCOM's response to a December 13, 2025 ISIS ambush against US and Syrian forces in Palmyra that left two American service members and an interpreter dead—the deadliest attack on US forces in Syria since the establishment of the counter-ISIS mission.

Since the operation's launch, CENTCOM has killed or captured more than 50 ISIS members, including Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, an ISIS leader directly connected to the Palmyra ambush who was killed in a January 16 strike. The campaign underscores the persistent ISIS threat in Syria despite years of territorial defeat, with the group maintaining operational capability through cells scattered across the Syrian desert. A UN official warned this week of rising ISIS attacks worldwide, noting the group has exploited instability in Syria and other regions to rebuild its networks.

The strikes came as Syria undergoes significant political transformation following the integration of Kurdish forces under a US-brokered deal in early February. The new transitional government has struggled to establish security across the country's fractured territory, with ISIS capitalizing on governance vacuums. The US maintains approximately 900 troops in Syria focused on counter-ISIS operations, a presence that has drawn criticism from various quarters but which military officials argue remains essential to preventing the group's resurgence.

### 4. Iran and US Set for High-Stakes Nuclear Talks in Oman After Last-Minute Venue Change
*Feb 5*

> Nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States are scheduled for Friday in Oman after the original Turkey venue nearly collapsed over disagreements about scope and format, with Tehran seeking narrow discussions on its nuclear program while Washington pushes for broader topics including missiles and regional proxies.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed that Iran and the US will hold nuclear talks at 10am in Muscat on Friday (06:00 GMT), after Oman salvaged negotiations that had nearly derailed over disagreements about both the location and format of discussions. The original plan called for talks in Turkey with foreign ministers from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey participating as mediators, but Tehran pulled back from earlier understandings, reportedly wanting discussions limited strictly to its nuclear program with only Iranian and US officials at the table.

The stakes are immense given the expiration of the New START treaty on February 5, which ends the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the US and Russia. While that treaty did not directly involve Iran, the broader nuclear non-proliferation framework is under unprecedented strain. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made clear that Washington hopes discussions will extend beyond nuclear issues to include Iran's ballistic missile program, its support for proxy groups across the Middle East, and "the treatment of their own people"—a reference to the ongoing brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that has killed over 6,400 people.

President Trump struck a tough note ahead of discussions, issuing a blunt warning to Iran's Supreme Leader: "I would say he should be very worried." The talks come amid heightened tensions following Iran's violent suppression of protests and continued concerns about its nuclear enrichment activities. Oil prices slid more than 2% on Thursday as markets anticipated potential de-escalation from the talks, with Brent crude falling to $67.73 per barrel and WTI dropping to $63.47.

### 5. Philippines and China Trade Barbs as South China Sea Tensions Escalate
*Feb 4*

> The Philippines expressed alarm over escalating verbal confrontations with Chinese diplomats in Manila as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. rejected calls to expel China's ambassador, while Manila pushes to conclude a legally binding South China Sea code of conduct during its ASEAN chairmanship.

The Philippines told China on Monday that it is alarmed about heated exchanges with Chinese diplomats in Manila over the long-standing territorial dispute in the South China Sea, though Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. rejected calls to expel China's ambassador despite furious political reaction to the diplomatic confrontations. The escalation comes against a backdrop of years of raised tensions, as Marcos's strengthening of security ties with the United States has provoked Beijing's ire and the rate of incidents in the disputed waters has accelerated.

As ASEAN chair for 2026, the Philippines has prioritized two parallel initiatives: renewed efforts to finalize a legally binding code of conduct with China and a dramatic expansion of US-Philippines military cooperation, with more than 500 joint activities planned for the year. Analysts note that escalating clashes between the Philippines and China have not only raised the urgency of a regional code of conduct but created a volatile environment where the threshold for war is lowering and red lines are vanishing. The Philippines is adamant that any agreement should be legally binding and monitored by ASEAN-led mechanisms—a stance strongly opposed by China.

The tensions extend beyond diplomatic rhetoric to physical confrontations at sea. China's December military drills around Taiwan covered a larger area than any exercises since 2022, with over 130 aircraft sorties into Taiwan's air defense identification zone, affecting 857 international flights and more than 100,000 travelers. The normalization of People's Liberation Army activity within Taiwan's contiguous zone—the 12-nautical-mile buffer surrounding its territorial waters—marks a subtle but consequential shift that increases the risk of miscalculation across the broader Indo-Pacific region.

### 6. India-US Trade Deal Reaches Final Stage as Jaishankar Concludes Washington Visit
*Feb 5*

> External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that the "historic" India-US trade agreement is in final stages of detailing, signaling a new phase in bilateral ties following President Trump's announcement of reduced tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%.

Following wide-ranging talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington DC, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar stated that the long-awaited India-US trade deal has reached its final stage with only technical and formal work remaining. The announcement came three days after President Trump revealed the reduction of US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% under the trade framework, representing a significant breakthrough after nearly a year of negotiations between the two nations.

The trade deal is expected to open a new phase in bilateral relations marked by expanding cooperation across trade, strategic affairs, defense, energy, and critical minerals. Discussions with Rubio covered multiple pillars of the relationship, with particular emphasis on technology cooperation and defense manufacturing. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, who has been in direct engagement with the US Trade Representative, will detail the formal announcement timelines after several areas have been finalized.

The deal represents a significant development after tensions earlier in 2026 related to trade tariffs, and positions India as a key partner in the Trump administration's effort to diversify supply chains away from China. Critical mineral cooperation between the two nations is also "advancing rapidly," according to Jaishankar, aligning with the broader US strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese mineral supplies. The breakthrough comes as India plans to raise defense spending by 18% in the coming fiscal year, with New Delhi earmarking about 2.2 trillion rupees ($23.9 billion) for defense-related capital spending.

### 7. Egypt and Sudan Reject Unilateral Nile Actions as GERD Tensions Mount
*Feb 3*

> Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers met in Cairo to condemn Ethiopia's unilateral dam operations on the Blue Nile, reaffirming their joint rejection of any actions that could harm downstream nations while calling for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan's ongoing civil war.

Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Sudanese Foreign Minister Mohieddin Salem met in Cairo on Tuesday, explicitly rejecting unilateral measures on the Blue Nile where Ethiopia has built the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)—a project disputed by both downstream nations. Abdelatty also condemned "horrific atrocities and violations" in Sudan's El Fasher and Kordofan regions, calling for an immediate, comprehensive ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access while reaffirming Egypt's rejection of any attempts to partition Sudan.

The tensions relate to rising Nile floods that have reignited disputes over the GERD, with accusations of uncoordinated dam releases and climate impacts heightening regional water conflicts. Ethiopia's fourth filling of the dam trapped nearly 24 billion cubic meters of water in its reservoir—a move Cairo has condemned as "irresponsible" and a direct threat to its national security. Over the past decade, talks over the dam led by the African Union, European Union, and United States have failed to produce a binding agreement, with Ethiopia preferring a flexible and sovereign approach while Egypt insists on fixed legal guarantees.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Sudan's Abdel Fattah al-Burhan met in Cairo last week, agreeing to enhance coordination on water security and establish new communication channels to anticipate sudden flood events. The fundamental dispute remains unresolved, with the dam now operational and Egypt heavily dependent on the Nile for its water needs. Analysts warn that population growth and climate change could intensify GERD tensions, urging pragmatic cooperation across the Nile Basin before the situation deteriorates further.

### 8. Poland Accelerates Eastern Border Fortification Amid Belarus Hybrid Warfare
*Feb 4*

> Poland announced plans to secure 200 kilometers of its eastern border by year-end 2026 and closed ten crossings with Russia and Belarus, as Warsaw invests heavily in anti-drone systems and surveillance capabilities to counter ongoing hybrid warfare tactics.

Poland has already secured 60 kilometers of its eastern border and plans to expand fortifications to more than 200 kilometers by year-end 2026, accelerating a military engineering program designed to harden the frontier with Belarus and Russia. Effective January 6, 2026, Poland shut ten road, rail, and pedestrian crossings with Russia's Kaliningrad region and Belarus, citing security risks linked to irregular migration orchestrated by Minsk. The border closures and fortification efforts reflect Warsaw's determination to counter what it describes as systematic hybrid warfare from its eastern neighbors.

The tensions stem from multiple factors: a migration crisis that Poland accuses Belarus of instrumentalizing, the presence of thousands of Russian Wagner mercenaries in Belarus who have reportedly conducted training near the border, and Moscow's deployment of short-range nuclear weapons into Belarus near the NATO frontier. Poland is investing heavily in modern surveillance and strike capabilities, including anti-aircraft and counter-drone systems, unmanned aerial platforms, mine-laying vehicles, and reconnaissance assets. The country is set to receive nearly €44 billion from the EU's €150 billion SAFE facility to finance more than 130 defense projects.

The border fortification comes as part of the broader EU ReArm Europe plan, which aims to mobilize €800 billion across member states to boost defense spending. Poland, Baltic states, and Finland have warned they could fully seal borders with Belarus if military and migrant tensions grow further. In October 2024, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a temporary suspension of the right to asylum in Poland, a decision supported by 386 out of 460 members of parliament—reflecting the political consensus around border security even as human rights groups warn of humanitarian consequences for migrants trapped between borders.

### 9. Pakistan Boycotts India at T20 World Cup in Show of Solidarity with Bangladesh
*Feb 5*

> Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed Pakistan will boycott its scheduled match against India at the T20 World Cup 2026 in solidarity with Bangladesh, which was removed from the tournament amid disputes over hosting arrangements under the India-Sri Lanka hybrid model.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced that Pakistan's decision to boycott the game against India at the men's T20 World Cup 2026 was a show of solidarity with Bangladesh, which was removed from the tournament and replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh's ouster followed disputes related to hosting arrangements, security concerns, and scheduling under the hybrid model involving India and Sri Lanka—a decision that triggered widespread criticism over what was described as inconsistent treatment by the International Cricket Council (ICC).

The boycott represents a dramatic escalation in cricket diplomacy between the nuclear-armed rivals, with the ICC now engaged in back-channel talks with Pakistan to salvage the fixture. Pakistan had expressed solidarity with Bangladesh earlier in the row, and Sharif's announcement formalized what had been building tension between Islamabad and cricket's governing body. The development comes against a backdrop of warming Pakistan-Bangladesh ties, with the two nations resuming direct trade for the first time since the 1971 war under an agreement negotiated by Bangladesh's interim government.

An unexpected handshake between India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar and Pakistan's National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq in Dhaka in late December 2025—ahead of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's funeral—had prompted speculation about whether India and Pakistan might cautiously restart dialogue in 2026. However, the cricket boycott suggests any diplomatic thaw remains distant. Pakistan's growing footprint in Bangladesh has raised alarm bells in New Delhi, with analysts noting that Islamabad's engagement with Dhaka's interim government under Muhammad Yunus has accelerated considerably since the August 2024 political transition.

### 10. Houthis Signal End to Red Sea Shipping Attacks as Industry Eyes Cautious Return
*Feb 4*

> The Houthi leadership declared an end to their campaign against maritime interests connected to Israel following a US-Houthi ceasefire mediated by Oman in May, with shipping analysts predicting 2026 could mark the large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea route.

The Houthi leadership in Yemen has declared they will bring an end to their campaign against maritime interests connected to Israel, following the US-Houthi ceasefire mediated by Oman in May 2025. Since the ceasefire, Houthi attacks on shipping were theoretically limited to vessels with links to Israel, though the broader Red Sea shipping crisis that began in late 2023 had disrupted global trade routes and forced major carriers to divert around Africa's Cape of Good Hope at significant additional cost and time.

Analysts at Xeneta and other maritime consultancies suggest 2026 could mark the year container ships make a large-scale return to the Red Sea, with the prime window for route adjustment coming immediately after Lunar New Year in mid-February. However, shipping carriers and insurers remain highly cautious, demanding significant and sustained assurances of safety beyond Houthi statements before committing to a full return. The Red Sea crisis had added approximately $7-8 per barrel in geopolitical risk premium to oil prices at its peak.

The potential return to normalcy would represent a significant shift for global logistics, as the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal cuts thousands of miles off voyages between Asia and Europe. The crisis had forced nearly all major shipping lines to avoid the region, increasing freight costs and delivery times across global supply chains. However, experts caution that it will take time to bring back "normality" to the region, with the security situation requiring sustained improvement before commercial operations fully resume.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Alphabet Announces $185 Billion AI Spending Plan as Q4 Beats Expectations
*Feb 4*

> Google's parent company reported record Q4 revenue of $113.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, but shares slipped after projecting 2026 capital expenditures of up to $185 billion—more than double 2025's spend—as the company goes all-in on AI infrastructure.

Alphabet delivered fourth quarter revenue of $113.8 billion, beating analyst expectations while reporting earnings per share of $2.82, a 31% year-over-year increase that also topped the $2.63 consensus estimate. For the full year, Alphabet topped $400 billion in revenue for the first time, with net income climbing 30% to $34.5 billion. Google Cloud beat Wall Street's expectations with nearly 48% revenue growth from a year ago, and its backlog more than doubled year-over-year to reach $240 billion at quarter's end.

However, the company's outlook for 2026 capital expenditures spooked investors, with Alphabet projecting spend in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion—the top end of which would be more than double its $91.4 billion investment in 2025. The spending will ramp through the year as the company invests in AI compute capacity for DeepMind, Search and ads improvements, Cloud demand, and Other Bets. Shares slipped 0.8% by market close despite the earnings beat, reflecting investor concern about the aggressive spending trajectory.

CEO Sundar Pichai reported that Gemini AI now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter, while the company achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations and efficiency improvements. The results set the tone for a brutal trading session on Thursday, with the broader market selling off on concerns about AI spending sustainability across the technology sector.

### 2. Qualcomm Plunges 11% on Weak Guidance as Global Memory Shortage Bites
*Feb 5*

> Chipmaker Qualcomm reported fiscal Q1 earnings that beat expectations but shares crashed after issuing disappointing Q2 guidance, with CEO Cristiano Amon attributing the cautious outlook to a global memory shortage constraining the handset business through at least fiscal 2027.

Qualcomm shares plummeted nearly 11% in premarket trading Thursday after the semiconductor giant's disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter overshadowed a strong Q1 earnings beat. The company reported $3.50 EPS for the quarter, topping analysts' consensus of $3.38, with revenue of $12.25 billion slightly exceeding the $12.16 billion estimate. However, Q2 2026 guidance of $10.2 billion to $11 billion in revenue and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.65 fell significantly short of analyst expectations for $11.02 billion and $2.87 respectively.

CEO Cristiano Amon attributed the cautious outlook to ongoing global memory shortages that are constraining the handset business, as smartphone customers adjust their inventories and purchase decisions amid supply constraints. Qualcomm executives indicated the memory supply shortage could last through the entire current fiscal year, potentially dragging supply pressures into calendar year 2027. The warning added to concerns about supply chain fragility across the semiconductor sector.

Multiple analysts lowered their price targets following the report, with the stock closing Thursday at $132.49, down from $148.89 the prior day. The selloff contributed to the broader tech rout that pushed the Nasdaq down 1.59% and sent the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year. Qualcomm's guidance miss highlights the uneven nature of the AI-driven semiconductor boom, with companies closest to AI compute benefiting while those in adjacent markets face continued headwinds.

### 3. Amazon Stock Crashes 10% After Announcing $200 Billion 2026 Spending Plan
*Feb 5*

> Amazon reported Q4 revenue of $213.39 billion and AWS cloud growth of 24%—its fastest in 13 quarters—but shares plunged in extended trading after the company boosted its 2026 capital expenditure forecast to $200 billion, far exceeding the $146.6 billion analysts expected.

Amazon delivered mixed fourth-quarter results after market close Thursday, with revenue of $213.39 billion up 14% year-over-year and beating the $211.30 billion consensus, while earnings per share of $1.95 slightly missed the $1.97 estimate. The clear highlight was AWS, which expanded 24% during the quarter—its fastest growth in 13 quarters—with revenue of $35.58 billion topping analyst expectations of $34.93 billion. AWS operating income reached $12.47 billion with margins widening to 35%.

However, Amazon shares plunged more than 10% in extended trading after the company announced 2026 capital expenditure plans of $200 billion, dramatically exceeding the $146.6 billion analysts had expected. The spending surge reflects Amazon's commitment to AI infrastructure buildout, with CEO Andy Jassy citing the need to invest in AI compute capacity to meet surging demand. The announcement came as Amazon confirmed plans to eliminate 16,000 corporate roles—the largest workforce reduction in company history—bringing its four-month layoff total to 30,000.

The earnings report caps a challenging period for Amazon investors, with the company caught between the imperative to invest massively in AI infrastructure and pressure to demonstrate profitability improvements. The spending forecast aligns with similar aggressive AI investment announcements from Microsoft and Alphabet this earnings season, but Amazon's guidance was the most dramatic departure from expectations. Analysts will closely watch whether the AI investments translate into revenue growth or become a drag on margins.

### 4. Strategy (MicroStrategy) Plunges 17% After Reporting $12.4 Billion Net Loss
*Feb 5*

> Michael Saylor's crypto-focused company reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion and net loss of $12.4 billion for Q4 2025 as Bitcoin's extended decline crushed the value of its 713,502 Bitcoin holdings, sending shares to their lowest level since early 2024.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) reported dismal Q4 2025 results on Thursday, with an operating loss of $17.4 billion compared to $1 billion in Q4 2024, and a net loss of $12.4 billion, or $42.93 per share—far exceeding the $670.8 million loss in the year-ago quarter. Total revenues came in at just $123 million with gross profit of $81.3 million, as the company's core software business continues to shrink while its identity as a Bitcoin holding company faces its most severe test.

The company holds 713,502 Bitcoin acquired at a total cost of $54.26 billion, or $76,052 per coin, but with Bitcoin trading below $70,000 on Thursday, Strategy faces $24.3 billion in implied unrealized losses on its crypto holdings. The stock closed at $106.99, down 17% on the day and 71.8% below its 52-week high of $457.22 reached in July 2025. Strategy's shares have dropped 67% over the past year as Bitcoin's extended bear market has decimated the premium investors were willing to pay for leveraged crypto exposure.

Michael Saylor's bet-the-company strategy on Bitcoin has faced increasing scrutiny as the cryptocurrency has fallen nearly 50% from its October 2024 peak near $126,000. The company's convertible debt structure and continued Bitcoin purchases through the downturn have raised concerns about its ability to withstand a prolonged crypto winter. Thursday's results illustrated the extreme volatility inherent in Saylor's approach, with the magnitude of losses dwarfing the company's underlying software operations.

### 5. January Layoffs Hit Highest Level Since 2009 as Amazon and UPS Lead Cuts
*Feb 5*

> US employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January—the highest for any January since 2009—while hiring intentions reached their lowest since the same period, with Amazon's 16,000-job cut and UPS's 30,000-position elimination accounting for 40% of the total.

The Challenger, Gray & Christmas report revealed that US employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025—marking the highest January total since the depths of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Hiring announcements were equally grim, with companies announcing just 5,306 new hires, the lowest January figure since 2009. Andy Challenger, the firm's chief revenue officer, stated the data signals employers are "less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026."

About 40% of January's layoff announcements came from just two companies: Amazon, which outlined plans for 16,000 corporate job cuts as part of an AI restructuring, and UPS, which announced 30,000 positions will be eliminated as it winds down its partnership with Amazon. The UPS cuts are part of the company's pivot from Amazon shipments to higher-margin customers, with the company expecting $3 billion in savings from network optimization. Amazon's reductions, the largest in company history, bring its four-month layoff total to 30,000.

The biggest reasons cited for January's planned cutbacks were contract loss (30,784—primarily attributed to UPS) and market and economic conditions (28,392). The data painted a picture of an increasingly stressed labor market, with CNN reporting the job market was already "slim pickings" before the new data made it worse. The January jobs report, which would normally provide additional color on labor market conditions, remains delayed indefinitely due to data collection issues stemming from the recent government shutdown.

### 6. Bitcoin Crashes Below $70,000 to 15-Month Low as Crypto Rout Deepens
*Feb 5*

> Bitcoin plunged below $70,000 for the first time in 15 months, falling more than 10% in 24 hours as Treasury Secretary Bessent confirmed no federal authority to stabilize crypto markets, triggering $2.58 billion in liquidations and dragging down shares of Coinbase, Circle, and Robinhood.

Bitcoin crashed below $70,000 on Thursday for the first time since November 2024, with the world's largest cryptocurrency falling more than 10% in 24 hours to touch lows near $64,000—a level not seen since October 2024. The decline represents a 44% fall from Bitcoin's October 2024 peak near $126,000, with cumulative liquidations topping $16 billion over the past 10 days. In the last 24 hours alone, over $2.58 billion in long positions were wiped out as leveraged traders capitulated.

The immediate trigger came from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, where he stated that the Treasury has no authority to stabilize crypto markets—dashing hopes among some crypto advocates that the Trump administration might intervene to support digital asset prices. Bitcoin ETFs have also underperformed expectations, with institutional investment declining in recent months and reducing trade volumes. Glassnode analysts recorded the second-largest investor capitulation in two years.

Crypto-related stocks followed Bitcoin lower, with Coinbase dropping to $166 (down 62% from its all-time high), while Circle and Robinhood also declined sharply. The Fear and Greed Index, which reflects investor sentiment, stands at 12 points—indicating "extreme fear" among traders. Analysts noted that Bitcoin has been swept up in broader "risk-off" sentiment flowing through markets, with the cryptocurrency offering no haven from volatility despite years of narrative around its supposed uncorrelated returns.

### 7. Peloton Crashes 26% After AI Hardware Bet Backfires
*Feb 5*

> Peloton shares plunged after reporting Q2 fiscal 2026 revenue down 3% year-over-year as its AI-powered hardware refresh—featuring swivel screens and real-time form correction—failed to convince existing users to upgrade, prompting the company to slash full-year guidance and announce CFO departure.

Peloton shares crashed 26% after the fitness equipment company reported a worse-than-expected holiday quarter, with sales falling to $656.5 million—down about 3% from $673.9 million a year earlier. The company's Q2 2026 earnings revealed that its Cross Training hardware refresh, featuring swivel screens, 360-degree cameras, and real-time AI form correction, failed to drive the upgrade cycle management had anticipated. Hardware sales of $244 million and subscription revenue of $413 million both missed expectations.

The core problem, management acknowledged, was overestimating the rate at which existing members would upgrade their equipment. The revamped product lineup included artificial intelligence-powered tracking cameras, hands-free control, and enhanced speakers, but shoppers failed to embrace the higher price points during the holiday season. CFO Liz Coddington announced she is leaving Peloton and will stay through March as the company searches for its next finance chief.

Peloton slashed its full-year revenue guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.44 billion, with Q3 guidance of $605 million to $625 million coming in well below the $637 million analyst estimate. The company's shares closed at $4.39, with some analysts questioning whether Peloton has become a "zombie stock"—dead but not yet aware of it. The failure of the AI hardware strategy represents a significant setback for a company that had positioned the technology refresh as its path back to growth after years of post-pandemic decline.

### 8. Tech Selloff Sends S&P 500 Negative for 2026 as Dow Drops 593 Points
*Feb 5*

> US equities experienced their worst day in months as the S&P 500 lost 1.23% and turned negative for the year, the Dow shed 593 points, and the Nasdaq declined 1.59%, driven by concerns over AI spending sustainability and dismal labor market data.

US markets suffered a broad selloff Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 592.58 points (1.20%) to close at 48,908.72, while the S&P 500 lost 1.23% to finish at 6,798.40—pushing the benchmark index into negative territory for 2026. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.59% to 22,540.59, with technology stocks bearing the brunt of selling pressure as investors questioned the sustainability of massive AI spending plans announced by tech giants this earnings season.

The selloff was driven by multiple factors: Alphabet's announcement of up to $185 billion in 2026 capital expenditures, Qualcomm's weak forward guidance due to memory shortages, and the Challenger report showing January layoffs at their highest level since 2009. Amazon's after-hours announcement of $200 billion in 2026 spending suggested the selling pressure would continue. Popular trades in technology and Bitcoin unraveled simultaneously as investors adopted a risk-off stance.

Traders are now eyeing key support levels as the rout deepens, with Bloomberg noting that bottom-fishers are searching for clues on where the selloff may end. The rotation out of technology accelerated, with healthcare and consumer staples providing relative safety. Amgen surged 8.2% on positive earnings, Eli Lilly jumped 10.3%, and healthcare distributor McKesson soared 16.5%—but these gains were overshadowed by the carnage in tech names that have led the market for years.

### 9. McKesson Soars 16.5% on Earnings Beat and European Divestiture
*Feb 5*

> Healthcare distributor McKesson surged after reporting Q3 2026 results with EPS of $9.34 beating estimates, raising full-year guidance to $38.80-$39.20 per share, and completing its strategic exit from Europe through the sale of its Norway businesses to NorgesGruppen.

McKesson Corporation shares soared 16.5% on Thursday, opening at $862 and climbing nearly $100 throughout the day to close at $959.31 after the healthcare distributor reported strong fiscal third-quarter 2026 results. The company delivered EPS of $9.34, topping the consensus estimate of $9.19, with total revenue of $106.2 billion representing an 11.4% year-over-year increase. McKesson raised its full-year EPS guidance to $38.80-$39.20, surpassing analyst expectations.

The earnings beat was accompanied by the completion of McKesson's divestiture of its businesses in Norway to NorgesGruppen, marking the company's strategic exit from Europe. The move allows McKesson to focus on major growth areas including Oncology and Biopharma, where management sees significant opportunities for margin expansion. Morgan Stanley raised its price target for the company, predicting shares could reach as high as $966.

McKesson's surge provided a bright spot in an otherwise brutal trading session for the broader market, with healthcare stocks offering a safe haven as technology names cratered. The company's focus on high-margin specialty distribution, particularly in oncology, positions it to benefit from the continued growth in cancer treatments and biosimilars. The European exit also removes currency exposure and allows management to concentrate capital on the US market, where pharmaceutical distribution remains highly consolidated and profitable.

### 10. Oil Prices Slide 2% as US-Iran Talks Ease Supply Disruption Fears
*Feb 5*

> Brent crude fell to $67.73 and WTI dropped to $63.47 after Iran and the US confirmed nuclear talks will proceed Friday in Oman, reversing a 3% surge from the prior session when reports suggested negotiations might collapse.

Oil prices fell more than 2% on Thursday after the US and Iran confirmed nuclear talks will proceed in Oman on Friday, with Brent crude futures dropping to $67.73 per barrel and US West Texas Intermediate crude declining to $63.47. The slide erased gains from Wednesday, when prices had surged about 3% on media reports suggesting the planned talks could collapse. Analysts estimate the "geopolitical risk premium" has been adding roughly $7-8 to every barrel of oil, reflecting heightened tensions in the oil-rich Middle East region.

The talks face significant uncertainty over their scope, with Iran seeking to limit discussions strictly to its nuclear program while the US wants to include ballistic missiles, regional proxy groups, and treatment of Iranian citizens during the ongoing protest crackdown. The venue shifted to Oman after the original Turkey location nearly collapsed over format disagreements. A successful de-escalation could eventually bring additional Iranian barrels to market, further pressuring prices already weighed down by expectations of 2026 global oil surplus.

Meanwhile, API data showed US crude inventories fell by 11.1 million barrels last week—vastly exceeding expectations of a 0.7 million barrel build and representing the largest draw since June. The surprising drawdown signals tighter domestic supply conditions than anticipated, providing a bullish counterweight to the bearish structural outlook. OPEC+ has reaffirmed plans to keep production unchanged in March, maintaining ample global supply conditions as the cartel monitors the impact of US-Iran negotiations on market dynamics.
