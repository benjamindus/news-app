### 1. Suicide Bombing at Islamabad Mosque Kills 31 During Friday Prayers
*Feb 6*

> A suicide bomber detonated explosives at a Shia mosque in Islamabad's Tarlai Kalan area during Friday prayers, killing at least 31 worshippers and wounding 169 others in the deadliest attack on the Pakistani capital since 2008.

The explosion struck the Khadija Tul Kubra Mosque during Friday prayers, with security guards attempting to intercept the suspect before he opened fire and detonated his explosives among worshippers. Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif alleged the attacker had been traveling to and from Afghanistan, though investigations are ongoing. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, though early investigations had pointed to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which subsequently denied any connection.

The attack represents a dramatic escalation of violence in Pakistan's capital, which had been relatively insulated from the militant attacks plaguing other parts of the country. The last major attack in Islamabad was the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing that killed 63 people and wounded over 250. The targeting of a Shia mosque during prayers follows a pattern of sectarian violence that has claimed thousands of lives in Pakistan over the past two decades.

The bombing comes as Pakistan grapples with a broader surge in militant violence following mass attacks in Balochistan that killed over 225 people last month. The government has launched Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a major counterterrorism campaign, but the Islamabad attack demonstrates the persistent security challenges facing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's administration. Security forces have been deployed across the capital as authorities investigate the network behind the attack.

### 2. US and Russia Restore Military-to-Military Dialogue After Abu Dhabi Talks
*Feb 6*

> The United States and Russia agreed to reestablish high-level military communication channels for the first time since late 2021, marking a significant thaw in relations following the second round of Ukraine peace talks in Abu Dhabi.

The announcement came at the conclusion of two days of US-brokered negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in the United Arab Emirates. White House special envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed that the restored communication channel will "provide consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace." The development represents the most significant diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Moscow since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Beyond the military dialogue agreement, the talks produced a prisoner exchange with Ukraine and Russia each releasing 157 prisoners of war—the first such swap in five months. However, substantive progress on core issues including territorial arrangements and a ceasefire remained elusive. Witkoff acknowledged that "greater efforts would be required to advance a comprehensive settlement of the conflict," with key differences over Ukraine's NATO aspirations and the status of Russian-occupied territories remaining unresolved.

The resumption of military contacts addresses one of the most dangerous aspects of the US-Russia breakdown—the absence of direct communication channels that could prevent miscalculation between nuclear powers. European allies have expressed cautious optimism about the talks while emphasizing the need for continued support to Ukraine. The next round of negotiations has not yet been scheduled, though both sides indicated willingness to continue the dialogue.

### 3. US-Iran Nuclear Talks End in Oman with Both Sides Claiming Progress
*Feb 6*

> Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the indirect nuclear negotiations in Muscat as "a good start" after Oman mediated between US and Iranian delegations, though no concrete roadmap emerged to alleviate fears of potential military confrontation.

Iran's negotiating team, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, engaged in indirect talks with a US delegation that included special envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and Central Command chief Brad Cooper—the most senior US military commander in the region. Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi shuttled between the two sides throughout Friday, conveying messages and clarifying positions. The talks were described as useful for understanding both sides' thinking and identifying areas for possible progress.

The negotiations took place against a backdrop of heightened military tension, with the USS Abraham Lincoln supercarrier positioned near Iranian waters and the US strengthening air defenses at bases across the region. President Trump had issued blunt warnings to Iran's leadership ahead of the talks, while Tehran maintained it was "ready to respond to any US attack." The oil-rich Middle East remains on edge as markets attempt to price in the probability of conflict versus diplomatic resolution.

Iran sought to limit discussions strictly to its nuclear program, while Washington pushed to include ballistic missiles, regional proxy groups, and human rights concerns related to the ongoing crackdown on protests that has killed over 6,400 people. The format differences that nearly derailed the talks in Turkey were navigated through Oman's mediation, with Araghchi stating the talks are "on hold for now" while both sides assess next steps. No date has been set for a follow-up round.

### 4. South Africa Signs Trade Framework with China as Trump Tariffs Strain US Relations
*Feb 6*

> China and South Africa signed a framework agreement that would give South African goods duty-free access to Chinese markets, as Africa's largest economy seeks alternatives following 30% US tariffs and a diplomatic fallout with the Trump administration.

The agreement, announced Friday in Pretoria, would start negotiations over a deal covering South African exports such as fruit while giving China enhanced investment opportunities, particularly in the automotive sector where Chinese car sales have grown rapidly. South Africa's trade ministry said it expected the deal to be finalized by the end of March, marking a significant pivot in the country's trade relationships.

The move comes as US-South Africa diplomatic ties have plunged to their worst point in decades. The Trump administration has accused South Africa of pursuing an anti-American foreign policy and allowing what it describes as the violent persecution of a white minority group. Beyond the 30% reciprocal tariffs on South African goods, Trump has barred South Africa from participating in Group of 20 meetings in the United States this year, further isolating Pretoria from traditional Western partners.

The framework represents a broader realignment as developing nations seek to diversify trade relationships amid the US tariff regime. China has been actively courting countries facing high US duties, offering alternative market access and investment. For South Africa, the deal provides potential relief from the economic impact of US tariffs while deepening ties with Beijing—a calculation being made by an increasing number of nations navigating the new trade landscape.

### 5. Turkey and Israel Clash Over Competing Visions for Post-Assad Syria
*Feb 6*

> Tensions between Ankara and Tel Aviv have escalated sharply over Syria's future, with Israel conducting nearly 1,000 airstrikes since Assad's fall while Turkey supports a strong centralized Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa.

In the first seven months following Assad's collapse in late 2024, Israel conducted 988 air and artillery strikes—nearly triple the 334 airstrikes carried out over the previous seven years. Turkish officials have condemned the attacks as destabilizing, arguing that Israel seeks to ensure Syria remains weak and fragmented. Turkey views the regime's fall as an opportunity to foster stability through a strong, centralized Syrian state allied with Ankara.

The rivalry has created a volatile security environment for Syria's transitional government. President al-Sharaa, who became the first Syrian leader to visit the White House since independence, faces the challenge of asserting sovereignty while foreign powers pursue competing interests on Syrian territory. Serious clashes continue with minorities, notably Druze and Alawites, further complicating the consolidation of central authority.

The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed to incorporate its governance and military apparatus into Syrian state institutions, with Kurdish leader Nour al-Din Issa Ahmad appointed as governor of Al-Hasakah Governorate. However, key details remain unresolved, and analysts warn that without progress in talks, Damascus could attempt to take SDF-held areas by force. The situation in Syria remains one of the most complex geopolitical challenges of 2026, with regional powers jockeying for influence in the post-Assad order.

### 6. Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti Hold Trilateral Summit Amid Port Deal Tensions
*Feb 6*

> Presidents Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia and Ismaïl Omar Guelleh of Djibouti met with Ethiopian leaders in Jigjiga for trilateral talks focused on economic integration and security cooperation, even as the Ethiopia-Somaliland port dispute remains unresolved.

The summit brought together the three Horn of Africa leaders to discuss cooperation on shared regional priorities including infrastructure, connectivity, and counter-terrorism coordination. Ethiopia is positioning renewable electricity exports at the center of regional transformation, with the 120-megawatt Aysha II Wind Project near the Djibouti border inaugurated during the meetings as a symbol of energy integration efforts.

However, significant tensions persist between Ethiopia and Somalia over the Memorandum of Understanding Addis Ababa signed with Somaliland in January granting Ethiopia access to a Red Sea port. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its sovereign territory and has demanded Ethiopia withdraw from the agreement. Two rounds of Turkey-mediated talks between the two nations in 2025 failed to resolve the dispute, leaving relations strained despite the trilateral engagement.

The US military signaled deeper security and economic engagement with East Africa during recent visits to Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti by AFRICOM leadership. The broader strategy aims to address growing security threats while competing with Chinese and Russian influence in the strategic region. The trilateral summit, despite its focus on cooperation, underscores the complex web of alliances and disputes that characterize Horn of Africa geopolitics.

### 7. Philippines Pushes for Binding South China Sea Code of Conduct During ASEAN Chair
*Feb 6*

> As ASEAN chairman for 2026, the Philippines announced monthly working group meetings aimed at concluding negotiations on a legally binding South China Sea code of conduct with China before year-end.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has made the code of conduct a centerpiece of Manila's ASEAN chairmanship, convening regular working-level meetings to maintain momentum in talks that have dragged on for over two decades. The Philippines is adamant that any agreement should be legally binding and monitored by ASEAN-led mechanisms—a stance strongly opposed by China, which prefers a more flexible arrangement that preserves its expansive territorial claims.

The diplomatic push comes alongside a dramatic expansion of US-Philippines military cooperation, with more than 500 joint activities planned for 2026. Marcos has strengthened security ties with Washington while attempting to manage tensions with Beijing, though the rate of incidents in disputed waters has accelerated. Analysts note that escalating clashes have not only raised the urgency of a regional code of conduct but created a volatile environment where the threshold for conflict is lowering.

China has responded to the Philippines' pro-US tilt with increasingly assertive behavior in the South China Sea. Beijing maintains that bilateral negotiations rather than multilateral frameworks should govern maritime disputes, rejecting the 2016 international arbitral ruling that invalidated most of China's claims. The ASEAN chairmanship gives Manila a platform to advance its preferred approach, though success will require navigating significant resistance from Beijing.

### 8. Supreme Court Delays Ruling on Trump IEEPA Tariffs Until February 20
*Feb 6*

> The Supreme Court did not issue its highly anticipated ruling on the legality of Trump's emergency tariffs before a month-long recess, leaving $195 billion in collected duties in limbo and potential refunds hanging on the February 20 decision.

The case will determine two critical issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy tariffs, and whether the US must reimburse importers who have already paid the duties. Tariffs collected under IEEPA brought in approximately $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion so far in 2026, according to Treasury data.

The stakes extend beyond refunds to the entire US trade policy framework. If the Supreme Court rules the IEEPA tariffs unconstitutional, the Trump administration has indicated it has backup plans using other legal authorities including Sections 122, 338, 301, and 232. However, analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics note that each alternative statute is either narrow, temporary, or specific—none can recreate the across-the-board tariff wall enabled by IEEPA.

The customs bond market has ballooned alongside the tariffs, with billions of dollars in collateral posted by importers now contingent on the court's decision. Businesses have been stockpiling goods ahead of potential tariff increases while simultaneously planning for possible refunds, creating significant uncertainty across supply chains. The delay adds another three weeks of limbo for companies trying to plan around the unpredictable trade environment.

### 9. NATO Wargame Reveals Defense Readiness Gaps as Europe Prepares for Reduced US Role
*Feb 6*

> A major NATO military exercise exposed significant capability gaps in European defense readiness as the 2026 National Defense Strategy formalized US expectations that Europe take primary responsibility for conventional defense against Russia.

The exercise, conducted across NATO's eastern flank, tested alliance responses to various threat scenarios and highlighted shortfalls in ammunition stocks, air defense coverage, and rapid deployment capabilities. The findings underscore the urgency of European defense spending increases as the US pivots its conventional force posture toward the Indo-Pacific theater. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has emphasized that Europe can no longer rely on the US to underwrite its conventional defense.

The 2026 National Defense Strategy continues a "one plus" conflict approach with a significant change: if the United States is involved in a conflict with China, the defense of Europe against any Russian aggression will be NATO's responsibility. Washington will retain its nuclear deterrent role and provide high-end enablers but will no longer underwrite Europe's conventional defense by default. The shift has accelerated European defense investments, with the EU's ReArm Europe plan aiming to mobilize €800 billion across member states.

Experts identify a ceasefire in Ukraine on Russia's terms as a top-tier risk for European security, rating it high in both likelihood and impact. Russia is expected to step up its shadow war on Europe through infrastructure attacks and democracy disruption. The wargame results are being used to prioritize defense investments, with particular focus on air defense systems, long-range strike capabilities, and logistics infrastructure across NATO's eastern member states.

### 10. Colombia's Petro Meets Trump Amid Drug Trafficking Tensions
*Feb 6*

> Colombian President Gustavo Petro traveled to Washington for talks with President Trump as the two nations navigate tensions over drug trafficking policy and regional fallout from the January capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The meeting comes weeks after Trump's January 3 military strike in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of Maduro—an action that sent shockwaves through Latin America. Colombian President Petro, along with Brazilian President Lula da Silva and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, had condemned the US intervention as crossing "an unacceptable line." The face-to-face meeting aims to stabilize bilateral relations strained by both the Venezuela situation and disagreements over counter-narcotics strategy.

Colombia remains the world's largest cocaine producer, and the Trump administration has pressed Bogotá for more aggressive eradication and interdiction measures. Petro has championed a harm-reduction approach that emphasizes addressing demand and providing alternatives for coca farmers, creating friction with Washington's enforcement-focused preferences. The talks are expected to address both policy differences and potential areas of cooperation.

The broader regional context adds complexity to the discussions. Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodríguez has moved to privatize the country's oil industry, potentially opening opportunities for US companies but also creating new dynamics along Colombia's border with its neighbor. The Petro-Trump meeting represents an effort to manage disagreements while maintaining cooperation on security issues that affect both nations.

## Financial News (Top 10)

### 1. Dow Jones Crosses 50,000 for First Time as Markets Stage Historic Rebound
*Feb 6*

> The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,207 points to close above 50,000 for the first time in history, with the S&P 500 jumping 2% and the Nasdaq advancing 2.2% as technology stocks recovered from their worst rout in months.

The blue-chip index closed at 50,115.67, gaining 2.47% in its biggest single-day point gain of 2026. The rally represented a dramatic reversal from Thursday's selloff, with investor sentiment stabilizing after days of heavy selling in the technology sector. Nvidia led the recovery with a 7.4% surge, contributing nearly 200 points to the Dow's total gain, while Microsoft jumped 4% on strong Azure cloud performance.

The rebound came as Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX, dropped back below 20 after spiking earlier in the week during the tech selloff. Consumer sentiment data provided additional support, with the University of Michigan survey showing a headline reading of 57.3—better than the 55.0 consensus estimate—while near-term inflation expectations fell to 3.5% from 4%, the lowest since January 2025.

Caterpillar emerged as a standout performer, hitting an all-time high of $723.32 as the industrial giant reported strong demand for its AI-powered autonomous mining and construction equipment. The company's record backlog and exposure to data center power generation positioned it as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout. The Dow milestone marks the index's fastest 5,000-point climb since reaching 45,000 in December 2024.

### 2. Amazon Plunges 8% as $200 Billion AI Spending Plan Spooks Investors
*Feb 6*

> Amazon shares dropped sharply Friday after the e-commerce giant announced plans to spend approximately $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2026—roughly one-third higher than Wall Street had forecast—primarily to expand cloud and AI infrastructure.

The company had reported mixed Q4 results after Thursday's close, with revenue of $213.4 billion exceeding forecasts while earnings per share of $1.95 missed the $1.98 estimate. AWS cloud growth of 24% was the fastest in 13 quarters, but investors focused on the aggressive spending outlook rather than operational performance. The stock opened sharply lower and remained under pressure throughout Friday's session despite the broader market rally.

The magnitude of Amazon's capex guidance—roughly $54 billion above analyst expectations—crystallized concerns that have haunted technology investors throughout earnings season. Alphabet's $185 billion spending plan and Microsoft's $80 billion commitment have already raised questions about the return on massive AI investments. Amazon's announcement suggested the spending race shows no signs of slowing, with unclear timelines for when these investments will translate into proportionate revenue growth.

The reaction underscored a growing divide in investor sentiment between companies benefiting from AI spending (like Nvidia and Caterpillar) and those doing the spending. CEO Andy Jassy defended the investments as necessary to meet surging demand for AI compute capacity, but the stock's decline reflected skepticism about near-term margin pressures. The contrast with the broader market rally highlighted the rotation within technology away from AI infrastructure investors toward infrastructure beneficiaries.

### 3. Bitcoin Crashes to 15-Month Low Near $60,000 as Crypto Rout Continues
*Feb 6*

> Bitcoin plunged as low as $60,033 in Friday's Asian trading session before stabilizing around $64,500, extending a selloff that has erased nearly 50% from October's record high and triggered over $1 billion in liquidations in 24 hours.

The world's largest cryptocurrency has now fallen approximately 50% from its peak of $126,272 reached in October 2025, with the decline wiping out all gains since President Trump's election victory had triggered a speculative rush into digital assets. More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, including about $980 million in bullish leveraged bets forced to close as prices dropped.

The decline accelerated after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the government has no authority to stabilize crypto markets, dashing hopes among some advocates that the Trump administration might intervene. Institutional outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued, with investment declining in recent months and reducing trade volumes. Glassnode analysts recorded the second-largest investor capitulation in two years.

Friday's partial stabilization came as the broader risk-on sentiment lifted most asset classes, with Bitcoin recovering from its lows alongside the equity rally. However, the cryptocurrency's correlation with technology stocks has left it vulnerable to the broader rotation out of risk assets. The Fear and Greed Index stands at 12 points—indicating "extreme fear"—as traders debate whether the flush represents capitulation or a pause before further decline.

### 4. UBS Posts Strong Earnings but Stock Slides 5% on US Wealth Outflows
*Feb 6*

> Swiss banking giant UBS reported Q4 net profit of $1.2 billion—up 56% year-over-year—and announced a $3 billion share buyback for 2026, but shares dropped after revealing client outflows from its US wealth management division.

The bank delivered full-year net profit of $7.8 billion, up 53% from 2024, with group invested assets exceeding $7 trillion for the first time. UBS raised its dividend 22% to $1.10 per share and set ambitious 2028 targets including an 18% return on CET1 capital and a 67% cost-to-income ratio. The results demonstrated continued progress in integrating Credit Suisse, acquired in 2023's emergency rescue.

However, investors focused on concerning trends in the US wealth management business, where client outflows raised questions about UBS's ability to compete for high-net-worth Americans amid a crowded competitive landscape. The stock dropped 5.2% in Zurich trading to 35.16 Swiss francs, with the decline offsetting gains from the earnings beat and capital return announcements.

The results reflect the challenges facing global banks in navigating volatile markets while managing multi-year integration projects. UBS's Credit Suisse integration remains on track for $13 billion in annualized cost savings by 2027, but the US wealth outflows highlight execution risks in key growth markets. Management attributed the outflows to competitive dynamics rather than structural issues, projecting stabilization in coming quarters.

### 5. Novo Nordisk Collapses 20% This Week as Weight-Loss Drug Competition Intensifies
*Feb 6*

> Shares of the Danish pharmaceutical giant have lost more than a fifth of their value this week after issuing guidance calling for 5-13% sales decline in 2026, with pricing pressure on Wegovy and competition from low-cost alternatives crushing investor sentiment.

The selloff began Tuesday after Novo forecast its first annual sales decline in decades, citing significantly lower US pricing on its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy. The new oral Wegovy pill launched at $149 per month—a fraction of the injectable version's price—but even that proved insufficient as Hims & Hers announced a $49 copycat version, prompting Novo to threaten legal action.

The 17% single-day plunge on Wednesday marked one of the worst sessions in Novo's history as investors digested the implications of intensifying competition in the weight-loss market. Patent expiries in ex-US markets will further pressure sales, while the US government's push to cut drug prices adds regulatory headwinds. CEO Mike Doustdar acknowledged the situation "will get worse before it gets better."

Despite the challenges, some analysts see opportunity. The Wegovy pill launch exceeded expectations, with 170,000 patients starting treatment in just four weeks. The weight-loss drug market is projected to exceed $150 billion annually by 2030, suggesting ample room for multiple competitors. However, Novo's premium valuation had priced in continued dominance, and the recalibration of expectations has been painful for shareholders.

### 6. Reddit Jumps 13% on Earnings Beat and $1 Billion Buyback Announcement
*Feb 6*

> The social media platform reported Q4 revenue of $725.6 million—up 70% year-over-year and well above expectations—while announcing a $1 billion share repurchase program and projecting continued strong growth from advertising and AI data licensing.

Reddit delivered earnings of $1.24 per share, crushing analyst estimates of $0.95, with daily active users climbing 19% to 121.4 million. The company's AI data-licensing agreements with major technology companies have emerged as a significant revenue stream, contributing to margins that exceeded Wall Street expectations. Management indicated advertiser demand and engagement trends have remained steady into Q1.

The stock's 13% surge stood out in a technology sector still recovering from the week's volatility. Reddit's smaller market capitalization and less capital-intensive business model differentiated it from the mega-cap tech companies whose massive AI spending plans have concerned investors. The buyback announcement—a first for the company since its 2024 IPO—signaled management confidence in the stock's value.

However, the rally came with caveats. Some analysts raised concerns about regulatory scrutiny of Reddit's AI data deals and the sustainability of licensing revenue as AI companies develop alternative data sources. The stock briefly dipped 8% in early trading before recovering, reflecting the mixed sentiment. Full-year 2026 guidance came in above consensus, supporting the afternoon rally.

### 7. Gold Rallies Above $4,950 as Geopolitical Uncertainty Drives Safe-Haven Demand
*Feb 6*

> Gold surged 3.5% to above $4,950 per ounce Friday, recovering from mid-week volatility as lingering geopolitical tensions and signs of US economic softening reinforced the metal's safe-haven appeal despite equity market gains.

The precious metal has risen 11.4% over the past month and 73.5% year-over-year, benefiting from central bank purchases, inflation concerns, and geopolitical uncertainty. Friday's rally came despite the strong equity performance, suggesting gold is responding to different factors than risk assets. UBS strategists characterized the week's volatility as "normal within a continuing structural uptrend."

Goldman Sachs maintained its $5,400 year-end target, citing "significant upside risk" to current forecasts. Central bank purchases have accelerated as nations diversify reserves away from the US dollar, with China, India, and Turkey among the largest buyers. The dual dynamic of institutional demand and retail investment has supported prices even as real interest rates have risen.

The gold rally contrasts sharply with silver, which crashed 36% on January 31 in its worst single-day decline since 1980. The divergence reflects different demand drivers, with gold's monetary properties providing support while silver's industrial exposure left it vulnerable to economic slowdown concerns. Analysts expect continued volatility in precious metals as markets navigate conflicting signals from inflation, growth, and geopolitical developments.

### 8. Consumer Sentiment Beats Expectations as Inflation Fears Ease
*Feb 6*

> The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 57.3 in February—beating the 55.0 consensus estimate—while year-ahead inflation expectations fell to 3.5% from 4%, the lowest reading since January 2025.

The improvement marked the second consecutive monthly increase in sentiment, suggesting households are feeling marginally better about their financial prospects despite persistent concerns about high prices and labor market uncertainty. The 3.5% inflation expectation, while still elevated above the 2.3-3.0% pre-pandemic range, indicates easing anxiety about future price increases.

However, the absolute level of sentiment remains depressed relative to historical norms. The 57.3 reading is down 11.4% from the same period last year, reflecting ongoing pressures on household finances. Consumer spending has remained resilient despite weak sentiment readings, creating a disconnect between how people feel and how they behave—a pattern that has persisted throughout the post-pandemic period.

The data provided modest support for equity markets Friday, though the sentiment improvement was overshadowed by the broader recovery from Thursday's selloff. Economists noted that the easing inflation expectations could support the Federal Reserve's patient approach to rate policy, reducing pressure for near-term cuts while keeping the option available if conditions deteriorate.

### 9. Oil Prices Volatile as US-Iran Talks Ease Immediate Conflict Fears
*Feb 6*

> Brent crude traded around $68 per barrel Friday after swinging sharply through the week, with prices easing on news that US-Iran talks in Oman produced at least temporary diplomatic engagement rather than breakdown.

The confirmation that negotiations would proceed helped ease near-term concerns over military conflict and supply disruptions involving Iran, which accounts for about 3% of global crude production. However, the talks produced no concrete agreement, leaving the geopolitical risk premium partially in place. Saudi Arabia's decision to cut prices for its main Asian crude grade to the lowest since late 2020 added to the bearish sentiment.

The oil market is navigating conflicting signals: geopolitical tensions that could disrupt supply versus expectations of 2026 surplus that would pressure prices regardless. OPEC+ has maintained production restraints, but non-OPEC supply growth—particularly from the United States, Brazil, and Guyana—is expected to outpace demand growth. The World Bank projected commodity prices could fall to six-year lows amid the surplus.

For now, prices remain elevated relative to fundamental supply-demand balances, with analysts estimating $7-8 per barrel of geopolitical risk premium. A lasting de-escalation with Iran could bring additional barrels to market while removing that premium—a significant downside risk for prices. Friday's trading reflected cautious optimism that the worst-case military scenario has become less likely, without conviction that diplomatic resolution is imminent.

### 10. Caterpillar Hits All-Time High as AI Data Center Boom Drives Equipment Demand
*Feb 6*

> Shares of the industrial giant surged to a record $723.32 as the company reported strong Q4 results and highlighted its growing role in powering AI data centers, with a 2-gigawatt natural gas generator order for the Monarch Compute Campus.

Caterpillar reported Q4 2025 revenue of $19.1 billion and full-year revenue of $67.6 billion, issuing 2026 guidance targeting sales growth near the top of its 5-7% long-term range. The company's power and energy division has become an unexpected beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout, as data centers require massive amounts of electricity that often cannot be met by the existing grid. The Monarch order alone represents one of the largest generator commitments in company history.

The stock has appreciated 88% over the past year, with the AI exposure adding a technology-adjacent growth narrative to the traditional cyclical industrial story. Caterpillar's autonomous mining and construction equipment division reported record backlog, with AI-driven machinery commanding premium pricing. The combination of infrastructure investment, energy transition, and AI compute demand has created a uniquely favorable environment.

Some analysts cautioned about valuation, with the stock trading at 38x forward earnings—well above historical averages for industrial companies. However, bulls argue the AI data center opportunity represents a structural shift that justifies higher multiples. Friday's 6% gain made Caterpillar one of the session's best performers, contributing significantly to the Dow's record-breaking climb above 50,000.
