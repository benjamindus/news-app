## Fusion Energy

### China's EAST Tokamak Breaks Through Plasma Density Barrier - *Jan 1*

> Scientists achieve stable plasma operation beyond the Greenwald density limit, unlocking a critical path toward sustained fusion ignition.

China's Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) has successfully demonstrated stable plasma confinement at densities 1.6 times higher than the theoretical Greenwald limit—a ceiling that has constrained tokamak performance for decades. The breakthrough, published in Science Advances on January 1, 2026, represents one of the most significant advances in fusion physics in recent years and could reshape how future reactors are designed.

For decades, pushing plasma density beyond the Greenwald limit typically triggered violent disruptions that damage reactor walls and terminate fusion reactions. EAST researchers discovered that by carefully controlling plasma-wall interactions during startup—specifically by optimizing fuel gas pressure and applying electron cyclotron resonance heating—they could minimize impurity buildup and energy losses. This allows the plasma to enter what theorists call a "density-free regime," where the usual ceiling no longer applies.

The implications extend far beyond EAST itself. ITER, SPARC, and other next-generation reactors aim to achieve sustained fusion ignition, which requires maintaining extremely high plasma densities. If this approach can be replicated across different reactor designs, it could accelerate timelines for commercial fusion power by allowing reactors to operate closer to optimal conditions without fear of catastrophic instabilities. Researchers at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and other institutions are now working to validate these findings on spherical tokamaks and conventional designs.

### Commonwealth Fusion Systems Completes First SPARC Magnet Installation - *Jan 7*

> CFS achieves critical construction milestone as first toroidal field magnet is placed on assembly jig, keeping 2027 net energy target on track.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems reached a pivotal construction milestone in early January 2026 when the first of 18 massive toroidal field magnets was completed and placed onto the assembly jig inside the building housing SPARC, the company's demonstration tokamak in Devens, Massachusetts. The milestone marks the transition from component manufacturing to full-scale reactor assembly, with company officials describing the process as "a complicated Lego set, but we have a good set of instructions and a good set of people that will put it together."

SPARC's magnets represent a technological leap enabled by high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape made from yttrium barium copper oxide. Unlike conventional superconductors that require cooling to near absolute zero, HTS magnets can generate enormous magnetic fields while operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 Kelvin), dramatically reducing cooling costs and system complexity. Each toroidal field magnet is designed to generate field strengths exceeding 12 Tesla, enabling SPARC's compact size while achieving plasma conditions previously possible only in massive reactors like ITER.

The assembly timeline calls for SPARC to be nearly complete by the end of 2026, with first plasma scheduled for 2027. The reactor is designed to produce at least twice as much fusion energy as it consumes to heat the plasma, achieving a fusion gain (Q) of approximately 11. If successful, SPARC will be the first net-energy fusion device using magnetic confinement and will pave the way for ARC, CFS's first commercial 400-megawatt fusion power plant planned for Richmond, Virginia in the early 2030s. That facility would provide enough electricity to power approximately 300,000 homes.

### National Ignition Facility Achieves Target Gain Record of 4.13 - *Apr 7, 2025*

> Laser fusion experiment produces 8.6 megajoules of energy from 2.08 megajoules input, marking highest energy gain yet achieved.

The National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory set a new world record on April 7, 2025, when a laser fusion shot achieved a target gain of 4.13—producing 8.6 megajoules of fusion energy from 2.08 megajoules of laser energy delivered to the target. This surpasses all previous inertial confinement fusion experiments and demonstrates continued progress toward the conditions needed for a fusion power plant based on laser ignition.

In NIF's indirect drive approach, 192 high-powered laser beams converge on a centimeter-sized cylindrical container called a hohlraum, which holds a peppercorn-sized fuel capsule at its center. The lasers heat the hohlraum's interior walls, generating an intense bath of X-rays that compress and heat the fuel capsule to temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius—conditions found at the cores of stars. When compression is symmetrical and timing is precise, the fuel undergoes fusion, releasing far more energy than was required to trigger the reaction.

While NIF's December 2022 experiment marked the first time a fusion reaction produced more energy than the lasers delivered to the target, subsequent shots have steadily improved both energy yield and target gain. The April 2025 shot's 4.13 gain factor represents a 70% improvement over earlier results and provides crucial data for companies like Focused Energy and other startups pursuing laser-based fusion power plants. However, significant engineering challenges remain: NIF's lasers require approximately 300 megajoules of electrical energy to produce the 2.08 megajoules delivered to the target, meaning overall plant efficiency must improve dramatically before laser fusion becomes commercially viable.

### Helion Energy Breaks Ground on 50-Megawatt Fusion Plant - *Jul 30, 2025*

> Helion begins construction of world's first commercial fusion power plant in Washington, with Microsoft as anchor customer for 2028 delivery.

Helion Energy broke ground in July 2025 on what it calls the world's first commercial fusion power plant, a 50-megawatt facility to be built on property owned by the Public Utility District near Malaga, Washington. The plant is designed to supply electricity to nearby Microsoft data centers by 2028 under the world's first fusion power purchase agreement, announced in 2023. If Helion meets its timeline, this would make it the first private fusion company to deliver commercial electricity to the grid.

Helion's approach differs fundamentally from magnetic tokamaks and laser inertial confinement. The company's seventh-generation prototype, Polaris, uses pulsed magnetic fields to compress plasma into a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC)—a doughnut-shaped plasma ring with no central conductor. Rather than sustaining plasma continuously like a tokamak, Helion's system operates in rapid pulses, compressing deuterium-helium-3 fuel to fusion conditions and then extracting electricity directly through electromagnetic induction, similar to regenerative braking in electric vehicles. This eliminates the need for steam turbines and dramatically simplifies the power conversion process.

As of early 2026, Polaris has successfully formed the largest FRC plasmas Helion has ever created, but the company has not yet announced achieving net electricity production—a milestone originally targeted for 2024 and later revised to late 2025. Skeptics question whether Helion can meet its aggressive 2028 commercial operation timeline given the technical challenges that remain. However, Constellation Energy has signed on as the power marketer for the project, and site work is progressing on schedule, suggesting confidence among key stakeholders that Helion's approach has merit.

### France Completes Final ITER Central Solenoid Module Installation - *Sep 2025*

> World's most powerful magnet arrives at ITER site as international megaproject inches toward first plasma in 2035.

The sixth and final module of ITER's central solenoid—the world's most powerful magnet—arrived in France in September 2025, marking the completion of a critical component manufactured by General Atomics in California. Each module stands 14 feet tall, weighs 250,000 pounds, and is composed of niobium-tin superconducting cable capable of generating magnetic fields of 13 Tesla. When all six modules are stacked and integrated, the complete central solenoid will stand nearly 60 feet tall and generate the pulsed magnetic field needed to initiate and sustain plasma current in ITER's tokamak.

ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, is a multinational collaboration involving the European Union, United States, Russia, China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Located in southern France, ITER is designed to produce 500 megawatts of fusion power from 50 megawatts of heating input—a tenfold energy gain. However, ITER will not generate electricity; instead, it will demonstrate sustained fusion burn and test technologies needed for DEMO, Europe's planned demonstration fusion power plant.

Despite this milestone, ITER continues to face significant delays and cost overruns. The project's first plasma target has slipped from an original estimate of 2016 to a current projection of 2035, while total costs have ballooned to over $25 billion. Critics argue that ITER's scale and complexity make it ill-suited to the fast-paced environment of fusion energy development, where private companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems aim to achieve net energy years before ITER's completion. Nevertheless, ITER's research will provide invaluable data on plasma physics, materials science, and reactor engineering that will benefit all future fusion projects, justifying the international investment in this unprecedented scientific collaboration.

## Human Genetics & Gene Science

### First Infant Receives Personalized CRISPR Therapy for Urea Cycle Disorder - *Feb 2025*

> Customized base-editing treatment for severe genetic disease marks milestone in precision medicine and offers template for treating rare conditions.

In February 2025, an infant diagnosed with severe carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency became the first person in the world to receive a customized CRISPR base-editing therapy created specifically for his unique genetic mutation. The patient, treated by a team at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, had been diagnosed with CPS1 deficiency—a disease with an estimated 50% mortality rate in early infancy. In the seven weeks following the initial infusion, the patient tolerated increased dietary protein and required only half the starting dose of nitrogen-scavenger medication.

CPS1 deficiency is one of several urea cycle disorders that prevent the body from properly eliminating ammonia, a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism. Left untreated, ammonia accumulates to dangerous levels in the bloodstream, causing brain damage, coma, and death. Traditional treatments are limited to strict dietary restrictions and medications that help eliminate ammonia through alternative pathways, but these approaches only manage symptoms rather than addressing the underlying genetic cause.

The therapy uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver a base editor—a modified CRISPR system that can change a single DNA letter without cutting both strands of the double helix. This approach is safer than conventional CRISPR because it minimizes the risk of unintended edits or chromosomal rearrangements. The team designed the therapy in just six months, demonstrating that bespoke gene editing treatments can be developed rapidly for patients with ultra-rare genetic disorders. Researchers now plan to launch a clinical trial in 2026 enrolling patients with any of seven different urea cycle disorders, with FDA approval potentially requiring as few as 5-10 successful treatments.

### FDA Clears New Regulatory Pathway for Bespoke Gene Editing Therapies - *Feb 2026*

> "Plausible Mechanism" framework aims to accelerate approval of personalized treatments for rare diseases with limited patient populations.

In February 2026, the FDA unveiled a new regulatory framework called the "Plausible Mechanism" pathway designed to accelerate the approval of personalized gene editing therapies for rare diseases. Under this approach, therapies that demonstrate a scientifically sound mechanism of action and show preliminary safety and efficacy in a small number of patients could receive conditional approval without requiring large-scale clinical trials—an impossibility for ultra-rare conditions affecting only a handful of individuals.

The pathway was developed in response to the successful treatment of infant KJ Muldoon with a customized CRISPR base editor for CPS1 deficiency. FDA Acting Commissioner Marty Makary and oncologist Vinay Prasad announced the framework after a productive meeting with YouthBio Therapeutics regarding its Alzheimer's gene therapy, stating that the new pathway would "transform how we think about treating one-of-a-kind genetic diseases." The framework requires sponsors to demonstrate that the proposed therapy has a biologically plausible mechanism for correcting the genetic defect, provide preclinical data from animal models or in vitro studies, and show preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy in a limited number of patients.

Critics caution that lowering evidentiary standards could expose patients to unproven treatments, but proponents argue that for patients facing otherwise fatal conditions, the status quo—in which drug development economics make rare disease treatments financially unviable—is itself unacceptable. The pathway builds on the FDA's existing accelerated approval mechanisms but goes further by explicitly acknowledging that for diseases affecting only one or a few dozen people worldwide, traditional randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This regulatory innovation could unlock treatments for thousands of ultra-rare genetic conditions that currently have no therapeutic options.

### CRISPR Base Editor Safety Tool CHANGE-seq-BE Detects Off-Target Edits - *Jan 2026*

> St. Jude researchers develop sensitive method to identify unintended DNA changes from base editors, addressing key safety concern.

Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have developed CHANGE-seq-BE, an unbiased, sensitive, and resource-efficient method to detect off-target edits caused by CRISPR base editors. Published in Nature Biotechnology in January 2026, the technique addresses a critical safety concern as base editors move from laboratory research into clinical trials for treating genetic diseases. While base editors are generally safer than conventional CRISPR-Cas9 because they change single DNA letters without cutting both strands of the double helix, they can still occasionally edit unintended sites in the genome.

Base editors work by fusing a catalytically impaired Cas9 protein to a deaminase enzyme that chemically converts one DNA base to another—either cytosine to uracil (which cells read as thymine) or adenine to inosine (which cells read as guanine). This allows precise correction of point mutations responsible for many genetic diseases. However, the deaminase enzyme can sometimes act on DNA sequences similar to the intended target, or even on sites where the guide RNA partially matches, creating unintended mutations that could potentially cause cancer or other problems.

CHANGE-seq-BE adapts an earlier off-target detection method to specifically capture sites where base editors have made unintended changes. The technique uses circularized DNA and high-throughput sequencing to identify all genomic locations where editing has occurred, providing a comprehensive map of on- and off-target activity. This allows researchers to test different guide RNAs and base editor variants to minimize off-target effects before advancing therapies to human trials. As dozens of base editor clinical trials advance through early-phase testing, tools like CHANGE-seq-BE will be essential for ensuring patient safety and building confidence in this promising class of gene editing therapies.

### AI-Designed CRISPR Editors Successfully Edit Human Genome - *Jan 2026*

> Large language models trained on genomic data create novel gene editors with improved precision and efficiency for therapeutic applications.

Scientists have successfully designed and tested new CRISPR gene editors using artificial intelligence trained on vast genomic datasets, marking a significant milestone in the convergence of machine learning and gene editing technology. Published in Nature in January 2026, the research demonstrates that large language models can identify novel CRISPR systems with therapeutic potential by mining the explosion of genomic sequence data now available from environmental and metagenomic sources.

The research team curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons by systematically mining 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes—roughly equivalent to analyzing the genomes of 8 billion people. They then trained a large language model to understand the sequence patterns, structural motifs, and functional relationships that define effective CRISPR systems. The AI model identified several novel CRISPR-Cas variants not previously characterized in laboratory settings, predicted their guide RNA requirements and target recognition sequences, and suggested modifications to improve their editing efficiency and specificity.

When tested in human cells, the AI-designed editors successfully cut DNA at intended target sites with precision comparable to or exceeding that of widely used Cas9 variants. Some of the novel editors showed improved specificity, making fewer off-target cuts than conventional systems. Others demonstrated the ability to edit genomic regions that are difficult to access with existing tools. The approach promises to dramatically accelerate the discovery of gene editing tools tailored to specific therapeutic applications—for example, editors optimized for particular cell types, or systems compact enough to fit within the payload constraints of adeno-associated virus vectors used for in vivo gene therapy.

### Voyager Therapeutics Advances Friedreich's Ataxia Gene Therapy to 2026 Clinical Trial - *Jan 2026*

> AAV-based therapy aims to restore functional frataxin protein and normalize mitochondrial function in rare neurodegenerative disease.

Voyager Therapeutics announced in January 2026 that it plans to begin clinical testing of its experimental gene therapy for Friedreich's ataxia (FA) later this year. FA is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which encodes frataxin—a protein essential for mitochondrial function. Patients with FA produce insufficient frataxin, leading to progressive damage to the nervous system, heart disease, and loss of coordination. Most patients require a wheelchair by their mid-20s, and life expectancy is significantly reduced.

Voyager's therapy uses an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver a functional copy of the FXN gene to cells throughout the body. The AAV capsid was specifically selected for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, enabling the therapy to reach neurons in the brain and spinal cord where frataxin is critically needed. Once inside cells, the delivered FXN gene produces functional frataxin protein, with the goal of normalizing mitochondrial function and halting or reversing disease progression.

Previous gene therapy attempts for FA have been limited by the challenge of efficiently transducing the central nervous system and achieving sustained frataxin expression at therapeutic levels. Voyager's preclinical studies demonstrated that its vector achieves broad distribution throughout the nervous system and produces frataxin levels sufficient to restore mitochondrial function in animal models. The planned Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety of the therapy and measure changes in frataxin levels, mitochondrial function, and clinical outcomes such as neurological function and cardiac health. With approximately 15,000 people living with FA in the United States and Europe, a successful gene therapy could transform outcomes for a disease that currently has no disease-modifying treatments.

## AI Advancements

### DeepSeek R1 Open-Source Reasoning Model Matches OpenAI o1 Performance - *Jan 20*

> Chinese AI lab releases MIT-licensed reasoning model trained for $6 million, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.

On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model that achieves performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 on mathematics, coding, and complex reasoning tasks—while costing a fraction of the price to develop. DeepSeek claimed R1 was trained for approximately $6 million in compute, compared to OpenAI's reported expenditure exceeding $100 million for o1. The release sent shockwaves through the AI industry and triggered a reassessment of assumptions about the resources required to build frontier models.

Perhaps most remarkably, DeepSeek demonstrated that reasoning capabilities can emerge purely through reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning as a preliminary step. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a variant trained exclusively via RL, developed human-like problem-solving behaviors including breaking complex problems into steps, checking its work, and backtracking when initial approaches failed. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that AI reasoning requires extensive training on human-annotated chain-of-thought examples.

DeepSeek has open-sourced the model weights, training code, and evaluation tools under the MIT License, enabling commercial use without restrictions. By the end of January 2025, DeepSeek had overtaken ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on the Apple App Store in the United States. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang credited DeepSeek with "activating a global shift towards open-source artificial intelligence," noting at CES 2026 that the Chinese model had "caught the world by surprise." The release accelerated efforts by Western AI labs to release competitive open models, with Meta, Mistral AI, and others announcing new open-source reasoning models in response.

### Anthropic Releases Claude 5 with Extended Reasoning and Multi-System Coordination - *Feb 2026*

> Latest Claude model features sustained thinking for complex problems and ability to orchestrate tools across platforms for weeks-long projects.

Anthropic is expected to release Claude 5 in early February 2026, featuring significant improvements in sustained reasoning and multi-system coordination. Unlike previous models that process queries in isolation, Claude 5 is designed to maintain context across extended periods—managing long-term projects, coordinating tool usage across different platforms, and remembering decisions made weeks earlier. The model represents Anthropic's vision of AI moving beyond question-answering toward serving as a genuine collaborative work partner.

The extended reasoning capability allows Claude 5 to "think" for prolonged periods when tackling complex problems, exploring multiple solution paths, identifying potential flaws in its reasoning, and revising its approach iteratively. This sustained deliberation is made more efficient through architectural improvements that reduce the computational cost of extended inference, making it practical for everyday use rather than reserved only for the most difficult problems. Anthropic demonstrated Claude 5 analyzing multi-week research projects, identifying gaps in methodology, suggesting alternative experimental designs, and tracking progress toward research objectives.

Claude 5's multi-system coordination enables it to manage workflows spanning multiple applications and platforms. For example, when asked to plan a conference, Claude 5 can draft an agenda, research venue options, coordinate scheduling across participants' calendars, send invitations, track RSVPs, and adjust plans based on responses—all while maintaining consistency across tools and remembering constraints established at the project's outset. Anthropic positions Claude 5 as a step toward "AI that works the way you do," capable of taking on responsibilities that currently require dedicated project managers or coordinators.

### Neuromorphic Computing Goes Mainstream with Intel Loihi 3 and IBM NorthPole - *Jan 2026*

> Brain-inspired chips deliver 1,000x power efficiency improvement for real-time AI, enabling multi-day autonomous robot operation.

Intel's Loihi 3 and IBM's NorthPole neuromorphic processors reached full commercial production in early 2026, marking the arrival of brain-inspired computing in mainstream AI applications. Unlike conventional processors that execute instructions sequentially, neuromorphic chips mimic the structure and communication patterns of biological neural networks, with artificial neurons that fire asynchronously in response to input signals. This architecture proves dramatically more power-efficient than GPUs for certain AI workloads, particularly those involving real-time sensory processing and decision-making.

The ANYmal D Neuro, a quadruped inspection robot utilizing Intel's Loihi 3 chip, demonstrated 72 hours of continuous operation on a single battery charge—a ninefold improvement over previous GPU-powered versions of the same robot. The neuromorphic processor enables the robot to process camera and sensor data locally in real-time, adjusting its gait dynamically as it navigates complex terrain without requiring constant communication with cloud servers. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have both announced plans to integrate neuromorphic vision systems for autonomous vehicles, where sub-millisecond reaction times are essential for emergency braking and collision avoidance.

Intel's Hala Point system, deployed at Sandia National Laboratories, demonstrates the scalability of neuromorphic computing for large-scale applications. The system comprises 1.15 billion artificial neurons and achieves energy efficiency improvements of three orders of magnitude compared to conventional GPU-based systems for certain workloads. Researchers project that by 2030, neuromorphic supercomputers capable of simulating 86 billion neurons—equivalent to the human brain—will require only 20 megawatts of power, whereas a comparable GPU-based system would consume over 400 megawatts. This efficiency advantage positions neuromorphic computing as a key technology for edge AI, robotics, and applications where power consumption is a primary constraint.

### AI Drug Discovery Platform Delivers Record IND Filings for 2025 - *Jan 2026*

> Machine learning-driven pharmaceutical development sees highest single-year jump in clinical trial applications for AI-originated molecules.

2025 marked a breakthrough year for AI-driven drug discovery, with the highest single-year increase in Investigational New Drug (IND) filings for molecules designed using machine learning platforms. Companies including Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, BenevolentAI, Absci, and Generate Biomedicines collectively filed more than a dozen INDs for AI-originated small molecules and biologics, concentrated primarily in oncology, fibrosis, autoimmune disorders, and rare diseases. The surge signals AI's graduation from experimental research tool to platform-scale engine for pharmaceutical innovation.

The progress builds on advances in protein structure prediction, particularly AlphaFold3 and its open-source competitor OpenFold3, which now accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of protein-ligand complexes, antibody-antigen interactions, and protein-DNA/RNA binding. These capabilities give medicinal chemists unprecedented insight into how candidate drugs will interact with their biological targets, dramatically accelerating lead optimization. Boltz-2, an open-source model from MIT and Recursion, delivers near physics-level accuracy for binding affinity predictions at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than traditional molecular dynamics simulations.

Pharmaceutical companies are now integrating AI throughout the drug development pipeline. Through the AI Structural Biology Network, major pharma companies are collaborating to fine-tune foundation models using proprietary structural data via federated learning—allowing companies to benefit from shared knowledge without exposing confidential intellectual property. Early clinical results are promising: Insilico Medicine's INS018_055, an AI-designed drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, demonstrated encouraging safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in Phase I trials, while Recursion's AI-discovered cancer therapeutic advanced to Phase II. As these AI-originated molecules progress through clinical development, the industry watches closely to see whether AI's promise translates into approved therapies that reach patients.

### Enterprise AI Agents Enter Mainstream with 78% Fortune 500 Deployment - *Jan 2026*

> Autonomous AI systems move from pilot programs to production operations as companies implement governance frameworks for agentic AI.

Enterprise adoption of AI agents accelerated dramatically in late 2025 and early 2026, with 78% of Fortune 500 companies now deploying autonomous AI systems in operational environments—up from 67% a year earlier. The shift from experimentation to production reflects maturing architectures, governance models, and orchestration platforms that enable companies to deploy AI agents without sacrificing control or accountability. Industry analysts project the agentic AI market will reach $89.6 billion in 2026, representing 215% year-over-year growth.

Unlike earlier generations of AI that required explicit instructions for every task, AI agents can autonomously pursue goals, break complex objectives into subtasks, invoke tools and APIs, and adapt their strategies based on feedback. Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, and other enterprise software vendors have embedded agentic capabilities into their platforms, enabling AI agents to coordinate workflows across sales, support, supply chain, and finance. Snowflake and OpenAI announced a $200 million partnership in February 2026 to accelerate deployment of agentic AI for corporate enterprises, integrating OpenAI's reasoning models into Snowflake's Data Cloud.

Leading organizations are implementing "bounded autonomy" architectures that define clear operational limits for AI agents, specify escalation paths to humans for high-stakes decisions, and maintain comprehensive audit trails of agent actions. JPMorgan Chase, for example, deployed an AI agent that autonomously monitors financial transactions for potential fraud, flags suspicious patterns, and generates preliminary investigation reports—but always routes final determinations through human compliance officers. This hybrid approach allows organizations to benefit from AI's speed and consistency while retaining human oversight for decisions with significant consequences. As enterprises gain confidence in these systems, the scope of autonomous agent authority is gradually expanding, with multi-agent systems beginning to coordinate complex cross-functional workflows previously requiring dedicated human project managers.
