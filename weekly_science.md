## Fusion Energy

### General Fusion Sets World Record with 600 Million Neutrons Per Second - *Jan 28, 10:00 AM*

> Canadian company General Fusion achieves highest neutron output ever recorded for Magnetized Target Fusion, validated by IAEA.

General Fusion, a Canadian company specializing in nuclear fusion technology, has set a world record by generating 600 million neutrons per second using Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF). This achievement was recognized and validated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and represents a crucial step toward demonstrating the viability of nuclear fusion as a sustainable and scalable energy source.

During compression, the plasma density rose to about 190 times the starting value and the magnetic field that holds it in place grew more than 13 times stronger, while the plasma stayed stable instead of tearing itself apart and delivered repeatable bursts of fusion neutrons. What sets General Fusion's method apart from traditional fusion techniques is its unique approach involving a liquid metal liner, where high-powered pistons compress the liquid metal mechanically, rapidly compressing plasma within a spherical tokamak.

Dr. Michel Laberge, founder and Chief Scientist of General Fusion, stated: "This is the first-ever compression of a spherical tokamak using a collapsing metal liner. These results strengthen MTF as a viable path to commercial fusion energy." The results come from the long-running Plasma Compression Science experiment series, whose data have been reviewed by independent scientists and published in the journal Nuclear Fusion. The lessons from these experiments feed directly into Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), the larger demonstration device the company has built in Richmond, British Columbia.

### General Fusion Announces $1 Billion SPAC Merger, First Pure-Play Fusion IPO - *Feb 1, 9:00 AM*

> General Fusion becomes first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion through SPAC deal, signaling growing investor confidence.

General Fusion is set to become the first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion, signaling growing investor confidence in the field. The company has agreed to merge with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. III in a roughly $1 billion SPAC deal announced January 21, 2026.

The company's piston-driven, liquid-lithium approach challenges magnet- and laser-based fusion designs while aiming to reduce material degradation. Instead of using powerful magnets or lasers, the model uses mechanical pistons to contain plasma within a liquid lithium shell, offering a potentially more practical path to commercial fusion power.

This IPO represents a watershed moment for the fusion industry, which has collectively raised over $7.1 billion to date. Commonwealth Fusion Systems leads funding at nearly $3 billion following its $863 million Series B2 in August 2025, but General Fusion's public offering opens a new avenue for retail and institutional investors to participate in the fusion energy revolution.

### China's EAST Tokamak Achieves "Density-Free Regime" Breakthrough - *Jan 1, 9:00 AM*

> Chinese scientists break through the long-theorized plasma density limit, removing a major obstacle toward fusion ignition.

Scientists working with China's fully superconducting Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) have successfully reached a long-theorized "density-free regime" in fusion plasma experiments. In this groundbreaking state, the plasma remains stable even when its density rises far beyond traditional limits that have constrained tokamak operations for decades.

The experiment, published in Science Advances, confirmed that plasma can remain stable even at extreme densities if its interaction with the reactor walls is carefully controlled. This finding effectively removes the Greenwald density limit, a major obstacle that has slowed progress toward practical fusion energy generation for years. Using a newly developed high-density operating approach on EAST, the team showed that plasma density can be pushed well beyond long-accepted empirical limits without triggering violent instabilities.

The breakthrough demonstrates that with proper wall conditioning and plasma control techniques, tokamaks can operate at much higher performance levels than previously thought possible, bringing commercial fusion power closer to reality. This research could fundamentally change how future fusion reactors are designed and operated.

### U.S.-Japan Strategic Fusion Partnership Launched - *Jan 28, 2:00 PM*

> U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering establish collaboration to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate commercialization.

The U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering launched a strategic partnership to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate deployment of commercial fusion power. The agreement could serve as a model for joint public-private investment and international collaboration to develop fusion technology and infrastructure.

Collaboration between U.S. and U.K. research teams has already yielded crucial findings. Both machines confirmed that energy confinement scales more favorably to the expected operating regime in fusion pilot plants in spherical tokamaks than in conventional designs—a finding that could determine the shape of future commercial fusion plants.

This international cooperation reflects growing recognition that fusion energy development benefits from shared resources and expertise across borders. With multiple countries racing toward commercial fusion, partnerships like this one help distribute both the costs and the knowledge gained from cutting-edge experiments.

### Commonwealth Fusion Systems Partners with NVIDIA and Siemens for AI-Powered Development - *Jan 6, 8:00 AM*

> CFS announces partnership leveraging AI-powered digital twins to compress years of fusion experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems has announced a major partnership with NVIDIA and Siemens to accelerate the development of commercial fusion energy using artificial intelligence. The collaboration will create AI-powered digital twins of fusion systems to dramatically speed up the development process.

"CFS will be able to compress years of manual experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization using the digital infrastructure developed by NVIDIA and Siemens," said Bob Mumgaard, Co-Founder and CEO of CFS. Leveraging data from Siemens and an AI platform from Nvidia, CFS is creating what it calls a "digital twin" of its demonstration machine to speed progress toward commercial fusion.

CFS aims to hit a key technical milestone in 2027—generating net energy at its SPARC demonstration reactor in Massachusetts—before producing commercial-scale fusion energy in the early 2030s. The company has raised nearly $3 billion to date, making it the best-funded private fusion venture in the world.

## Human Genetics & Gene Science

### First Patient Dosed with CRISPR Epigenetic Silencer for Hepatitis B - *Jan 30, 10:00 AM*

> nChroma Bio begins Phase 1/2 trial of CRMA-1001, a CRISPR-derived therapy that silences hepatitis B virus without cutting the genome.

nChroma Bio has dosed the first patient with CRMA-1001, an innovative CRISPR-Cas–derived epigenetic silencer designed to treat chronic hepatitis B infection. Unlike traditional gene editing, this therapy methylates viral DNA without making cuts to the genome, representing a fundamentally new approach to treating viral diseases.

The open-label Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and antiviral durability of the treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Regulatory approvals have enabled the study to expand to the UK and New Zealand, broadening the international scope of this promising research. CRMA-1001 specifically targets HBV cccDNA and integrated viral DNA, aiming to achieve a functional cure by silencing the virus's ability to replicate.

This represents a new paradigm in treating viral infections, using precision epigenetic tools to silence viral genes while leaving the host genome intact. With approximately 296 million people living with chronic hepatitis B worldwide, a functional cure could transform global public health outcomes for this persistent viral infection.

### CRISPR Breakthrough: Turning Genes On Without Cutting DNA - *Jan 4, 3:00 PM*

> Scientists develop safer gene therapy approach using epigenetic editing to reactivate silenced genes without making permanent cuts to DNA.

Scientists at UNSW Sydney have developed a revolutionary new form of CRISPR technology that can turn genes back on without cutting DNA. Instead of making permanent edits to the genetic code, this approach removes chemical tags (methyl groups) that act like molecular anchors, silencing genes.

The work confirms that these epigenetic tags actively silence genes, settling a long-running scientific debate in the field. Rather than cutting DNA, the new technique uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups, releasing the genetic brakes that keep certain genes switched off. One key target is the fetal globin gene, which helps deliver oxygen before birth.

Reactivating the fetal globin gene after birth could help bypass defects in the adult globin gene that cause Sickle Cell disease. Scientists say this breakthrough opens the door to powerful new therapies with fewer unintended side effects, potentially transforming the gene therapy landscape and making treatments accessible to more patients who currently have limited options.

### Personalized CRISPR Therapy Team Plans Landmark Clinical Trial - *Jan 28, 11:00 AM*

> Researchers behind KJ Muldoon's historic treatment plan new trial type that could treat multiple rare diseases with as few as 5-10 patients.

The team behind the world's first personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy is planning an entirely new type of clinical trial to make this technology more accessible to patients with rare diseases. Researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine created a bespoke in vivo CRISPR therapy for infant KJ Muldoon in just six months.

The researchers plan to launch a clinical trial in 2026 that can enroll patients with any of 7 different urea cycle disorders, caused by any variant in any of 7 genes that can be corrected by the same type of gene editor used in KJ's therapy. Successful treatment of a small number of participants—as few as 5-10—might be sufficient for FDA approval.

This landmark case paves the way for a future with on-demand gene-editing therapies for individuals with rare, until-now untreatable genetic diseases. The approach could fundamentally change how rare disease treatments are developed and approved, making personalized medicine a reality for thousands of patients with ultra-rare conditions.

### CRISPR CAR-T Therapy Shows 70% Complete Response in Cancer Trials - *Jan 28, 2:00 PM*

> CRISPR Therapeutics' allogeneic CAR T therapy zugo-cel achieves remarkable results in B-cell lymphoma and autoimmune disease trials.

CRISPR Therapeutics' allogeneic CAR T therapy, zugo-cel (CTX112), is showing remarkable early promise in clinical trials for both autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), a 100M-cell dose induced rapid B-cell depletion and clinical improvement.

Importantly, the therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) observed. In relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma patients, a higher 600M-cell dose achieved an impressive complete response rate of 70%.

These results position zugo-cel as a potential breakthrough in both oncology and autoimmune disease treatment, with the allogeneic (off-the-shelf) approach potentially making CAR-T therapy accessible to far more patients than current autologous approaches that require manufacturing cells from each individual patient.

### iECURE's Gene Editing Treatment Receives Dual Fast-Track Designations - *Jan 21, 9:00 AM*

> ECUR-506 secures both FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation and UK Innovation Passport for treating neonatal conditions.

iECURE's ECUR-506 gene editing treatment has received significant regulatory recognition, securing both the US FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation and a UK Innovation Passport. These designations will accelerate the development pathway for this promising therapy targeting severe neonatal conditions.

The treatment targets severe neonatal conditions where early intervention is critical. The dual regulatory fast-tracking demonstrates international recognition of the therapy's potential to address unmet medical needs in some of the most vulnerable patient populations.

RMAT designation provides intensive FDA guidance, eligibility for priority review, and potential accelerated approval, while the UK Innovation Passport offers similar benefits in the British regulatory system, positioning ECUR-506 for rapid global development. This dual recognition underscores growing momentum for gene editing therapies treating conditions that were previously considered untreatable.
