### 1. Portugal Elects Socialist António José Seguro as President in Landslide Victory Over Far-Right Rival
*Feb 8*

> Center-left Socialist candidate António José Seguro won Portugal's presidential runoff election with 66.7% of votes compared to 33.3% for hard-right populist André Ventura, marking only the second time in Portuguese history that a direct presidential election went to a second round.

The 63-year-old Socialist candidate will succeed conservative Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as president after a commanding victory that saw him win 303 out of 308 municipalities and all 20 districts. The decisive margin represents a strong rejection of Ventura's far-right Chega party platform, which had gained momentum in recent years amid concerns about immigration and economic policy. Seguro's victory signals Portugal's continued commitment to moderate, center-left governance even as far-right movements have gained ground elsewhere in Europe.

In the first round held on January 18, Seguro secured 31% while Ventura came second with 23.5%, but neither candidate reached the required 50% threshold. The runoff saw Seguro consolidate support from across the political spectrum, including voters who supported other candidates in the first round. Despite losing the overseas vote to Ventura, Seguro's domestic support proved overwhelming, particularly in urban centers and traditional Socialist strongholds.

The election comes at a critical time for Portugal as it navigates economic challenges including inflation pressures and housing affordability crises. Seguro's campaign focused on defending democratic institutions, promoting social cohesion, and maintaining Portugal's commitment to European integration. His presidency will be largely ceremonial but carries significant symbolic weight in a Europe increasingly polarized between establishment and populist forces.

### 2. US Proposes June Deadline to End Ukraine War as Peace Talks Continue Without Breakthrough
*Feb 8*

> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed that the United States is proposing both Ukraine and Russia end the war by the beginning of summer 2026, following a second round of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi that concluded February 5 without a major breakthrough on territorial disputes.

The June deadline represents the Trump administration's effort to accelerate diplomatic progress after two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi failed to bridge fundamental disagreements over territory. Russia continues to demand Ukraine withdraw from all of the Donbas region, including heavily fortified cities that represent some of Ukraine's strongest defenses. Kyiv categorically rejects any unilateral pullback and insists any ceasefire must freeze the conflict along current front lines, with neither side willing to concede on this core issue.

Zelensky stated that "The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer," adding that if the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to reach an agreement. The talks concluded on February 5 with a prisoner exchange agreement for 314 POWs and a commitment to reestablish U.S.-Russia military-to-military dialogue, but the readout described discussions as "constructive" rather than yielding concrete progress on the underlying conflict.

The diplomatic push comes as the war approaches its fourth anniversary this month, with both sides entrenched in positions that appear mutually exclusive. The United States and Russia agreed to restore military communication channels, which observers view as a positive step toward preventing miscalculation, but European allies have expressed concern about being excluded from the trilateral format. France and the United Kingdom have pledged to deploy forces to Ukrainian territory if a ceasefire is reached, offering security guarantees that could form part of a final settlement.

### 3. Israel Security Cabinet Approves Sweeping Measures to Deepen Control Over West Bank
*Feb 8*

> Israel's security cabinet on Sunday approved measures aimed at strengthening Israeli control over the occupied West Bank and weakening the Palestinian Authority, including repealing a Jordanian-era regulation that restricted the sale of West Bank land to private Jewish individuals.

The new rules will make it easier for Israeli settlers to purchase land in the occupied West Bank and give Israeli officials stronger powers to enforce laws on Palestinians in the area. Central to the decision is the repeal of a decades-old regulation from the Jordanian administration period that had limited land sales, a move Palestinian officials describe as facilitating de facto annexation. The measures also expand the authority of Israeli civil administration officials to implement regulations in Area C, which comprises approximately 60% of the West Bank and remains under full Israeli control under the Oslo Accords.

The Palestinian presidency immediately condemned the decision as "dangerous" and an "open Israeli attempt to legalize settlement expansion" and land confiscation. President Mahmoud Abbas's office called on the United States and the United Nations Security Council to intervene immediately, warning that the unilateral measures aim to eliminate any political prospects and obliterate the two-state solution. Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh characterized the steps as a violation of all signed and binding agreements, international law, and a serious escalation that drags the entire region into further tension and instability.

The timing of the announcement, coming on a Sunday when international attention is often reduced, follows a pattern of controversial policy announcements during weekend news cycles. The measures represent the most significant expansion of Israeli administrative control over the West Bank in years and are likely to draw condemnation from the international community, though previous such moves have rarely resulted in meaningful consequences. The decision further complicates any prospects for renewed peace negotiations and deepens the already profound mistrust between Israeli and Palestinian leadership.

### 4. China and South Korea Resume Defense Talks to Restore Joint Maritime Search-and-Rescue Drills
*Feb 5*

> China and South Korea held working-level defense talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss resuming joint maritime search-and-rescue drills that have been suspended for approximately 15 years, marking a significant step in bilateral military cooperation amid regional security tensions.

The talks were led by Lee Kwang-suk, director general of South Korea's Defense Ministry International Policy Bureau, and his Chinese counterpart, Guo Hongtao. The SAREX (Search and Rescue Exercise) drills were last conducted in 2011, with previous iterations held in 2005, 2007, and 2008. Officials agreed to restore defense cooperation, expand its scope, and revive dormant channels for strategic military communication through continued discussions, with the exercises set to take place in the Yellow Sea.

The drills are intended to promote humanitarian maritime cooperation, improve safety at sea, and expand military exchanges aimed at strengthening relations between the two countries. The resumption discussions come as both nations take steps to improve bilateral relations and address pending issues following summit talks between South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and Chinese President Xi Jinping in early January. The meeting represents a practical effort to rebuild trust and operational coordination after more than a decade of suspended joint military activities.

The timing is significant given ongoing tensions in Northeast Asia, including North Korea's continued weapons development, competing territorial claims in regional waters, and the broader U.S.-China strategic competition. While the humanitarian focus of search-and-rescue exercises is less politically sensitive than combat-oriented drills, the resumption still signals both countries' desire to maintain functional military-to-military communication channels. The restoration of these exercises could serve as a foundation for expanded defense dialogue if bilateral relations continue to improve.

### 5. European Union Proposes 20th Sanctions Package Targeting Russia's Shadow Oil Fleet and Energy Revenues
*Feb 6*

> The European Commission presented a draft of the EU's 20th sanctions package against Russia, focusing on energy, financial services, and trade, with the centerpiece being a full ban on maritime services for Russian crude oil aimed at crippling the Kremlin's shadow tanker fleet.

The proposed maritime services ban would prohibit EU companies from providing any type of service—including insurance, shipping, or port access—to vessels carrying Russian crude oil, regardless of whether they comply with the G7 price cap. This represents a significant escalation from current rules, which allow such services for tankers that respect the $60-per-barrel price ceiling imposed in December 2022. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the measure should be implemented "in coordination with like-minded partners after a decision" at the G7 level, though Finland and Sweden have been advocating for the blanket ban for months.

On energy, the package introduces sweeping bans on provision of maintenance and other services for LNG tankers and icebreakers to further dent Russia's gas export projects. The EU is listing 43 more vessels as part of the shadow fleet, bringing the total to 640 designated tankers. The Commission estimates the measure will slash Russia's energy revenues further and make it more difficult to find buyers for its oil. Additionally, the EU is making it harder for Russia to acquire replacement tankers through new restrictions on vessel sales and services.

Beyond energy, the package targets 20 more Russian regional banks and introduces new measures against cryptocurrencies, companies trading them, and platforms enabling crypto transactions to close avenues for sanctions circumvention. New import bans will include metals, chemicals, and critical minerals not yet under sanctions, worth over €570 million, while export restrictions will cover goods and services ranging from rubber to tractors and cybersecurity services, worth more than €360 million. The package must now be discussed and approved by the Council of the EU, requiring unanimous support from all 27 member states before taking effect.

### 6. US Think Tank Urges Renegotiation of Japan Agreement to Maintain Marines on Okinawa Amid China Concerns
*Feb 3*

> The Atlantic Council released a report recommending that Washington renegotiate a decades-old agreement with Japan to retain approximately 5,000 Marines on Okinawa rather than relocating them to Guam, citing the strategic necessity of maintaining forward-deployed forces in the First Island Chain to deter China and North Korea.

The recommendation directly contradicts current U.S.-Japan plans to shift 5,000 Marines and 1,300 dependents from Okinawa to Guam, along with additional forces to other Pacific locations, as part of a long-negotiated force realignment. The Atlantic Council's report also suggests retaining the Corps' airfield in densely populated central Okinawa along with a replacement runway under construction farther north, arguing that the strategic environment has deteriorated significantly since the original agreements were negotiated. The proposed changes would maintain a Marine presence above 9,000 on Okinawa, reversing planned reductions of more than 50%.

The report's authors argue that Okinawa's geographic position within the First Island Chain makes it indispensable for rapid response to potential crises in the Taiwan Strait or Korean Peninsula. With China's military modernization accelerating and North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities expanding, the think tank contends that reducing the Marine presence would create an operational gap at precisely the moment when forward-deployed forces are most needed. The recommendation comes as the U.S. conducts major exercises in the region, including Iron Fist 26, which will run from February 11-26 and February 27-March 9 with approximately 1,550 U.S. and Japanese troops.

The proposal faces significant political obstacles, as the current realignment plan was negotiated over many years to address Okinawan concerns about the heavy U.S. military footprint on the island. Okinawa Prefecture hosts 26,000 to 30,000 U.S. personnel, representing approximately half of all American forces in Japan despite comprising less than 1% of Japan's total land area. Local opposition to the U.S. presence has been persistent, with issues including noise pollution, crime, and environmental damage fueling calls for base reductions. Any attempt to reverse or modify the agreed realignment would require delicate diplomacy with both Tokyo and local Okinawan authorities.

### 7. Measles Outbreak in Washington DC Expands with Multiple Cases Linked to March for Life Event
*Feb 8*

> DC Health officials confirmed multiple cases of measles in the District and warned that attendees of the January March for Life rally may have been exposed, as infected individuals visited major transit hubs including Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Union Station, an Amtrak Northeast Regional train, and the Metro subway system while contagious.

The confirmed cases visited the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and Catholic University while infectious, prompting health officials to issue public exposure notices for anyone who visited these locations during specified time periods. Children's National Hospital also issued a notice concerning potential exposure in its Emergency Department, with a Virginia resident who was confirmed to have measles visiting the facility while contagious on February 2. Health officials are contacting individuals who may have been exposed and are advising anyone possibly exposed who is not fully vaccinated or has a compromised immune system to contact the health department or their healthcare provider immediately.

The outbreak in the nation's capital is part of a broader measles crisis sweeping the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting 733 confirmed measles cases in 20 states so far in 2026 as of last Thursday—representing the biggest measles outbreak the country has faced in decades. According to the CDC, 95% of the cases involved people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, underscoring the critical role of immunization in preventing disease spread.

The high-profile exposure locations raise particular concern given the volume of travelers passing through Union Station and Reagan National Airport, with the potential for the virus to spread to other cities via infected but asymptomatic travelers. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, with each infected person typically infecting 12 to 18 unprotected individuals. The virus can remain airborne and infectious for up to two hours after an infected person leaves a space, making exposure risk significant even for those who were not in direct contact with infected individuals. Public health officials are racing to identify and notify potentially exposed individuals before they unknowingly spread the disease further.

### 8. Somalia Cancels Security Agreements with UAE Amid Federal-Regional Tensions and Al-Shabab Threat
*Jan 2026*

> Somalia's Federal Government announced in January 2026 the cancellation of all bilateral security and defense agreements with the United Arab Emirates, citing national sovereignty concerns, as political fragmentation between Mogadishu and federal member states undermines the fight against al-Shabab.

The decision to sever security ties with the UAE comes amid deepening mistrust between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and federal member states, particularly Puntland and Jubaland, over President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's efforts to amend the country's provisional constitution and centralize executive power. Critics view these moves as a unilateral push to extend Mohamud's time in office beyond his May 2026 mandate while redrawing the federal map to consolidate presidential authority. The UAE had maintained security and counterterrorism cooperation with various Somali regions, making the cancellation significant for operational coordination.

The political infighting has created opportunities for al-Shabab, the proscribed terrorist group and Al-Qaeda affiliate that continues to carry out attacks and control rural areas throughout Somalia. Jihadi group al-Shabab has capitalized on political fragmentation by intensifying attacks, including an assault on a high-security prison in Mogadishu in October. Large portions of the country remain either under the operational control of al-Shabab or dependent on fragile local administrations backed by international peacekeepers from the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM).

Somalia is expected to hold elections in 2026, though disputes over changing its indirect electoral system have threatened to delay the vote and risk a legitimacy crisis. The security environment remains precarious, with Ethiopia agreeing to deploy 2,500 troops to AUSSOM in early 2025 after diplomatic relations with Somalia were restored. However, concerns persist that Ethiopia may attempt to establish a port in Somaliland or seize Assab in Eritrea, ratcheting up regional tensions. The combination of internal political discord, persistent terrorist threats, and complex regional dynamics leaves Somalia at a critical juncture as it approaches both elections and the expiration of Mohamud's presidential mandate.

### 9. Latin America Economic Growth Projected to Slow to 2.2% in 2026 Amid Regional Elections and Trade Tensions
*Feb 2026*

> Economic growth across Latin America and the Caribbean is projected to decelerate to 2.2% in 2026, down from an expected 2.4% expansion in 2025, as the region faces headwinds from U.S. trade policy uncertainty, commodity price volatility, and a challenging electoral calendar featuring presidential votes in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Costa Rica.

The region's top seven economies—Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador—are projected to record GDP growth of just 1.9% in 2026, down from an estimated 2.1% the previous year. Mexico and Brazil, the region's two largest economies, are expected to grow at 1.3% and 1.7% respectively, with Mexico accelerating from 2025's near-zero growth while Brazil consolidates below-trend growth due to a consumption slowdown. Argentina, after a strong GDP rebound expected in 2025 under President Javier Milei's reforms, is forecasted to decelerate toward 3.1% growth in 2026. Peru is forecasted to be the fastest-growing major economy as commodities such as gold and copper hit record highs.

The political calendar adds uncertainty to the economic outlook, with elections testing the rightward political shift seen across much of the Americas in 2025. Peru will hold elections in April and May, Colombian voters go to the polls for the first time at the end of June, and Brazil votes at the beginning of October. Argentina handed President Milei a legislative boost in midterm elections, potentially enabling further economic reforms. The electoral uncertainty complicates investment decisions and policy planning across the region.

U.S. President Donald Trump's approach to the region presents additional challenges, with tariff threats, harsh immigration restrictions, and potential modifications to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) creating volatility for trade-dependent economies. This summer, the three countries face a deadline for whether to scrap, keep, or tweak the USMCA trade deal that took effect in 2020. Mexico's accelerating growth from 2025's near-stagnation depends significantly on maintaining stable trade relations with the United States, while the 2026 FIFA World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada could provide economic benefits if immigration and border issues don't create complications.

### 10. Ethiopia and Somalia Regional Tensions Rise Amid June Elections and Ongoing Insecurity
*Feb 2026*

> Ethiopia is set to hold a general election in June 2026, the first since 2021 when conflict and insecurity prevented voting in many areas, as Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Prosperity Party is expected to win comfortably amid opposition boycotts and a worsening security crisis in Tigray, Amhara, and Oromia regions.

The elections are set to consolidate one-party rule under the Prosperity Party despite the 2022 Pretoria Agreement that ended the Tigray conflict. Key opposition groups are expected to boycott the polls, and voting is unlikely to take place in many contested areas including Tigray, where insecurity persists alongside ongoing tensions with Eritrea over maritime access and sovereignty concerns. The security environment has deteriorated across multiple regions, with ethnic violence and insurgent activity complicating the government's ability to conduct credible elections across the country's diverse regions.

Regional tensions with Somalia have intensified over Ethiopian maritime ambitions, with concerns that Ethiopia may establish a port in Berbera, Somaliland, or attempt to seize Assab in Eritrea. These fears have ratcheted up anxiety in the Horn of Africa, where competing territorial claims and resource access drive interstate tensions. Ethiopia and Somalia restored diplomatic relations and greater cooperation on security in recent months, including Ethiopia's agreement to deploy 2,500 troops to the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) in early 2025, but underlying tensions over sovereignty and maritime access remain unresolved.

Human Rights Watch documented that Kenya's security forces brutally repressed protests using lethal force and committed other serious abuses against protesters, while Ethiopia's security situation in the Horn of Africa continues to be characterized by war crimes and election repression. The June elections in Ethiopia will serve as a critical test of the country's democratic trajectory and regional stability, with implications for neighboring countries including Somalia, Kenya, Eritrea, and Sudan that are grappling with their own security and governance challenges.

### 1. S&P 500 Rebounds $1 Trillion in Week's Strongest Rally Since May Despite Lingering Tech Concerns
*Feb 9*

> The S&P 500 posted its best single-day gain since May on Friday, erasing most of the previous week's AI-driven selloff and recouping approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization, but stock strategists signaled limited conviction in the market's ability to build sustainably on the recovery amid murky economic outlook and AI spending concerns.

Friday's sharp recovery saw the S&P 500 surge 1.97% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the historic 50,000 milestone for the first time, jumping 2.47%. The rally was broad-based, with chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom gaining 7.8% and 7.2% respectively as investors reconsidered the severity of the prior week's rout that was triggered by concerns about massive AI capital expenditure plans and uncertain returns. An ETF tracking software firms added 3.5%, and a gauge of chipmakers soared 5.7% as momentum buyers returned to beaten-down technology names.

However, the relief rally has done little to resolve the fundamental questions plaguing investors about the sustainability of AI infrastructure spending and its eventual return on investment. Investors remain wrestling with persistent concerns about how artificial intelligence will reshape various industries, particularly the software sector that was at the center of the week's turmoil. The S&P 500's futures were indicating a cautiously optimistic start to the new week, advancing approximately 0.1% to 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2% to 0.6% higher.

Despite Friday's surge, market internals revealed continued stress beneath the surface, with the rotation from growth into value stocks accelerating and the "Magnificent Seven" mega-cap technology stocks diverging sharply in performance. The rebound occurred without clear catalysts beyond short-covering and bargain hunting, leaving analysts questioning whether the bounce represents a durable turning point or merely a pause in a broader de-risking process. With key economic data including the delayed January jobs report scheduled for February 11 and Fed speakers lined up throughout the week, investors face significant uncertainty about the economy's true trajectory.

### 2. Apollo Global Management Reports Record Q4 Earnings with $300 Billion in Originations and $225 Billion in Inflows
*Feb 9*

> Apollo Global Management released fourth-quarter 2025 earnings before Monday's market open, reporting record origination activity exceeding $300 billion and inflows of more than $225 billion for the full year, driving record fee and spread-related earnings as CEO Marc Rowan called the results exceptional.

The alternative asset manager's fourth quarter capped what Rowan characterized as "a year of exceptional execution," with the company's origination machine operating at unprecedented scale. Apollo reported earnings per share that met or beat analyst estimates of $1.99, driven by strong performance across its credit, private equity, and real assets platforms. The record origination activity of $300 billion represents the deployment of capital into loans, credit instruments, and equity investments across Apollo's various strategies, while the $225 billion in inflows demonstrates continued strong demand from institutional and retail investors for alternative asset exposure.

Fee and spread-related earnings reached record levels as Apollo's asset base expanded and the firm captured higher margins on both management fees and the spread between borrowing costs and returns on deployed capital. The company's insurance platforms, including Athene, contributed significantly to earnings as rising assets under management generated growing fee streams. Apollo has positioned itself at the intersection of insurance capital and alternative asset management, using permanent capital from insurance subsidiaries to fund long-duration private credit and infrastructure investments.

The earnings report came as investors paid close attention to speeches from Federal Reserve officials, with Fed Governor Christopher Waller scheduled to speak at 1:30 PM ET and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 3:15 PM ET on Monday. The strong results from Apollo underscore the continued institutional appetite for alternative investments despite market volatility, though the firm's rich valuation leaves little room for disappointment. With assets under management continuing to grow and origination pipelines robust, Apollo is positioning itself for another strong year in 2026, though rising competition in private credit and potential economic headwinds pose risks to sustained growth.

### 3. Reddit Shares Surge 13% After Q4 Earnings Beat and $1 Billion Share Buyback Announcement
*Feb 5*

> Reddit reported fourth-quarter revenue of $726 million versus expectations of $665 million and earnings per share of $1.24 versus 94 cents expected, sending shares up 13% after the social media company announced a $1 billion share repurchase program and issued strong first-quarter guidance.

The company's fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% year-over-year, while net income reached $252 million, up nearly 255% from the same period last year. Reddit's advertising business showed particular strength as the platform's user engagement metrics continued to improve and advertisers increasingly recognized Reddit's value for reaching high-intent audiences. The earnings beat marked another quarter of the company exceeding Wall Street's expectations since its March 2024 initial public offering, demonstrating the sustainability of its advertising-driven business model.

Management provided upbeat guidance for the first quarter of 2026, projecting sales in the range of $595 million to $605 million—significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations of $577 million. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter are projected between $210 million and $220 million, ahead of consensus estimates of $203 million. CFO Drew Vollero stated that Reddit can now afford to invest in growth, pursue acquisitions, and buy back shares while keeping over $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, underscoring the company's strengthened financial position.

The $1 billion share buyback authorization signals management's confidence in Reddit's long-term prospects and provides support for the stock price. The announcement comes as Reddit continues to enhance its platform with AI-powered features for content discovery and moderation, expand its advertising offerings, and explore new revenue streams beyond traditional display advertising. However, concerns remain about the company's dependence on AI data licensing revenue and potential regulatory scrutiny of how social media platforms use user-generated content for training large language models. The strong results and guidance have validated the company's strategy, though sustaining 70% year-over-year growth will become increasingly challenging as the revenue base expands.

### 4. Federal Reserve Officials Waller and Bostic to Speak Monday with Divergent Views on Rate Policy
*Feb 9*

> Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are scheduled to speak Monday in what analysts expect will provide insights into the central bank's monetary policy thinking, with the two officials having expressed notably different views on the appropriate pace of rate adjustments.

Governor Waller is scheduled to speak at 1:30 PM ET, with his comments expected to offer insights into the Fed's current monetary policy stance and economic assessment. Waller has recently advocated for rate cuts, having dissented at the most recent FOMC meeting in January after concluding that cutting the policy rate by 25 basis points was appropriate. In his view, monetary policy remains restrictive and is continuing to constrain economic activity, suggesting the Fed has room to ease without reigniting inflation pressures.

In contrast, Atlanta Fed President Bostic is scheduled to speak at 3:15 PM ET and has favored a more restrictive approach. Bostic supported the FOMC's January decision to hold rates steady at the 3.50%-3.75% range, arguing that the central bank needs to maintain a somewhat restrictive stance because inflation remains too high relative to the Fed's 2% target. Bostic's recent public remarks have emphasized the need for patience in assessing whether inflation is sustainably returning to target before cutting rates further.

The divergence between Waller's dovish stance and Bostic's hawkish positioning reflects broader divisions within the Federal Reserve about the appropriate path for monetary policy. Markets currently price in roughly two quarter-point cuts later in 2026, with the first expected in June and a potential second in September. However, Chairman Jerome Powell has reiterated that each decision will depend on incoming data, particularly inflation readings and labor market indicators. The delayed January jobs report, scheduled for release on February 11, will be closely scrutinized for signs of labor market weakening that could justify earlier rate cuts or continued strength that would support Bostic's more cautious approach.

### 5. Palantir Projects 61% Revenue Growth for 2026 Far Above Forecasts as AI Demand Accelerates
*Feb 3*

> Palantir Technologies reported fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share of 25 cents versus 23 cents expected and revenue of $1.41 billion versus $1.33 billion expected, sending shares higher as management guided fiscal 2026 revenue to $7.18-$7.20 billion—implying 61% growth that far exceeded Wall Street's $6.27 billion estimate.

The company's revenue grew 70% from $827.5 million in the year-ago period, with particularly strong performance in commercial markets where U.S. commercial revenue surged 137% to $507 million. Government revenue grew 66% year-over-year, driven by new contracts including a $448 million U.S. Navy deal to launch ShipOS for AI-powered shipbuilding modernization. Total contract value reached $4.26 billion, up 138% from the prior year, demonstrating unprecedented demand for Palantir's AI platforms across both government and commercial sectors.

The 2026 revenue forecast represents the 10th straight quarter of accelerating total revenue growth for Palantir, driven by upside in both commercial and government segments. CEO Alex Karp called the results "the best results that I'm aware of in tech in the last decade," highlighting how the company's positioning at the intersection of artificial intelligence and national security has created a unique growth trajectory. The Pentagon's 2026 budget request included a record $13.4 billion dedicated line item for AI—the first such allocation in DoD history—positioning Palantir as a primary beneficiary of the government AI spending wave.

However, the stock's valuation remains hotly debated, with Palantir trading at approximately 174 times forward earnings and a forward price-to-sales ratio of 67.5. Multiple analysts raised price targets following the earnings beat and guidance raise, with William Blair upgrading shares to Buy with a $200 price target. Bulls argue that Palantir's unique capabilities in handling sensitive government data and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) for commercial enterprises justify premium multiples, while bears contend that even the exceptional growth trajectory is already priced into shares, leaving little margin for error. The guidance for 61% revenue growth in 2026 would make Palantir the fastest company in software history to approach $10 billion in annual revenue at its current margins.

### 6. Advanced Micro Devices Reports Strong Q4 Earnings But Stock Slides on Nvidia Comparison
*Feb 2026*

> Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share on revenue of $10.27 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.32 per share and $9.67 billion in revenue, but shares declined as investors compared AMD's data center growth to Nvidia's dominant AI accelerator performance.

AMD's revenue beat was driven by strength across multiple segments, with data center revenue showing solid growth as the company's MI300 series AI accelerators gained traction with cloud service providers and enterprise customers. The Instinct MI300X GPU has emerged as the primary alternative to Nvidia's dominant H100 and H200 chips, with AMD capturing market share among customers seeking to diversify their AI hardware suppliers. However, AMD's data center growth of 34% year-over-year failed to match Nvidia's trajectory, disappointing investors who had hoped AMD would close the gap more rapidly.

The stock's 17% decline in early February reflected the market's harsh assessment that AMD remains a distant second in the AI accelerator market despite improving product competitiveness. While the MI300 series has won significant design wins at Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, and Meta's infrastructure, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem and first-mover advantage in AI training have proven difficult to overcome. AMD's CPU business also faced headwinds from Intel's improving competitive position in certain server segments, though AMD maintained overall market share leadership in data center processors.

Despite the stock's pullback, AMD's fundamental business remains healthy with strong execution across its product portfolio. The company's acquisition of ZT Systems for $4.9 billion closed in early 2026, providing AMD with enhanced systems design capabilities that should help it compete more effectively for large-scale AI infrastructure deployments. Management reiterated confidence in capturing a "mid-teens" percentage of the AI accelerator market by the end of 2026, which would represent tens of billions in annual revenue. However, investors are increasingly skeptical that AMD can achieve meaningful share gains against Nvidia's entrenched position, leaving the stock vulnerable to continued underperformance despite solid operational execution.

### 7. Treasury Yields Fall to Three-Week Lows as Soft Labor Data Supports Rate Cut Expectations
*Feb 9*

> The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell below the 4.2% mark to the lowest level in three weeks as soft labor market data supported the outlook for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026, with job openings falling to a five-year low in December and January job cuts reaching the highest total for the month since 2009.

The 10-year Treasury yield traded at approximately 4.22%, down from recent highs above 4.40% as investors reassessed the trajectory of monetary policy. The 30-year Treasury yield rose modestly to 4.87%, briefly touching 4.88% earlier—the highest level since September—before retreating. The curve steepening reflects expectations that the Fed will cut short-term rates while long-term yields remain elevated due to persistent fiscal deficits and inflation concerns that continue to exceed the Fed's 2% target.

Labor market weakness has emerged as a key factor shifting Fed expectations, with JOLTS data showing job openings plummeting and layoff announcements surging. January layoffs totaled 108,435—the highest January figure since the depths of the 2009 financial crisis—driven by large-scale reductions at UPS, Amazon, healthcare companies, and technology firms. The softening labor market has increased market pricing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, with investors now expecting two quarter-point reductions in 2026, likely beginning in June.

However, the Fed remains cautious about declaring victory over inflation, with recent data showing consumer prices expanding at the fastest pace in two years. At its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee kept the federal funds target rate at 3.50%-3.75%, with Chairman Jerome Powell emphasizing that policy decisions will remain data-dependent. The delayed January jobs report, rescheduled from February 7 to February 11 due to the government shutdown, will provide critical information about labor market momentum. If the report shows significant weakening, it could accelerate the timeline for Fed rate cuts, though officials have signaled they prefer to wait for clear evidence that inflation is sustainably returning to target before easing policy further.

### 8. Oil Prices Hold Near $63 as Iran Tensions Create Risk Premium Amid Fundamental Oversupply
*Feb 9*

> Crude oil prices stabilized near $63 per barrel on Monday as geopolitical risk premium from U.S.-Iran tensions offset concerns about fundamental oversupply, with analysts warning that prices could fall to EIA's forecast of $56 per barrel if diplomatic progress continues to drain war premium from markets.

Oil experienced extreme volatility in the preceding week, with Brent crude breaching $72 per barrel on fears of U.S. military action against Iran before plunging back toward $60 after diplomatic talks in Oman produced what Tehran called "a good start." The dramatic reversal illustrated how geopolitical speculation has become the dominant short-term driver of energy markets, overwhelming fundamental factors pointing to oversupply. The current price incorporates an estimated $3-$5 per barrel risk premium related to potential supply disruptions in the Persian Gulf.

OPEC+ maintained voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through the first quarter, with eight key producers agreeing on February 1 to pause planned output increases. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman cited seasonal factors and geopolitical uncertainty for the decision to keep barrels off the market. The group's next meeting is scheduled for March, when members will reassess market conditions including the trajectory of U.S.-Iran tensions, Chinese demand recovery, and the impact of potential tariff escalation on global economic growth.

Despite OPEC+ restraint, fundamental supply-demand dynamics point to growing oversupply in 2026. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts West Texas Intermediate crude will average $52 per barrel in 2026, down from $65 in 2025, with Brent expected to average $55 per barrel in the first quarter absent major supply disruptions. Several oil companies have completed or are about to complete major expansion projects, U.S. Permian Basin producers continue increasing output, and OPEC is positioned to gradually increase supplies—putting the world on pace for a supply glut. The challenge for oil markets is reconciling geopolitical risk that could send prices sharply higher with fundamental oversupply that should push prices significantly lower.

### 9. Housing Market Forecast: Mortgage Rates Expected to Remain Above 6% Through 2026 as Home Price Growth Slows
*Feb 2026*

> Mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% throughout 2026 as persistently higher-than-desired inflation continues to offset a slowly weakening labor market, with the current average 30-year fixed rate at approximately 6.2% and forecasters projecting rates will hover near 6.3% for the year.

Major forecasters have aligned on a narrow range for 2026 mortgage rate expectations, with Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale and Redfin both projecting 30-year fixed rates will average 6.3%, while Fannie Mae predicts rates will average 6.2% in the first quarter before potentially declining modestly later in the year. The stubborn elevation of mortgage rates despite Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 reflects persistent inflation concerns and investors' demands for higher risk premiums on long-term fixed-rate debt. J.P. Morgan expects rates to remain elevated at 6+% throughout the year.

Home price growth is projected to slow significantly in 2026 after years of rapid appreciation, with multiple forecasters expecting near-zero or minimal gains. J.P. Morgan projects U.S. home prices will "stall at 0% nationally in 2026," meaning prices flatten on average rather than fall outright, though regional variation remains significant. Redfin expects the median U.S. home-sale price to rise just 1% year-over-year, while Zillow forecasts home values to grow 1.2% in 2026 after national values were roughly flat in 2025. The price deceleration reflects improving inventory levels as pandemic-era migration slows and affordability constraints limit buyer demand.

Construction activity is showing mixed signals, with the National Association of Home Builders projecting 1.05 million new homes built in 2026, up 4% from 2025. However, 2026 is shaping up to be the slowest year for single-family home construction starts since 2019 following a notably weak 2025. Home prices are rising faster in the Northeast and Midwest where there's less newly built housing, while in the South and West they're softening as insurance costs climb and supply increases. The housing market appears to be entering what analysts call "The Great Housing Reset"—a rebalancing after years of pandemic-driven distortions, with growing supply potentially pushing prices down in some markets while affordability remains challenged by elevated mortgage rates.

### 10. Pharmaceutical Industry Sees Major GLP-1 Weight Loss Drug Price Cuts Through TrumpRx Platform
*Feb 2026*

> Major pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk struck deals with the Trump administration to dramatically reduce prices of weight loss drugs through a new government platform called TrumpRx, with monthly costs dropping from over $1,000 to as low as $245 for Medicare patients and $350 for general purchases.

Under the agreements announced in early 2026, Novo Nordisk's semaglutide agents Ozempic and Wegovy will see monthly prices reduced from approximately $1,000 and $1,350 respectively to $350 when purchased through TrumpRx. Medicare and state Medicaid programs will pay just $245 per month for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro (tirzepatide for diabetes and obesity). Critically, Medicare will cover obesity treatments for the first time, representing a major expansion of access to weight loss medications for millions of seniors.

The pharmaceutical companies also committed to making oral GLP-1 pills available at significantly reduced prices, with Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide pill priced at $150 monthly for lower doses and up to $300 for higher doses, while Eli Lilly's oral weight loss pill—expected to gain FDA approval later in 2026—will cost $400 monthly. These prices apply when patients purchase without using health insurance, providing an affordable option for individuals whose plans don't cover weight loss drugs. The oral formulations represent a significant advancement over current injectable medications, potentially improving adherence and expanding the addressable patient population.

Eli Lilly reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results and forecast 2026 profit above Wall Street estimates, betting on surging demand for obesity drugs as the company prepares to launch its oral weight-loss pill later this year. However, Lilly management warned that pricing will be a drag on growth in the low- to mid-teens in 2026, as the company expects to deliver industry-leading volume growth partially offset by lower realized prices from the TrumpRx agreements and increasing competitive pressure. The deals represent a landmark moment for pharmaceutical pricing policy, demonstrating the Trump administration's ability to negotiate significant price reductions while maintaining pharmaceutical company profitability through expanded volume access.
