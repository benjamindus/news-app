### 1. Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol Sentenced to Life in Prison for Leading December 2024 Insurrection
*Feb 19*

> South Korean court sentenced former President Yoon Suk Yeol to life imprisonment on February 19 for leading an insurrection through his brief imposition of martial law on December 3, 2024, rejecting prosecutors' demand for the death penalty while former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun received 30 years and former prime minister Han Duck-soo received 23 years in the largest political prosecution in South Korea's democratic era.

A Seoul court found former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, 65, guilty of leading an insurrection during his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3, 2024, when he declared in a late-night televised speech that there were "anti-state forces" within opposition parties sympathetic to North Korea. The judge ruled Yoon guilty of rebellion for mobilizing military and police forces in an illegal attempt to seize the liberal-led National Assembly, arrest politicians, and establish unchecked power for a "considerable" time, plunging the country into political chaos and threatening to unravel decades of democracy.

Special prosecutors had demanded the death penalty, arguing Yoon's actions posed a threat to the country's democracy and deserved the most serious punishment available, but the court opted for life imprisonment — the most severe sentence short of execution. The poorly-planned power grab did not result in casualties, and most analysts had expected a life sentence rather than capital punishment given the brief duration of the martial law attempt, which was overturned by the National Assembly within hours. Former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who played a major role in the insurrection, was sentenced to 30 years in prison, while former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo received a 23-year sentence, and former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min received seven years.

The trial and sentencing represent the largest political prosecution in South Korea's democratic era and underscore the strength of the country's democratic institutions in responding to attempts to subvert constitutional order. The martial law episode lasted only a few hours on December 3, 2024, as lawmakers climbed over barricades to convene an emergency session that unanimously voted to overturn Yoon's decree, forcing him to rescind the order. Yoon was impeached, arrested, and prosecuted over the following months in a process that transfixed South Korea and drew international attention to the resilience of its democratic system. The sentencing closes a tumultuous chapter in South Korean politics while raising questions about the longer-term implications for conservative politics in the country.

### 2. Trump Demands UK Prime Minister Starmer "Not Give Away" Diego Garcia in Fresh Attack on Chagos Islands Deal
*Feb 19*

> President Trump escalated his criticism of the UK's Chagos Islands agreement with Mauritius on February 19, posting "DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!" and warning Prime Minister Keir Starmer that leases are "no good when it comes to Countries," as the US and Mauritius prepare for talks on the deal from February 23-25 despite Trump's statement that the Diego Garcia military base may be needed for potential strikes on Iran.

U.S. President Donald Trump sharply criticized the UK's plan to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius on February 19, telling British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he should "not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia" and that leases are "no good when it comes to Countries." Trump posted on social media that Starmer is "making a big mistake" in the agreement to transfer sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius while leasing the island of Diego Garcia — home to a UK-US military base — back from Mauritius for 99 years. The criticism represents a dramatic reversal from Trump's early February statement that he understood "the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made" was "according to many, the best he could make."

Trump warned that the military base on Diego Garcia may be needed to respond to a possible attack from Iran, posting that "it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack" from Tehran. The statement came as senior US national security officials informed Trump that the military is ready for potential strikes on Iran as early as Saturday, February 21, creating a context in which control of Diego Garcia — one of the most strategically located US military facilities in the Indian Ocean — has taken on immediate operational significance. The UK government negotiated the Chagos deal with Mauritius over several years, framing it as a resolution to a longstanding sovereignty dispute while preserving the Diego Garcia base's military function through the long-term lease arrangement.

The U.S. and Mauritius are scheduled to hold talks on the Chagos deal from February 23-25, with the U.S. Department of State noting that the discussions underscore the continued importance of the Chagos archipelago and the joint U.S.-UK base. The agreement has drawn criticism from multiple quarters: some UK lawmakers argue Britain is giving away strategic territory, while human rights advocates note that the indigenous Chagossian population removed from the islands in the 1960s and 1970s has not been granted the right of return under the Mauritius agreement. Trump's intervention adds significant political pressure on Starmer's government and raises the possibility that Washington could attempt to renegotiate or block portions of the arrangement.

### 3. JetBlue Flight 543 Makes Emergency Landing at Newark After Engine Failure and Cockpit Smoke
*Feb 19*

> JetBlue Flight 543 from Newark to West Palm Beach returned to Newark Liberty International Airport approximately 20 minutes after takeoff on February 19 following an engine failure and smoke in the cockpit, with 122 passengers evacuating via emergency slides and one passenger hospitalized for chest pains as the FAA temporarily paused arrivals to the airport to investigate the incident.

JetBlue Flight 543, an Airbus A320 bound for West Palm Beach, took off from Newark Liberty International Airport at 5:30 p.m. EST on February 19 — 45 minutes later than its scheduled departure — and returned approximately 20 minutes later following a reported engine issue and smoke in the cabin. The plane departed Newark at 5:30 p.m. EST and returned around 5:55 p.m. local time, with the crew reporting smoke in the cockpit as the aircraft exited the runway after landing safely. The FAA temporarily paused some arrivals to the airport as authorities investigated the incident, creating delays across the Newark flight schedule during the evening rush period.

There were 122 passengers on board, and the crew initiated an emergency evacuation via slides after the plane came to a stop on the taxiway. One passenger was taken to a local hospital after reporting chest pains, while the remaining passengers and crew deplaned without serious injuries reported at the time. The plane landed safely with no injuries initially reported, and JetBlue immediately launched an internal investigation in coordination with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board, which dispatches teams to investigate aircraft incidents involving emergency evacuations. Newark Liberty International Airport was temporarily closed to some arrivals as emergency crews responded to the scene, with the ground stop lifted approximately 90 minutes after the incident.

Engine failures on commercial aircraft are rare but not unprecedented, and the Airbus A320 — one of the most widely used single-aisle aircraft globally — has multiple redundant safety systems designed to allow safe flight and landing even in the event of a single engine failure. The incident comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of aviation safety following several high-profile aircraft emergencies in recent years, and the NTSB investigation will focus on the cause of the engine malfunction, the crew's response, and the effectiveness of the emergency evacuation procedures. JetBlue confirmed it is rebooking all passengers on alternative flights and providing accommodation and meals for those whose travel was disrupted.

### 4. India's CRPF Establishes 43 High-Altitude Counter-Terror Bases in Jammu and Kashmir After Pahalgam Attack
*Feb 19*

> India's Central Reserve Police Force established 43 Temporary Operating Bases in mountainous terrain at altitudes near 6,000 feet across Jammu and Kashmir, significantly strengthening counter-terror deployment in vulnerable zones following the April 22, 2025 terrorist attack on tourists in the Baisaran meadow near Pahalgam, with each base housing 16-25 CRPF personnel operating alongside Jammu and Kashmir Police.

The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) established 43 Temporary Operating Bases (TOBs) in hilly terrains at altitudes of nearly 6,000 feet and above on February 19, significantly strengthening counter-terror deployment in vulnerable mountainous zones in Jammu and Kashmir. The move comes in the aftermath of the April 22, 2025 terrorist attack on tourists in the Baisaran meadow near Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in South Kashmir that resulted in multiple casualties and prompted a comprehensive reassessment of security protocols in high-altitude tourist areas. The CRPF, India's largest paramilitary force, established 26 TOBs in Kashmir in October 2025 and 17 additional bases in Jammu in November, bringing the total to 43 strategically positioned installations.

The bases have been positioned in difficult-to-access mountainous stretches to ensure round-the-clock surveillance, improved response time, and denial of safe havens to terrorist groups operating in the region. Each base houses between 16 and 25 CRPF personnel who operate alongside members of the Jammu and Kashmir Police in joint operations, and these teams occupy the bases for short durations while launching targeted search-and-assault operations in forested and high-altitude areas. The Temporary Operating Base model allows security forces to maintain a persistent presence in terrain that has historically been challenging to patrol and has served as infiltration routes and hideouts for militant groups.

The establishment of the high-altitude bases represents a significant shift in India's counter-terrorism strategy in Jammu and Kashmir, moving from reactive responses to proactive positioning in areas where tourists and pilgrims are most vulnerable. The April 2025 Pahalgam attack shocked Indian security agencies and prompted calls for more comprehensive protection of tourist sites, which have become increasingly targeted by terrorist groups seeking to damage the region's economy and undermine the perception of normalcy that Indian authorities have sought to project. The bases are equipped with advanced surveillance technology, communication systems, and are positioned to enable rapid deployment to multiple potential attack sites within their sectors.

### 5. Bulgaria Announces Snap Parliamentary Election for April 19 Following Government Resignation After Protests
*Feb 19*

> Bulgaria announced a snap parliamentary election scheduled for April 19, 2026, marking the eighth vote in just five years after the Zhelyazkov government resigned on December 11, 2025 following weeks of anticorruption protests over the 2026 draft budget, with President Iliana Iotova appointing Andrey Gyurov, deputy governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, to head a caretaker government preparing for the vote.

Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Bulgaria on April 19, 2026, following the resignation of the Zhelyazkov government on December 11, 2025, caused by weeks of anticorruption protests over the government's handling of the 2026 draft budget. This will be the eighth parliamentary election in just five years, reflecting the persistent political instability that has gripped Bulgaria since 2021 and prevented the formation of stable governing coalitions capable of addressing the country's economic challenges, corruption concerns, and institutional reforms. President Iliana Iotova announced the election date and tapped Andrey Gyurov, deputy governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, to head a caretaker government tasked with preparing the way for the vote.

People began taking to the streets in late November 2025 over the 2026 draft budget, with protesters branding it as an attempt to mask rampant corruption and divert public funds to politically connected networks. The demonstrations grew in size and intensity through December, eventually forcing the government to acknowledge it had lost public confidence and could not secure parliamentary support for key legislation. The protests reflected deep frustration with Bulgaria's political class, which has cycled through multiple governments and electoral configurations without producing meaningful progress on judicial reform, anti-corruption enforcement, or economic modernization — issues that have delayed Bulgaria's entry into the Eurozone and undermined the country's standing within the European Union.

The April 19 election comes at a critical moment for Bulgaria's European integration and economic development. The country remains the EU's poorest member state by per capita GDP, faces significant demographic decline as young Bulgarians emigrate for opportunities elsewhere in Europe, and has struggled to implement reforms required to unlock EU recovery funds allocated under the NextGenerationEU program. International observers and EU officials will watch the election closely to see whether Bulgarian voters can produce a stable governing majority capable of breaking the cycle of short-lived governments and advancing the institutional reforms needed to strengthen the rule of law and reduce corruption.

### 6. Pakistan's Punjab Police Accused of 900 Extrajudicial Killings in Eight Months as HRCP Demands Judicial Probe
*Feb 19*

> A Human Rights Commission of Pakistan fact-finding report published February 17 concludes that Punjab's Crime Control Department is pursuing "a systemic policy of extrajudicial killing in contravention of the law and Constitution," documenting at least 670 "encounters" resulting in 924 suspected deaths between April and December 2025, with an average of more than two fatal encounters per day indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated incidents.

A Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) fact-finding report published on February 17 concludes that Punjab's Crime Control Department (CCD) is pursuing "a systemic policy of extrajudicial killing in contravention of the law and Constitution," documenting at least 670 "encounters" resulting in 924 suspected deaths between April 2025, when the unit was formed, and December 2025. The "stark disparity," coupled with an average of more than two fatal encounters per day, indicated a systematic pattern rather than isolated incidents, according to the commission. The report has sparked intense domestic and international scrutiny of Pakistan's largest and most politically influential province, which is home to more than 110 million people and serves as the political base of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).

The HRCP documented particularly egregious cases including one instance in which five members of one family were killed in separate "police encounters" across different districts of Punjab within 24 hours — a mother's sons Imran (25), Irfan (23), and Adnan (18), along with two sons-in-law — raising serious questions about whether the killings were coordinated acts of targeted elimination rather than legitimate law enforcement operations. The commission recommended an immediate halt to encounter-based operations, mandatory Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) investigations under National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) supervision, the establishment of an independent civilian police oversight commission, and compensation for the families of those killed.

The CCD has dismissed the HRCP's concerns, saying the commission lacks evidence of extrajudicial killings and characterizing the encounters as legitimate operations against dangerous criminals who fired on police during arrest attempts. Punjab's government has defended the unit as necessary to combat rising crime, terrorism, and organized criminal networks, citing declining crime statistics in areas where the CCD operates. The controversy comes amid broader concerns about the rule of law and human rights in Pakistan, where security forces have long faced accusations of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture — practices that international human rights organizations and UN bodies have repeatedly condemned while calling for accountability and institutional reforms.

### 7. Australia Refuses to Repatriate 34 Women and Children With Alleged IS Links After Failed Syria Departure
*Feb 19*

> The Australian government announced on February 18 it will not repatriate a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the Islamic State group from Syria after Syrian authorities turned them back from Damascus to Roj camp due to procedural problems, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stating they will "face the full force of the law" if they manage to return to Australia independently, in a reversal of earlier repatriation efforts.

The Australian government announced on February 18 that it will not repatriate a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the Islamic State group from Syria, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, after Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to Roj camp in northeast Syria because of procedural problems. The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia but were prevented from departing at the last moment, creating a diplomatic impasse between Canberra and Damascus over responsibility for Australian citizens in Syrian detention camps. Albanese stated that if anyone from the latest group manages to find their way back to Australia without government help, "they'll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken."

Australia's government also banned an Australian citizen with alleged ties to the militant Islamic State group from returning home from the detention camp in Syria, using emergency powers under national security legislation to prevent the individual from entering Australian territory. The decision marks a significant shift from previous Australian policy: only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of the Islamic State group's territorial caliphate in 2019, with the last group arriving in Sydney in October 2022. Those earlier repatriations were conducted quietly and included predominantly women and children who Australian authorities assessed posed manageable security risks that could be addressed through monitoring, deradicalization programs, and prosecution where evidence warranted.

The reversal reflects changing domestic political calculations in Australia, where opposition politicians and security commentators have criticized repatriation efforts as placing Australian communities at risk from individuals who may have been radicalized or participated in terrorist activities in Syria and Iraq. Human rights organizations and international law experts have argued that Australia has obligations under international law to repatriate its citizens, particularly children born in the conflict zones who had no agency in their parents' decisions to travel to Islamic State-controlled territory. The situation in Syrian detention camps has deteriorated significantly, with humanitarian organizations warning of dire conditions, inadequate medical care, and growing radicalization among detainees as the camps remain under the control of Kurdish-led authorities who have repeatedly called on countries to repatriate their nationals.

### 8. US and Iran Report Progress in Geneva Nuclear Talks as White House Readies Military Strike Options
*Feb 19*

> US and Iranian officials concluded indirect nuclear talks in Geneva with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi declaring "good progress" and "broad agreement on a set of guiding principles" while a White House official simultaneously placed the chances of a US-Israel joint military strike on Iran "within weeks" at 90%, with Trump deploying two aircraft carriers to the Gulf region and more than 150 US military cargo flights moving weapons systems to the Middle East.

The second round of indirect nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran concluded Tuesday evening in Geneva with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declaring that "good progress" had been made, saying the two sides reached "broad agreement on a set of guiding principles" and would now work toward exchanging draft texts for a potential agreement. A US official confirmed Iran agreed to return within two weeks with detailed proposals to bridge the remaining gaps, and Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated between US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Araghchi, described the outcome as substantive progress. The cautiously optimistic language stops well short of declaring a deal is near, and significant divides remain that will complicate any framework agreement.

Washington has demanded that Iran halt all uranium enrichment on its soil and seeks to expand talks to cover Iran's ballistic missile program, while Tehran has flatly rejected the zero-enrichment demand and declared its missile capabilities entirely off the table. The negotiations occur against an extraordinarily tense military backdrop: Trump's armada has grown to include two aircraft carriers — the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Gerald R. Ford — a dozen warships, hundreds of fighter jets and multiple air defense systems, with more than 150 US military cargo flights having moved weapons systems and ammunition to the Middle East, and another 50 fighter jets (F-35s, F-22s, and F-16s) headed to the region in just the past 24 hours. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei simultaneously warned publicly that Iran has the capability to sink a US warship, a statement read by analysts as deterrence signaling timed to the talks.

The diplomatic track was overshadowed by separate reporting on February 18 that a White House official placed the chances of a US-Israel joint military strike on Iran "within weeks" at 90%, with Israeli officials reportedly preparing for war "within days" — a potential operation expected to be larger than last June's 12-day Israeli-led bombing campaign. Markets reacted immediately, with WTI crude oil jumping 2.6% to approximately $64 per barrel on the combined news. Vice President JD Vance confirmed the US has established "red lines" with Iran centered on preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The diplomatic and military tracks are running simultaneously, creating an extraordinary situation in which Geneva diplomacy and pre-strike military planning appear to be proceeding in parallel, with one Trump adviser stating there is a "90% chance we see kinetic action in the next few weeks."

### 9. Israel Begins Contentious West Bank Land Registration Process Targeting Area C as "State Property"
*Feb 19*

> Israel announced on February 16 it will begin a land regulation process across large portions of the occupied West Bank under which anyone with a claim to land must submit documents proving ownership, with an initial budget of $79 million allocated from 2026 to 2030 for registering Area C — the 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli military control — as "state property," drawing accusations from the Palestinian Authority of "de facto annexation" and a "mega land grab."

Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in Israel gaining control over wide swaths of the area for future development, according to a government decision announced Sunday, February 16. The decision paves the way for the resumption of "settlement of land title" processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Mideast War in 1967. When Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership — a requirement that effectively targets any land in Area C that Palestinians cannot prove ownership of with formal documentation, which is often unavailable due to the disruption of Ottoman-era and Jordanian-era land records and the displacement of Palestinian communities over decades.

Area C refers to the 60% of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians under the Oslo Accords framework. An initial budget of $79 million has been allocated for the land registration process in Area C from 2026 to 2030, signaling the Israeli government's intention to pursue the program systematically across a wide geographic area. The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the process likely amounts to a "mega land grab" from Palestinians, while Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' office called the decision "a grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law" that amounts to "de facto annexation" of Palestinian territory.

The land registration initiative comes at a time of heightened Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and follows Trump administration signals that Washington will not oppose Israeli territorial expansion in the territory. International law experts note that the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits an occupying power from transferring civilian population into occupied territory and from making permanent changes to the status of that territory, principles that underpin decades of international consensus that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal. The land registration process threatens to formalize Israeli control over vast areas of the West Bank that have been under military occupation since 1967 but not formally annexed, potentially foreclosing the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian state — a prospect that has been the foundation of international peace efforts for decades.

### 10. North Korea Opens Pyongyang Housing District for Families of Soldiers Killed Fighting in Russia-Ukraine War
*Feb 19*

> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended a completion ceremony on February 15 for a new housing district called Saeppyol Street in Pyongyang designated for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, pledging to repay the "young martyrs" who "sacrificed all to their motherland," as South Korea's National Intelligence Service estimates 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during deployment.

North Korea completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attending a completion ceremony of the new street, called Saeppyol Street, on Sunday, February 15, 2026. State media photos showed Kim walking through the new street and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju-ae, as he pledged to repay the "young martyrs" who "sacrificed all to their motherland." The new housing complex represents a significant propaganda investment by the regime as it seeks to manage domestic perceptions of North Korea's military involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service estimated in February that 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during their deployment to Russia, representing significant casualties for a deployment that Western intelligence agencies initially estimated involved approximately 10,000 to 12,000 North Korean soldiers sent to support Russian operations in late 2025. Pyongyang has intensified propaganda efforts glorifying troops deployed to Russia in recent months, establishing a memorial wall and building a museum dedicated to the war, with analysts viewing the campaign as an attempt to bolster internal unity and pre-empt potential public discontent over the human costs of the deployment, which has not been publicly acknowledged by North Korean state media in terms of specific casualty figures.

The housing district opening ceremony was broadcast on North Korean state television and presented as fulfillment of Kim Jong Un's promise to care for the families of fallen soldiers, a traditional element of North Korean propaganda that emphasizes the regime's paternal care for military families. The provision of Pyongyang housing — a scarce and highly valued commodity in North Korea — to families of soldiers killed abroad signals the regime's recognition that the Russia deployment carries political risks domestically and requires compensatory measures to maintain military morale and public support. International observers note the ceremony provides indirect confirmation of significant North Korean military involvement in Ukraine, a deployment that has strengthened the Russia-North Korea military partnership and provided Pyongyang with combat experience, weapons technology transfers, and economic support from Moscow.

### 1. Walmart Beats Q4 Earnings Expectations But Stock Falls on Cautious Full-Year Guidance
*Feb 19*

> Walmart reported Q4 fiscal 2026 revenue of $190.66 billion versus $190.43 billion expected and adjusted EPS of $0.74 beating the $0.73 estimate, with comparable US sales rising 4.6% and e-commerce sales surging 27% for the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit digital gains, but shares fell 1.5% in premarket trading as the company's full-year outlook for 3.5%-4.5% net sales growth and $2.75-$2.85 adjusted EPS disappointed investors seeking stronger forward guidance.

Walmart reported Q4 fiscal 2026 results on February 19, beating Wall Street's revenue and earnings estimates but falling in premarket trading on disappointing forward guidance. Revenue for the quarter reached $190.66 billion versus $190.43 billion expected, representing an increase from $180.55 billion in the year-ago quarter and approximately 6% year-over-year growth. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.74, surpassing expectations of $0.73 per share, and comparable sales jumped 4.6% for Walmart's U.S. business and 4% for Sam's Club in the fourth quarter, excluding fuel — metrics reflecting sustained strength in the company's core operations and the continued shift of higher-income households to Walmart from traditional grocery and general merchandise competitors.

Walmart's e-commerce sales in the US rose 27% compared with the year-ago period, marking the company's 15th straight quarter of double-digit digital gains and underscoring the structural transformation of the retailer under CEO Doug McMillon from a brick-and-mortar operator to a technology-driven omnichannel platform. Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told CNBC the company again had strong gains in e-commerce and online pickup and delivery orders, particularly among higher-income consumers. Approximately 75% of Walmart's recent market share gains have come from households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000 — a striking demographic shift that indicates premium consumers are trading down to Walmart amid elevated prices across discretionary categories and concerns about the economic outlook.

For the full current fiscal year, Walmart expects net sales to increase by 3.5% to 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.75 to $2.85 — guidance that came in below analysts' expectations for stronger growth and contributed to the stock's 1.5% decline in premarket trading. The company's forward outlook reflects caution about the consumer environment amid tariff concerns, government spending cuts under the Trump administration's DOGE initiative, and elevated prices that are beginning to pressure discretionary spending. Despite the guidance miss, Walmart crossed the $1 trillion market capitalization threshold in 2025 and moved its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq in December, positioning the company as a technology-driven retailer rather than purely a brick-and-mortar operator.

### 2. Federal Reserve January FOMC Minutes Reveal Division on Rate Path as Some Officials Consider Potential Hikes
*Feb 19*

> Federal Reserve officials at their January 27-28 meeting indicated that further interest rate cuts should be paused for now, with some officials even entertaining the notion that rate hikes could be on the table and wanting the post-meeting statement to reflect "the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels," as the Committee voted to maintain rates at 3.5%-3.75% with two dissenting officials preferring a quarter-point cut.

Divided Federal Reserve officials at their January 27-28 meeting indicated that further interest rate cuts should be paused for now, with members conflicted between fighting inflation and supporting the labor market, according to the official minutes released on February 18. Some officials even entertained the notion that rate hikes could be on the table and wanted the post-meeting statement to reflect "the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels," language that reflects a more hawkish stance than the eventual statement conveyed. Most participants cautioned that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective might be slower and more uneven than generally expected and judged that the risk of inflation running persistently above the Committee's objective was meaningful.

The Committee voted at the January meeting to maintain the federal funds rate target range at 3.5%-3.75%, pausing the easing cycle that had produced three consecutive cuts in the prior year, with two dissenting voting members preferring a quarter-point cut reflecting concerns that the economic deceleration is more pronounced than the majority acknowledged. The minutes provide detail on how extensively the Committee discussed the tariff risk, with Trump's import taxes now at their highest weighted average level since 1946 and producer price data showing businesses beginning to pass tariff costs to consumers. The degree to which individual FOMC members viewed tariffs as a temporary shock versus a persistent inflation factor will provide important guidance on the Fed's likely response function in coming months.

U.S. Treasury yields ticked higher after the Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed division on the future of monetary policy, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising more than 3 basis points to 4.087%, and the 2-year Treasury note yield also more than 3 basis points higher at 3.468%. Most major firms have pushed their expectations for the next rate cut to June 2026, though a vocal minority including Citigroup suggests a move could come as early as April if employment data begins to soften. Fed Governor Michael Barr's comments on February 18 that rates "may need to remain restrictive for some time" sent bank stocks higher by reinforcing net interest margin expectations, while Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair when his term expires in May adds a political dimension to the rate outlook.

### 3. Oil Prices Surge on US-Iran War Risk as IRGC Conducts Strait of Hormuz Military Drills

> Brent crude climbed 0.3% to $70.58 per barrel and WTI gained 0.4% to $65.44 on February 19 as traders priced in supply disruption risk following reports of an imminent US military strike on Iran, while Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps concluded "Smart Control of Hormuz Strait" naval exercises including temporary closure of sections of the strategic waterway through which approximately 20-30% of global daily oil consumption transits.

Brent futures climbed 23 cents, or 0.3% to $70.58 a barrel on February 19, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 25 cents, or 0.4%, to trade at $65.44 a barrel, as traders priced in the risk of supply disruptions in the event of a US-Iran conflict. Both benchmarks settled more than 4% higher on Wednesday, February 18, posting their highest settlements since January 30, as senior US national security officials informed Trump that the military is ready for potential strikes on Iran as early as Saturday, February 21. The potential for military action against Iran — which controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which approximately 20-30% of global petroleum consumption passes — represents a profound supply disruption risk that overwhelmed bearish signals from ongoing US-Iran nuclear diplomacy in Geneva.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted military drills in the strategically important waterway, closing parts of the strait for a few hours on February 16-17 due to "security precautions" as a warning to Washington ahead of the Geneva nuclear talks. The drill, named "Smart Control of Hormuz Strait," aimed at testing the readiness of operational forces in the face of "possible security and military threats," and was directly supervised by IRGC Chief Commander Major General Mohammad Pakpour. The exercises also involved vessels from the Russian Navy and the Chinese Navy in a larger trilateral operation that began on February 19 in the Hormuz Strait and Sea of Oman, described by participants as drills to "enhance security and sustainable maritime interactions in the Sea of Oman and the northern Indian Ocean."

The oil market has been under sustained structural downward pressure ahead of recent days' spike, with the US Energy Information Administration's February 2026 Short-Term Energy Outlook forecast Brent crude averaging just $58 per barrel for the full year 2026, reflecting expectations of oversupply from non-OPEC producers, weakening Chinese demand growth, and the gradual reopening of Iranian oil supply under a potential nuclear settlement. Technical analysis entering February 18 had pointed to potential downside targets in the $59-60 range, making the week's surge a sharp reversal of the established short-term trend. Energy traders are now pricing significant conflict risk premium into crude futures while simultaneously monitoring the Geneva diplomatic track, creating a market environment defined by exceptional uncertainty across the full spectrum of outcomes from deal to war.

### 4. US Jobless Claims Fall to 206,000, Beating Expectations as Labor Market Remains Stable
*Feb 19*

> Initial jobless claims decreased by 23,000 to 206,000 in the week ended February 14, marking a significant decline and the strongest improvement since November, substantially beating the median forecast of 225,000 in a Bloomberg survey as continuing claims inched higher by 17,000 to 1,869,000, reflecting a stable labor market with slow firing momentum offsetting soft hiring momentum.

Initial claims decreased by 23,000 to 206,000 in the week ended February 14, marking a significant decline from the prior week's 229,000 and representing the strongest improvement in jobless claims since November 2025. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 225,000, so the actual figure came in substantially better than expectations and provided evidence that the labor market remains stable despite concerns about economic deceleration and the impact of Trump administration policy changes. The data continued to reflect a labor market with slow firing momentum offsetting soft hiring momentum, consistent with the Federal Reserve's view that employment conditions remain solid if unspectacular.

Continuing claims, which serve as a proxy for outstanding unemployment in the US, inched higher by 17,000 to 1,869,000, indicating that while new layoffs remain constrained, workers who do lose jobs are taking somewhat longer to find new employment — a dynamic consistent with a cooling but not collapsing labor market. The improvement in initial claims comes after a spike in mid-to-late January when applications for US unemployment benefits rose by more than forecast as severe winter weather gripped much of the country, disrupting business operations and temporarily elevating layoffs. The labor market has since stabilized with the latest reading showing resilience despite headwinds from government spending cuts, tariff uncertainty, and Federal Reserve monetary tightening.

The jobless claims data released February 19 will factor into the Federal Reserve's assessment of labor market conditions as officials debate the timing and pace of potential future rate cuts. The January FOMC meeting minutes released February 18 showed that two dissenting officials preferred a quarter-point cut reflecting concerns about labor market softening, though the majority viewed employment conditions as sufficiently solid to justify pausing further easing. Economists note that initial claims below 250,000 historically indicate a healthy labor market with low layoff risk, though the level of continuing claims suggests some cooling in hiring demand that bears monitoring in coming months.

### 5. Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index Surges to 16.3, Beating Expectations as Activity Strengthens
*Feb 19*

> The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey for February 2026 came in at 16.3, significantly higher than the forecasted 7.5 and the January reading of 12.6, indicating robust manufacturing sector strength in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve district as a level above zero signals improving conditions and the substantial outperformance against predictions points to more resilient regional manufacturing than anticipated.

The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey for February 2026 stood at 16.3, significantly higher than the forecasted 7.5 and representing a marked increase from the January reading of 12.6, highlighting a continuing upward trend in the region's manufacturing industry. The substantial outperformance against the predicted number indicates a more robust manufacturing sector in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve district than initially anticipated, providing evidence that industrial activity is holding up better than many analysts expected despite headwinds from elevated interest rates, tariff uncertainty, and concerns about the broader economic outlook. A level above zero on the index indicates improving conditions, while below zero indicates worsening conditions.

The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is compiled from a survey of about 250 manufacturers in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve district, which includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware, and is considered a leading indicator of broader industrial activity trends. The February reading reflects continued strength across multiple components of manufacturing activity, including new orders, shipments, and employment, with the index showing consistent improvement from depressed levels recorded in late 2025. The upbeat manufacturing data contrasts with concerns that Trump administration tariffs — now at their highest weighted average level since 1946 — would significantly disrupt supply chains and reduce business confidence.

The stronger-than-expected manufacturing data released February 19 provides some support for Federal Reserve officials who argued at the January FOMC meeting that the economy retains sufficient momentum to justify pausing rate cuts despite calls from dissenting members to continue easing. Regional Fed manufacturing surveys, including the Philadelphia Fed and Empire State indices, are closely watched by economists and market participants for early signals about the health of the industrial sector, which has been a source of volatility in the US economy over the past year. The February reading suggests that manufacturers in the Mid-Atlantic region are experiencing improving conditions despite the challenging macro environment.

### 6. Quanta Services Reports Strong Q4 Results and Issues Upbeat 2026 Guidance, Shares Rise 4%
*Feb 19*

> Quanta Services reported Q4 2025 revenues of $7.84 billion compared to $6.55 billion in Q4 2024, with net income attributable to common stock of $315.5 million or $2.08 per diluted share, and adjusted earnings of $3.16 per share surpassing the analyst consensus of $3.02, as the company issued full-year 2026 EPS guidance of $12.65-$13.35 compared to consensus of $11.98 and revenue guidance of $33.3-$33.8 billion versus consensus of $31.2 billion, driving shares up more than 4%.

Quanta Services announced its Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2025 results on February 19, reporting revenues in the fourth quarter of 2025 of $7.84 billion compared to revenues of $6.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, representing approximately 20% year-over-year growth. Net income attributable to common stock was $315.5 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, compared to $305.1 million, or $2.03 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company posted adjusted earnings of $3.16 per share for the fourth quarter, surpassing the analyst consensus of $3.02 and reflecting the continued strength of Quanta's position as a leading provider of infrastructure solutions for electric power, renewable energy, telecommunications, and pipeline sectors.

The company provided full-year 2026 guidance that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations, calling for EPS of $12.65-$13.35 for the period compared to the consensus EPS estimate of $11.98, and revenue guidance of $33.3 billion-$33.8 billion compared to the consensus revenue estimate of $31.2 billion. The upbeat guidance reflects Quanta's backlog of contracted work across its core infrastructure sectors, particularly electric grid modernization, renewable energy interconnection projects, and telecommunications fiber deployment — areas experiencing sustained demand driven by the AI data center buildout, electric vehicle adoption, and the energy transition. Shares of Quanta Services rose more than 4% in regular trading on February 19 following the earnings release and guidance announcement.

Quanta's strong performance and optimistic outlook underscore the company's strategic positioning at the intersection of multiple long-duration infrastructure investment themes, including the upgrading of aging U.S. electric transmission and distribution systems, the build-out of renewable energy generation and storage capacity, and the expansion of high-speed telecommunications networks required to support AI and cloud computing workloads. The company has benefited from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act — federal programs that are driving significant public and private investment in the sectors where Quanta operates. Analysts note that Quanta's multi-year visibility into revenue and earnings makes the stock attractive in an environment of macroeconomic uncertainty.

### 7. US Trade Deficit Widens to $70.3 Billion in December as Imports Surge $12.3 Billion
*Feb 19*

> The US Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis announced on February 19 that the goods and services deficit was $70.3 billion in December 2025, up $17.3 billion from $53.0 billion in November, as December exports fell $5.0 billion to $287.3 billion while December imports surged $12.3 billion to $357.6 billion, with the goods deficit increasing $15.7 billion to $99.3 billion and the services surplus decreasing $1.6 billion to $29.0 billion.

The US Census Bureau and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis announced on February 19 that the goods and services deficit was $70.3 billion in December 2025, up $17.3 billion from $53.0 billion in November, representing one of the largest month-over-month increases in the trade deficit in recent years. December exports were $287.3 billion, $5.0 billion less than November exports, while December imports were $357.6 billion, $12.3 billion more than November imports, creating a combination of declining exports and surging imports that widened the deficit significantly. The December increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of $15.7 billion to $99.3 billion and a decrease in the services surplus of $1.6 billion to $29.0 billion.

For the full year 2025, the goods and services deficit decreased $2.1 billion, or 0.2 percent, from 2024, with the annual deficit totaling $901.5 billion compared to $903.5 billion in 2024 — a marginal improvement that reflects relatively stable trade dynamics over the year despite significant policy changes and global economic volatility. The full-year data shows that while the trade deficit remains near historic highs, it has not widened dramatically despite Trump administration tariffs and shifts in global supply chains. The December surge in imports likely reflects businesses front-loading purchases ahead of anticipated new tariffs announced by the Trump administration for implementation in 2026, a pattern observed in previous periods of trade policy uncertainty.

The trade data released February 19 will factor into upcoming revisions to fourth quarter 2025 GDP, with the widening trade deficit representing a drag on GDP growth as imports subtract from the consumption and investment components that drive headline economic output. Economists note that the persistent US trade deficit — which has averaged more than $800 billion annually in recent years — reflects structural factors including the dollar's role as the global reserve currency, higher US consumption relative to production, and the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to lower-cost jurisdictions over decades. The Trump administration has identified the trade deficit as a priority target for policy intervention, using tariffs as the primary tool to rebalance trade flows, though economists debate whether tariffs can meaningfully reduce the deficit without addressing underlying fiscal and savings imbalances.

### 8. Meta Expands Nvidia Partnership in Multi-Billion Dollar AI Chip Deal Covering Millions of GPUs and New CPUs
*Feb 19*

> Nvidia announced a multiyear, multigenerational strategic partnership with Meta spanning on-premises, cloud and AI infrastructure, with Meta deploying millions of Nvidia Blackwell and Rubin GPUs as well as integrating Nvidia Spectrum-X Ethernet switches, and continuing to partner on deploying Arm-based Nvidia Grace CPUs for Meta's data center production applications in the first large-scale Nvidia Grace-only deployment, in a deal estimated by analysts to be worth tens of billions of dollars.

Nvidia announced a multiyear, multigenerational strategic partnership with Meta spanning on-premises, cloud and AI infrastructure, representing an expansion of the companies' existing relationship into what analysts estimate is a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. The partnership covers a comprehensive set of Nvidia's offerings, with Meta deploying millions of Nvidia Blackwell and Rubin GPUs for AI training and inference workloads, integrating Nvidia Spectrum-X Ethernet switches for Meta's Facebook Open Switching System platform, and continuing to partner on deploying Arm-based Nvidia Grace CPUs for Meta's data center production applications. The collaboration represents the first large-scale Nvidia Grace-only deployment, delivering significant performance-per-watt improvements in Meta's data centers.

Financial terms of the deal were not provided by either company, but chip analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies stated the deal is certainly in the tens of billions of dollars, making it one of the largest technology procurement arrangements announced in 2026. The multiyear deal is part of Meta's overall commitment to spend $600 billion in the U.S. by 2028 on data centers and the infrastructure the facilities require, an investment program that underscores the extraordinary capital intensity of AI model training and deployment at the scale Meta is pursuing. The company is building AI infrastructure to support its next-generation recommendation systems, large language models for consumer products, and metaverse computing workloads.

The expanded partnership positions Nvidia as Meta's primary AI chip supplier across multiple generations of hardware, providing Nvidia with revenue visibility and cementing its dominance in the AI accelerator market at a moment when competitors including AMD, Intel, and custom chip designers are attempting to challenge Nvidia's market share. For Meta, the deal secures access to cutting-edge AI chips at a time when global demand for advanced GPUs far exceeds supply, and the integration of Nvidia's networking technology addresses one of the key bottlenecks in large-scale AI training: moving data between thousands of GPUs at speeds required to minimize training time. The announcement drove Nvidia shares higher in regular trading on February 19.

### 9. Warner Bros. Discovery Reopens Paramount Talks After Netflix Grants Limited Waiver Through February 23
*Feb 19*

> Warner Bros. Discovery announced on February 17 it is reopening deal discussions with Paramount Skydance after Netflix granted a limited waiver permitting WBD to engage with Paramount for a seven-day window ending February 23, setting up a climactic media consolidation showdown before a March 20 shareholder vote on the existing Netflix merger, as Paramount CEO David Ellison sweetened his offer to $31 per share with a commitment to cover the $2.8 billion Netflix breakup fee and a "ticking fee" of $650 million per quarter if the deal is not completed by end of 2026.

Warner Bros. Discovery announced on February 17 that it is reopening deal discussions with Paramount Skydance after Netflix granted a limited waiver under the terms of WBD's existing merger agreement with the streaming giant, permitting WBD to engage with Paramount Skydance for a seven-day window ending February 23, 2026. The development sets up a dramatic climax to one of the most complex media consolidation sagas in decades: WBD agreed in December to sell most of itself — including the Warner Bros. movie studio, HBO, and its streaming assets — to Netflix for $72 billion in equity at $27.72 a share, while cable channels including CNN were excluded from that deal. Paramount CEO David Ellison responded by going directly to WBD shareholders with a competing all-cash offer initially at $30 per share for the entire company including CNN, later sweetened to $31 per share in a revised proposal delivered February 10.

Paramount's sweetened February offer added significant inducements designed to make the deal economically compelling: a promise to cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee WBD would owe Netflix if it abandoned the streaming deal, a commitment to backstop a refinancing that would cut WBD's debt costs by $1.5 billion, and a "ticking fee" of $650 million per quarter in cash if the Paramount-WBD deal is not completed by end of 2026. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos responded with characteristic confidence, telling media "let them make a move," while confirming Netflix's merger agreement with WBD remains the company's preferred outcome and stating "while we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY's antics."

WBD announced it will hold a special shareholder meeting on March 20 at which it will recommend voting to approve the Netflix deal, meaning the one-week Paramount window running through February 23 is a genuine opportunity for Paramount to make a case to the WBD board that its offer materially exceeds the Netflix deal's value to shareholders. The outcome will help determine whether Hollywood's most coveted content library — including Warner Bros.' DC Comics franchise, Harry Potter, and HBO's prestige television catalog — combines with Netflix's distribution platform or becomes part of a reconstituted old-media giant under Ellison's Paramount umbrella. The combined WBD-Netflix entity would be valued at approximately $100 billion including debt, while a WBD-Paramount combination would create an $80 billion company.

### 10. Sumitomo Forestry to Acquire Tri Pointe Homes for $4.5 Billion, Becoming 5th-Largest US Homebuilder
*Feb 19*

> Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Forestry announced a definitive agreement on February 13 to acquire Irvine-based Tri Pointe Homes for $47 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion — a 29% premium to Tri Pointe's prior closing price and a 42% premium to the company's 90-day volume weighted average price — that would make Sumitomo the fifth-largest US homebuilder by closings with more than 18,000 units annually, in a major cross-border bet on the structural US housing shortage.

Sumitomo Forestry, one of Japan's largest residential construction and real estate conglomerates, announced a definitive agreement on February 13 to acquire Irvine, California-based Tri Pointe Homes for $47.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion, representing a 29% premium to Tri Pointe's closing stock price on February 12, 2026, and a 42% premium to the company's 90-day volume weighted average price. The deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026 subject to Tri Pointe shareholder approval and customary regulatory conditions, would make Sumitomo the fifth-largest US homebuilder by annual closings — combining its existing US group operations with Tri Pointe's more than 150 active communities across 13 high-growth states to produce roughly 18,000 units per year.

Tri Pointe brings a premium homebuilding brand with 17 active divisions and significant presence in high-demand Sun Belt markets including California, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and the Carolinas — areas experiencing the strongest population growth and housing supply constraints in the country. Sumitomo will maintain Tri Pointe as a distinct brand led by its existing management team under CEO Doug Bauer, preserving the company's operational identity and relationships with land sellers, municipal permitting authorities, and subcontractor networks that are critical to homebuilding execution. Sumitomo Forestry's US strategy has been steadily expanding through a series of acquisitions of regional homebuilders over the past decade as Japanese investors have sought exposure to the structural American housing shortage.

The transaction reflects both the persistent US housing deficit — estimated at 3.5 to 7 million units below long-term demographic demand — and the growing appeal of the US homebuilding sector to sophisticated foreign capital seeking inflation-resistant real assets with durable demand. Sumitomo's $4.5 billion all-cash bid comes at a moment when US homebuilder stocks have experienced significant volatility due to elevated mortgage rates, tariff uncertainty affecting construction materials costs, and slower than expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. The deal's announcement on February 13 sent Tri Pointe shares surging toward the $47 offer price, and analysts at Nikkei Asia noted the acquisition would make Sumitomo a formidable player in the American residential market for the long term.
