### 1. Ukraine-Russia Geneva Talks End in Stalemate as Medinsky Says New Round Coming "Soon"
*Feb 18*

> US-mediated Ukraine-Russia peace talks concluded their second and final day in Geneva on Wednesday with both sides describing the sessions as "difficult," as Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky confirmed further talks would be scheduled while Axios reported the negotiations reached an impasse over Moscow's sweeping political demands on Kyiv.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations completed the second and final day of U.S.-brokered peace negotiations in Geneva on February 18 at the InterContinental Geneva Hotel, wrapping up a two-day trilateral session that included American, Russian, and Ukrainian teams in a format closed to the press. Russia's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky described the sessions as "difficult, but business-like," while Kyiv's delegation said the talks were "substantive" and that progress had been achieved. American envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner led the US side of mediation, with Trump continuing to publicly pressure Kyiv to move quickly toward a settlement before his self-imposed summer deadline.

Beneath the diplomatic language, the gaps between the parties remain enormous. The American outlet Axios reported that the talks reached a fundamental impasse over Russia's political demands, including Moscow's insistence that Ukraine formally cede Russian-occupied territories and withdraw further from remaining Ukrainian-controlled portions of the Donbas — a red line Kyiv has categorically rejected. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated in his nightly address that "we are ready to move quickly toward a worthy agreement to end the war," while simultaneously declaring Ukrainian forces now prepared to monitor any ceasefire "should there be political will to enforce it." The tone from Zelensky suggested conditional openness rather than genuine flexibility on territorial questions.

The Geneva round followed prior US-brokered sessions in Abu Dhabi that also ended without breakthrough, and analysts note that each negotiating round has produced similar diplomatic language about "progress" while the substantive gulf on territorial, security, and nuclear-plant questions remains unresolved. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — Europe's largest, currently under Russian military occupation — remains a central point of contention, as does Ukraine's demand for binding postwar security guarantees from Western nations. Medinsky confirmed that another round of talks would take place "in the near future," keeping the diplomatic channel open even as battlefield operations continue on all fronts. European capitals are watching the process with mounting anxiety that Trump's compressed timeline may result in an agreement that sacrifices durable security for cosmetic diplomatic optics.

### 2. US and Iran Report "Broad Agreement on Guiding Principles" in Geneva Nuclear Talks; War Fears Surge Simultaneously
*Feb 18*

> Running parallel to the Ukraine negotiations in the same Swiss city, US and Iranian officials concluded a second round of indirect nuclear talks in Geneva with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi declaring the sides reached "broad agreement on a set of guiding principles" and Iran agreeing to return with detailed proposals within two weeks — even as separate reporting placed White House estimates of an imminent US-Israel military strike on Iran at 90%.

The second round of indirect nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran concluded Tuesday evening in Geneva, mediated by Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi between US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Araghchi declared that "good progress" had been made, saying the two sides reached "broad agreement on a set of guiding principles" and would now work toward exchanging draft texts for a potential agreement. A US official confirmed Iran agreed to return within two weeks with detailed proposals to bridge the remaining gaps. The Omani mediator described the outcome as substantive, cautiously optimistic language that stops well short of declaring a deal is near.

Significant divides remain that will complicate any framework agreement. Washington has demanded that Iran halt all uranium enrichment on its soil and seeks to expand talks to cover Iran's ballistic missile program. Tehran has flatly rejected the zero-enrichment demand and declared its missile capabilities entirely off the table. The negotiations occur against an extraordinarily tense military backdrop: the US has deployed two aircraft carriers to the Gulf region, with the USS Abraham Lincoln positioned approximately 700km from the Iranian coast. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei simultaneously warned publicly that Iran has the capability to sink a US warship, a statement read by analysts as deterrence signaling timed to the talks.

The diplomatic track was overshadowed by separate reporting on February 18 that a White House official placed the chances of a US-Israel joint military strike on Iran "within weeks" at 90%, with Israeli officials reportedly preparing for war "within days" — a potential operation expected to be larger than last June's 12-day Israeli-led bombing campaign. Markets reacted immediately, with WTI crude oil jumping 2.6% to approximately $64 per barrel on the combined news. Vice President JD Vance confirmed the US has established "red lines" with Iran centered on preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The diplomatic and military tracks are running simultaneously, creating an extraordinary situation in which Geneva diplomacy and pre-strike military planning appear to be proceeding in parallel.

### 3. DRC Ceasefire With Rwanda-Backed M23 Set to Take Effect Today as UN Monitors Move In
*Feb 18*

> Angola's proposed ceasefire between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group was scheduled to take effect on February 18, with UN mission chief Vivian van de Perre meeting M23 leaders in rebel-held Goma to discuss monitoring mechanisms, even as the M23 claimed it had "not been informed or invited" about the Angola-brokered arrangement, raising serious doubts about implementation.

An Angola-proposed ceasefire between the Democratic Republic of Congo's government and the M23 rebel movement — which seized the eastern city of Goma in January 2025 and Bukavu the following month — was scheduled to take effect on February 18, with DRC President Félix Tshisekedi having formally accepted "the principle" of the ceasefire and the key provisions: an "immediate freezing of positions" and the cessation of military reinforcements and offensive operations. Bloomberg reported the arrangement as a breakthrough in regional mediation, representing the most significant diplomatic attempt to halt fighting that has created what the UN describes as one of the world's worst active humanitarian crises.

Implementation faces immediate complications. The M23 rebel movement stated it had "not been informed or invited" about the ceasefire proposed by Angola, accusing Kinshasa of "repeated ceasefire violations" even as the agreement was being announced, and casting serious doubt on whether the proposed freeze will hold in practice. Kinshasa has also yet to provide a definitive public declaration of acceptance of the specific February 18 effective date, leaving the terms in a state of diplomatic ambiguity. Acting UN peacekeeping mission chief Vivian van de Perre traveled to rebel-held Goma on Friday to meet directly with M23 leadership and discuss a ceasefire monitoring mechanism, with MONUSCO potentially playing a role in verifying compliance on a front line stretching hundreds of kilometers across South Kivu and North Kivu provinces.

The eastern DRC conflict has displaced more than 7 million people and created acute famine conditions across territories now under M23 and Rwanda's de facto control. International pressure for a settlement has intensified following a Bloomberg report confirming Congo has struck the ceasefire arrangement with the Rwanda-backed group in what would be a genuine breakthrough if implemented, and the UN Security Council has weighed further measures including expanded sanctions on Rwanda for its support of M23. The ceasefire's viability will depend heavily on whether Rwanda's government — which maintains that its forces are present only to protect against Rwandan Hutu militants along the border — agrees to withdraw troops from Congolese territory, a precondition Kinshasa has consistently demanded.

### 4. Macron Visits India for AI Summit and Rafale Deal; Partnership Elevated to "Special Global Strategic" Level
*Feb 18*

> French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in New Delhi on February 18 for the India AI Impact Summit at Bharat Mandapam, with Modi and Macron agreeing to elevate the India-France bilateral relationship to a "Special Global Strategic Partnership" and announcing 21 cooperation outcomes across defense, AI, nuclear energy, and space — including progress on a $38 billion deal for 114 Rafale jets to be co-produced in India.

French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in New Delhi on February 18 for the India AI Impact Summit 2026, the second stop of a four-day official visit to India that began in Mumbai on February 17. Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed Macron with full state honors, and the two leaders announced an elevation of the India-France relationship to a "Special Global Strategic Partnership" — a designation reflecting the deepening of ties across defense technology, artificial intelligence, civil nuclear energy, and space cooperation. The two leaders jointly inaugurated the India-France Year of Innovation 2026 and addressed business leaders, researchers, and start-ups from both countries at the Bharat Mandapam summit venue.

The centerpiece defense component of the visit involves 114 Rafale multi-role fighter jets valued at approximately ₹3.25 lakh crore ($38 billion), a deal that has received clearance from India's Defence Acquisition Council. Under the proposed structure, 18 aircraft would be delivered directly from France while 96 would be co-produced in India under the Make in India defence manufacturing initiative, representing a major expansion of France's role in India's military modernization program. The AI cooperation framework announced at the summit focuses on digital governance, cybersecurity, and joint research initiatives, with both nations positioning themselves as middle-power architects of what Macron described as AI governance suited to a "changing international order."

The visit carries strategic weight beyond bilateral ties, coming at a moment when India is carefully navigating relationships with the US, France, Russia, and China simultaneously. Macron has made deepening European-Indian strategic ties a priority as traditional transatlantic alignments shift under Trump's America First doctrine, and India's market of 1.4 billion people plus its rapidly expanding AI and defense industrial base make it an indispensable partner for Paris's ambitions as a technology and military power in the Indo-Pacific. The trip produced 21 formal cooperation outcomes spanning defense manufacturing, nuclear reactor cooperation under existing civil nuclear agreements, space sector joint ventures, and bilateral AI research funding.

### 5. Gaza Ceasefire Death Toll Surpasses 600 as Trump's "Board of Peace" Prepares Inaugural Meeting
*Feb 18*

> Despite a nominal ceasefire in effect since October 10, 2025, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza reported 603 people killed and more than 1,600 injured since the agreement took force, with the Gaza Government Media Office documenting 1,620 Israeli ceasefire violations, as Trump's newly formed Board of Peace prepares its inaugural Washington meeting on February 19 with $5 billion in reconstruction pledges and an International Stabilization Force announcement expected.

The Gaza ceasefire, which nominally took effect on October 10, 2025, has produced a mounting death toll that has now crossed 600 Palestinians killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Gaza Government Media Office documented at least 1,620 Israeli violations of the ceasefire between October 10, 2025 and February 10, 2026, through air strikes, artillery fire, and direct shootings. Humanitarian aid continues to fall dramatically short of agreed levels, with only 31,178 out of an allocated 72,000 trucks having entered Gaza — just 43% of the target — leaving the territory's 2.1 million residents facing acute shortages of food, medicine, and shelter as the Islamic holy month of Ramadan began on February 18.

An Israeli government minister issued a 60-day ultimatum to Hamas threatening renewed full-scale military operations if the group does not disarm, a demand Hamas leadership has already publicly and categorically rejected on the grounds that disarmament while Israeli occupation continues is not negotiable. The second phase of the Gaza peace plan — which was announced by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on January 14 — remains formally in effect but deeply contested, with fundamental disagreements over the scope of Israeli military withdrawal, the future governance structure of the territory, and the role of international forces in any transition unresolved.

Trump's newly formed "Board of Peace" — a US-led body established in mid-January 2026 to oversee Gaza's reconstruction, security transition, and political future — will hold its inaugural meeting in Washington on February 19 at the Institute of Peace, which Trump recently rebranded in his own honor. The board currently has 27 member nations chaired by Trump, including Middle East powers Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt. Member states have pledged more than $5 billion toward rebuilding Gaza, according to Trump, and the president is expected to formally announce the next phase of his Gaza plan: the deployment of an International Stabilization Force, with several countries planning to contribute several thousand troops to the force.

### 6. Trump Discusses Taiwan Arms Sales with Xi; PROTECT Taiwan Act Passes House
*Feb 18*

> President Trump disclosed he is actively discussing future US arms sales to Taiwan directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping and will make a decision "soon," as the House passed the PROTECT Taiwan Act threatening China's exclusion from international financial institutions if Beijing threatens Taiwan's security, and as the CCP held its annual Taiwan Work Conference setting 2026 strategy around weakening US-Taiwan supply chains and undermining Taiwan's upcoming municipal elections.

President Donald Trump disclosed on February 17-18 that he is actively discussing the question of future US arms sales to Taiwan with Chinese President Xi Jinping, confirming that a decision will be made "soon" on a sensitive issue that carries enormous implications for Taiwan's security and US-China relations. The disclosure came as both governments prepare for a highly anticipated Trump-Xi bilateral summit in April, with arms sales to Taiwan representing one of the most contentious outstanding points in the relationship. Trump's direct engagement with Xi on the issue represents a departure from the traditional US approach of treating Taiwan arms sales as a bilateral US-Taiwan matter separate from US-China dialogue.

On the legislative front, the US House of Representatives passed the PROTECT Taiwan Act on February 9, which stipulates that Washington will seek to exclude the People's Republic of China from international financial institutions if Beijing "threatens Taiwan's security, economic system, or social system" and US interests. Separately, on February 12, the US and Taiwan signed the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade, committing Taiwan to purchasing $44.4 billion in US liquefied natural gas and crude oil, $25.2 billion in power and grid equipment, and $15.2 billion in civilian aircraft through 2029 — a package designed to deepen economic interdependence that Beijing will interpret as further institutionalization of US-Taiwan ties.

Beijing held its annual Taiwan Work Conference from February 9-10, where top CCP officials from Taiwan policy agencies formulated Beijing's comprehensive 2026 approach to Taiwan around four core priorities: uniting pro-Beijing forces within Taiwan while preventing US arms deliveries; promoting integration of PRC-Taiwanese supply chains to undermine US-Taiwan economic links; strengthening the legal basis for unification while punishing supporters of Taiwan independence; and establishing a special task force using United Front influence operations and cyberspace attacks to damage the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan's upcoming municipal elections. Chinese military aircraft incursions around Taiwan have surged nearly 15-fold over the past five years, with one December 2025 episode involving over 100 Chinese aircraft operating around the island in a single day.

### 7. US Moves to Control Venezuela's Oil Sector After Maduro Capture; Trump Plans Visit
*Feb 18*

> Following the January 3 US military capture of President Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration in February authorized five major oil companies — BP, Chevron, Eni, Repsol, and Shell — to operate in Venezuela with revenues directed to US Treasury-controlled accounts, effectively placing Washington in administrative control of Venezuela's oil sector, as Trump announced plans for a personal visit to Caracas with no date set.

The Trump administration took a significant step in formalizing US control over Venezuela's petroleum sector by issuing Treasury Department general licenses in February authorizing five major international oil companies — BP, Chevron, Eni, Repsol, and Shell — to conduct operations in Venezuela's oil and gas sector, clearing away sanctions that had previously blocked industry investment. The licenses require that royalty payments be directed to accounts designated by the US Treasury Department, consistent with Trump administration statements that Washington will manage Venezuelan oil assets "in custody for the benefit of Venezuela." Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been explicit in characterizing Washington as effectively controlling Venezuela's oil resources for the foreseeable future following Maduro's capture.

The legal and political architecture being constructed represents an unprecedented assertion of US economic suzerainty over a sovereign nation's primary national resource. Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, and the Maduro government had deepened oil ties with China and Russia during years of US sanctions, with both nations now facing displacement from arrangements that had given them preferential access to Venezuelan petroleum exports. Trump has framed US control of Venezuelan oil as both a counternarcotics measure — Maduro faces narco-terrorism charges in New York after his January 3 capture — and an economic opportunity for American companies to revive access to a long-inaccessible oil market.

Trump also announced plans to personally visit Venezuela, though no date has been set, marking what would be the first direct presidential visit to a country where the US military captured the sitting head of state. The domestic political situation inside Venezuela remains volatile, with pro-Maduro networks, military factions of unclear loyalty, and the opposition led by Edmundo González navigating a post-Maduro transition that Washington is attempting to shape. The intervention has drawn sharp criticism from Latin American governments including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Cuba, while China and Russia have condemned what they characterize as a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty and international law.

### 8. Trump-Japan Energy and Critical Minerals Partnership Launches Three Major Projects
*Feb 18*

> President Trump announced on February 18 that the United States has launched three massive joint projects with Japan covering oil and gas production, power generation, and critical minerals extraction, deepening the US-Japan economic partnership and representing a significant push to secure US energy and supply chain interests in collaboration with Tokyo ahead of anticipated Indo-Pacific tensions.

President Trump announced on Tuesday, February 18, that the United States and Japan have launched three major joint projects covering oil and gas production, power generation, and critical minerals extraction, in a deepening of the bilateral economic partnership that administration officials framed as both a commercial and strategic initiative. The energy and critical minerals partnership comes as Japan under Prime Minister Takaichi pursues an assertive foreign policy and defense buildup following her landslide election victory, and as both Washington and Tokyo seek to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains for materials essential to defense manufacturing, battery production, and semiconductor fabrication.

The critical minerals component of the partnership directly addresses growing concern in both capitals about China's dominance over rare earth processing and extraction. China controls approximately 85% of global rare earth refining capacity, a concentration of supply chain power that both governments view as a strategic vulnerability following the emergence of US-China technological competition and Beijing's previous use of rare earth export restrictions as economic leverage. The joint US-Japan critical minerals projects will focus on diversifying supply chains through exploration, extraction, and processing investments in friendly jurisdictions outside Chinese control.

The energy production partnership builds on Japan's existing role as one of the world's largest buyers of American liquefied natural gas, and the power generation component is expected to include cooperation on advanced reactor technology and next-generation energy infrastructure. The announcements were welcomed by Japanese industry groups and come as Takaichi's government navigates the challenge of meeting Trump's demand that Japan raise defense spending to NATO-standard levels — a fiscal expansion that requires robust economic growth — while simultaneously managing the relationship with China, Japan's largest trading partner. The joint projects underscore the solidifying character of the US-Japan alliance as a pillar of Indo-Pacific security architecture.

### 9. Iran Uprising Deepens as Nationwide Protests Challenge Clerical Regime Amid Nuclear Talks
*Feb 18*

> An uprising that erupted across Iran on December 28, 2025, has transformed from shopkeeper protests over the collapsing rial into a nationwide political movement challenging the clerical regime, with the National Council of Resistance of Iran reporting continued unrest across major cities as nuclear negotiations proceed in Geneva — creating an unprecedented situation in which the regime faces simultaneous external diplomatic pressure and internal political challenge.

An uprising that began in Iran on December 28, 2025, initially triggered by shopkeepers shuttering stores over the collapse of the Iranian rial, has undergone a profound transformation into a nationwide political movement openly challenging the authority of the clerical regime, according to the National Council of Resistance of Iran and multiple reports from within the country. The protests have spread from bazaars and commercial districts to universities, factories, and residential neighborhoods across major Iranian cities, with demonstrators increasingly voicing slogans that question not merely economic mismanagement but the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic's governing structure itself.

The uprising poses a deeply complicated challenge for the regime's negotiating posture in Geneva. Iranian officials led by Foreign Minister Araghchi have been attempting to project an image of state authority and diplomatic purposefulness at the nuclear talks, while simultaneously confronting internal disorder that the regime has struggled to suppress without triggering international condemnation that could complicate the diplomatic process it is currently pursuing. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has deployed significant security forces, and the regime has imposed internet restrictions and communication blackouts in affected cities, a familiar playbook from the 2019 fuel protests and the 2022 Mahsa Amini uprising.

International human rights organizations have documented arrests of protest organizers, journalists, and civic leaders since December, while the Iranian diaspora — including members of the Pahlavi opposition network — has called for expanded international support for the protest movement. The simultaneity of the nuclear talks and the domestic uprising creates extraordinary complexity: a deal that provides the regime with sanctions relief could strengthen it domestically at the precise moment when internal pressure has reached unusual intensity, a dynamic that critics of the diplomatic track argue Western negotiators are insufficiently weighing in their assessment of the talks' strategic implications.

### 10. Ramadan 2026 Begins February 18 as Muslim World Marks Holy Month Amid Gaza Conflict
*Feb 18*

> The Islamic holy month of Ramadan 2026 officially began on February 18, confirmed by Qatar, the UAE, and other Gulf states following moon sighting, marking the start of a period of profound spiritual significance for 1.9 billion Muslims worldwide that coincides with an active Gaza conflict, Iran nuclear negotiations, and multiple regional crises — with humanitarian organizations warning that Ramadan will deepen food insecurity in conflict zones where aid access is already severely restricted.

Qatar's Crescent Sighting Committee of the Ministry of Endowments confirmed on February 18 that Wednesday marks the first day of the blessed month of Ramadan 2026, with the UAE making a simultaneous official announcement. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and the majority of Muslim-majority states followed with corresponding confirmations, beginning a month-long period of fasting, prayer, and intensified charitable giving observed by approximately 1.9 billion Muslims across more than 50 countries. The timing of Ramadan's beginning was astronomically contested this year, with some Islamic scholars and national authorities noting that naked-eye moon sighting conditions were particularly ambiguous in specific geographic regions.

The commencement of Ramadan carries heightened significance given the political and humanitarian crises unfolding across the Muslim world. In Gaza, the start of Ramadan coincides with a ceasefire that has failed to stop Israeli strikes, a humanitarian aid blockade that has delivered less than half the agreed volume of food and medicine to 2.1 million people, and a political process in which Hamas has rejected disarmament demands while an Israeli minister has issued a 60-day ultimatum threatening renewed full-scale war. Humanitarian organizations including UNRWA and the World Food Programme have warned that Ramadan will deepen food insecurity across the territory as fasting intersects with critical shortages of basic goods.

Across Iran, Ramadan begins as the country navigates both nuclear diplomacy in Geneva and an internal uprising that has challenged the clerical regime since late December 2025. In Sudan, where the Rapid Support Forces and Sudan Armed Forces have been fighting a devastating civil war since April 2023, Ramadan will coincide with what the UN has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with millions at risk of famine in Darfur and Kordofan. The month's traditional emphasis on charity, community, and reflection stands in sharp contrast to the scale of violence and deprivation afflicting Muslim communities in multiple conflict zones simultaneously.

### 1. S&P 500 Rises 0.4% as AI Jitters Ease; FOMC Minutes and Economic Data in Focus
*Feb 18*

> US stock index futures climbed on Wednesday morning as sentiment stabilized following recent AI-driven volatility, with the S&P 500 rising 0.4% to 6,869 and financials outperforming after Fed Governor Michael Barr's comments on rates, as markets awaited the release of the Federal Reserve's January 27-28 FOMC meeting minutes and December housing starts and building permits data.

US equity markets opened Wednesday on firmer footing as investor sentiment recovered from the AI-disruption-driven volatility that dominated the prior week's trading sessions, with the S&P 500 (SPX) rising approximately 0.4% to 6,869 points, the Nasdaq Composite climbing 0.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.5%. Stock index futures had edged higher in premarket trading alongside gains in Asian markets, reflecting a "dip-buying" mentality after recent sharp sector rotations. Apple led the session's top gainers at +3.2%, while American Express and JPMorgan also posted strong performances. Walmart fell 3.9% as the market's largest pre-earnings seller ahead of its Q4 FY26 results due before the bell on February 19.

Financials outperformed the broader market, with JPMorgan up 1.5% and Citigroup up 2.7%, following comments from Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr signaling that interest rates may need to remain restrictive for an extended period — language that bolstered bank net interest margin expectations. Markets also prepared for the day's main institutional event: the release of the Federal Reserve's official minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC meeting, at which the Committee voted to maintain rates at the 3.5%–3.75% target range, with two dissenting officials preferring a quarter-point cut. Charles Schwab's chief fixed income strategist Kathy Jones told media that "the case for rate cuts is not going to present itself until mid-year at best and maybe not at all this year."

The morning also brought December residential construction data from the Census Bureau — a delayed release originally scheduled for earlier months — showing December housing starts at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,404,000, up 6.2% from November's revised 1,322,000 but down 7.3% from December 2024's 1,514,000. The data painted a mixed picture for the housing sector, with single-family starts showing modest recovery while multi-family construction declined. Kevin Warsh's nomination by Trump as the next Federal Reserve Chair — to succeed Jerome Powell when his term expires in May — was also drawing market attention, with investors analyzing Warsh's track record for signals about the future direction of monetary policy.

### 2. Palo Alto Networks Beats Q2 Estimates But Shares Fall 7% on Weak Forward Guidance
*Feb 18*

> Palo Alto Networks reported fiscal Q2 2026 revenue of $2.59 billion — up 15% year-over-year and above the $2.58 billion consensus — with adjusted EPS of $1.03 beating the $0.94 estimate, but shares fell 7% after the company's Q3 earnings guidance of $0.78–$0.80 per share came in dramatically below analysts' $0.92 expectation, despite the company's announcement of two major acquisitions including the $25 billion purchase of CyberArk.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reported fiscal second quarter 2026 results after the bell on February 17, beating Wall Street's revenue and earnings estimates but falling sharply in after-hours trading on disappointing forward guidance. Revenue for the quarter reached $2.59 billion, up 15% from $2.3 billion a year earlier and marginally above the $2.58 billion analyst consensus. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 topped the $0.94 estimate, and GAAP net income for the quarter was $432 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Next-Generation Security annual recurring revenue climbed 33% year-over-year to $6.33 billion, including a $200 million contribution from the recently completed Chronosphere acquisition, while remaining performance obligations grew 23% to $16 billion — metrics reflecting the sustained strength of Palo Alto's platform consolidation strategy.

The market's negative reaction centered on the company's fiscal Q3 2026 guidance, which called for adjusted EPS of $0.78–$0.80 per share, dramatically below analysts' consensus estimate of $0.92. The company also lowered its full-year adjusted earnings guidance range from $3.80–$3.90 to $3.65–$3.70 per share, a downward revision that analysts attributed to the dilutive short-term impact of major recent acquisitions. Palo Alto closed its $25 billion acquisition of identity security platform CyberArk in February and completed the more than $3 billion purchase of cloud observability platform Chronosphere in January, bringing total acquisition spending to approximately $28 billion — investments the company is framing as the foundation for an AI-native cybersecurity platform.

CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized the strategic rationale for the acquisition-driven growth model on the earnings call, arguing that Palo Alto's "platformization" approach — consolidating customers onto a single integrated security architecture rather than point solutions — positions the company uniquely in a market where AI-driven threats are accelerating the obsolescence of fragmented security tools. Despite the guidance miss, the company raised its full-year revenue forecast to $11.28–$11.31 billion from prior guidance of $10.50–$10.54 billion, a significant upward revision driven by the additional revenue from CyberArk. The stock's 7% decline reflected market frustration that near-term earnings power has been sacrificed for longer-term strategic positioning.

### 3. Walmart Set to Report Q4 FY26 Earnings February 19 as "Make-or-Break" Consumer Read
*Feb 18*

> Analysts entered February 18 pricing Walmart's Q4 FY26 earnings — due before the bell on February 19 — as the single most important consumer spending bellwether of the first quarter, with consensus expecting adjusted EPS of $0.73 (nearly 10% year-over-year growth) and revenue of $188–190 billion, as Walmart's shift to higher-income shoppers, e-commerce profitability, and AI-driven automation has propelled its stock to a $1 trillion market capitalization milestone.

Walmart (WMT) is scheduled to release its fourth quarter fiscal year 2026 results before the opening bell on February 19 at 6 a.m. CST, with a live investor conference call at 7 a.m. CST. Analyst consensus entering the reporting date called for adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 — representing nearly 10% year-over-year growth from the $0.66 per share reported in the same quarter last year — and total revenue in the range of $188.6 to $190.5 billion, which would represent approximately 6% year-over-year growth. US comparable sales excluding fuel are expected to show approximately 4.1% growth, driven largely by a 4.1% surge in foot traffic observed throughout January 2026, a period that includes the post-holiday shopping normalization and the beginning of spring merchandise transitions.

The earnings report carries heightened significance as a read on the American consumer amid tariff concerns, government spending cuts under the DOGE initiative, and elevated prices across discretionary categories. Analysts note that approximately 75% of Walmart's recent market share gains have come from households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000 — a striking demographic shift for a retailer historically associated with value-seeking lower-income shoppers, indicating that premium consumers are trading down to Walmart from traditional grocery and general merchandise rivals. This trading-down dynamic has been a consistent feature of Walmart's performance since 2023 and continues to reshape competitive dynamics across the retail sector.

Walmart's structural evolution under CEO Doug McMillon has materially improved the company's margin profile. The e-commerce division reached profitability for the first time in 2025, with advertising arm Walmart Connect growing at more than 30% annually and high-margin data and media revenue increasingly contributing to the bottom line. The company has automated 60% of its store freight handling through advanced distribution centers, driving operational efficiency beyond what traditional store expansion could achieve. Walmart crossed the $1 trillion market capitalization threshold in 2025 and moved its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq in December, positioning the company as a technology-driven retailer rather than purely a brick-and-mortar operator.

### 4. Oil Surges 2.6% to $64 as US-Iran War Risk Spikes; Technical Analysts See Downside Risk
*Feb 18*

> WTI crude oil jumped 2.6% to approximately $64 per barrel on February 18 as reporting emerged that a White House official placed the probability of a US-Israel joint military strike on Iran within weeks at 90%, a potential supply disruption catalyst that overwhelmed bearish signals from ongoing US-Iran nuclear diplomacy in Geneva and the EIA's standing forecast of a Brent crude average of $58 per barrel for 2026.

WTI crude oil prices surged approximately 2.6% to around $64 per barrel on Wednesday as geopolitical risk premium re-entered energy markets following alarming reports that a White House official placed the probability of a joint US-Israel military strike on Iran "within weeks" at 90%, with Israeli officials reportedly preparing for conflict "within days." The potential for military action against Iran — which controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which approximately 20% of global petroleum consumption passes — represents a profound supply disruption risk that overwhelmed the simultaneous bearish signals from ongoing US-Iran nuclear diplomacy in Geneva and forecasts of global oil market oversupply through the year. European markets closed with the dollar steady but oil well bid, with traders repositioning for a conflict scenario.

The oil market has been under sustained structural downward pressure ahead of the day's spike. The US Energy Information Administration's February 2026 Short-Term Energy Outlook forecast Brent crude averaging just $58 per barrel for the full year 2026, reflecting expectations of oversupply from non-OPEC producers, weakening Chinese demand growth, and the gradual reopening of Iranian oil supply under a potential nuclear settlement. Technical analysis entering February 18 had pointed to potential downside targets in the $59–60 range after prices broke below key support levels at $62–63 per barrel, making the day's 2.6% surge a sharp reversal of the established short-term trend.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps recently concluded its "Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz" naval exercises, which included temporary closure of sections of the strategic chokepoint as a warning to Washington ahead of the Geneva nuclear talks. The IRGC exercises and Supreme Leader Khamenei's public warning that Iran can sink a US warship underscored the escalatory potential of the current moment, with two American aircraft carriers — the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Gerald R. Ford — already deployed to the Gulf region. Energy traders are now pricing significant conflict risk premium into crude futures while simultaneously monitoring the Geneva diplomatic track, creating a market environment defined by exceptional uncertainty across the full spectrum of outcomes from deal to war.

### 5. Warner Bros. Discovery Reopens Paramount Talks; Netflix Grants Limited Waiver Through February 23
*Feb 18*

> Warner Bros. Discovery announced Tuesday it has reopened a one-week window of deal discussions with Paramount Skydance following Netflix's grant of a limited waiver allowing WBD to hear Paramount's "best and final" $31-per-share offer — a development that sets up a climactic media consolidation showdown before a March 20 shareholder vote on the existing Netflix merger, in what would be among the largest media transactions in history.

Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced on February 17 that it is reopening deal discussions with Paramount Skydance after Netflix granted a limited waiver under the terms of WBD's existing merger agreement with the streaming giant, permitting WBD to engage with Paramount Skydance for a seven-day window ending February 23, 2026. The development sets up a dramatic climax to one of the most complex media consolidation sagas in decades: WBD agreed in December to sell most of itself — including the Warner Bros. movie studio, HBO, and its streaming assets — to Netflix, while cable channels including CNN were excluded from that deal. Paramount CEO David Ellison responded by going directly to WBD shareholders with a competing all-cash offer of $30 per share for the entire company including CNN, later sweetened to $31 per share in a revised proposal delivered February 10.

Paramount's sweetened February offer added significant inducements: a promise to cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee WBD would owe Netflix if it abandoned the streaming deal, a commitment to backstop a refinancing that would cut WBD's debt costs by $1.5 billion, and a "ticking fee" of $650 million per quarter in cash if the Paramount-WBD deal is not completed by end of 2026 — provisions designed to make the Paramount offer economically compelling enough to justify abandoning the Netflix transaction. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos responded with characteristic confidence, telling media "let them make a move," while confirming Netflix's merger agreement with WBD remains the company's preferred outcome.

WBD announced it will hold a special shareholder meeting on March 20 at which it will recommend voting to approve the Netflix deal, meaning the one-week Paramount window running through February 23 is a genuine opportunity for Paramount to make a case to the WBD board that its offer materially exceeds the Netflix deal's value to shareholders. The outcome will help determine whether Hollywood's most coveted content library — including Warner Bros.' DC Comics franchise, Harry Potter, and HBO's prestige television catalog — combines with Netflix's distribution platform or becomes part of a reconstituted old-media giant under Ellison's Paramount umbrella. The combined WBD-Netflix entity would be valued at approximately $100 billion including debt, while a WBD-Paramount combination would create an $80 billion company.

### 6. Sumitomo Forestry to Acquire Tri Pointe Homes for $4.5 Billion, Becoming 5th-Largest US Homebuilder
*Feb 18*

> Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Forestry announced a definitive agreement on February 13 to acquire Irvine-based Tri Pointe Homes for $47 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion — a 29% premium to Tri Pointe's prior closing price — that would make Sumitomo the fifth-largest US homebuilder by closings with more than 18,000 units annually, in a major cross-border bet on the structural US housing shortage.

Sumitomo Forestry, one of Japan's largest residential construction and real estate conglomerates, announced a definitive agreement on February 13 to acquire Irvine, California-based Tri Pointe Homes for $47.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion, representing a 29% premium to Tri Pointe's closing stock price on February 12, 2026, and a 42% premium to the company's 90-day volume weighted average price. The deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026 subject to Tri Pointe shareholder approval and customary regulatory conditions, would make Sumitomo the fifth-largest US homebuilder by annual closings — combining its existing US group operations with Tri Pointe's more than 150 active communities across 13 high-growth states to produce roughly 18,000 units per year.

Tri Pointe brings a premium homebuilding brand with 17 active divisions and significant presence in high-demand Sun Belt markets including California, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and the Carolinas, areas experiencing the strongest population growth and housing supply constraints in the country. Sumitomo will maintain Tri Pointe as a distinct brand led by its existing management team under CEO Doug Bauer, preserving the company's operational identity and relationships with land sellers, municipal permitting authorities, and subcontractor networks that are critical to homebuilding execution. Sumitomo Forestry's US strategy has been steadily expanding through a series of acquisitions of regional homebuilders over the past decade as Japanese investors have sought exposure to the structural American housing shortage.

The transaction reflects both the persistent US housing deficit — estimated at 3.5 to 7 million units below long-term demographic demand — and the growing appeal of the US homebuilding sector to sophisticated foreign capital seeking inflation-resistant real assets with durable demand. Sumitomo's $4.5 billion all-cash bid comes at a moment when US homebuilder stocks have experienced significant volatility due to elevated mortgage rates, tariff uncertainty affecting construction materials costs, and slower than expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. The deal's announcement on February 13 sent Tri Pointe shares surging toward the $47 offer price, and analysts at Nikkei Asia noted the acquisition would make Sumitomo a formidable player in the American residential market for the long term.

### 7. Bitcoin Retreats to $67,400 Amid Continued ETF Outflows; Market Searches for Bottom
*Feb 18*

> Bitcoin declined 1.85% to approximately $67,400 on February 18 as spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded continued outflows totaling more than $6 billion over four months since October 2025's all-time high of $126,198, with technical analysts identifying key support in the $64,000–$68,000 range and a potential recovery to $72,000 by March contingent on reclaiming the 200-day exponential moving average.

Bitcoin (BTC) traded at approximately $67,400 on February 18, 2026, down 1.85% over the prior 24 hours, continuing a protracted retracement from the cryptocurrency's all-time high of approximately $126,198 reached in October 2025 — a decline of roughly 46% from peak that has erased trillions of dollars in aggregate crypto market capitalization since the historic October rally. The price action on February 18 reflected broader caution in digital asset markets, with Ethereum and major altcoins also trading in negative territory as institutional appetite for risk assets showed continued restraint. Bitcoin's market capitalization stood at approximately $1.36 trillion.

The weakness has been amplified by sustained outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which have shed more than $6 billion in aggregate over the four months since October's peak, reversing the historic inflows that characterized the period immediately following ETF launches in January 2024. Veteran analyst commentary published February 18 warned that the "buy-the-dip" mentality that has driven crypto markets since 2008 may be facing a structural test, as the post-halving supply dynamics and cooling institutional momentum create conditions distinct from previous crypto cycles. Futures open interest has declined alongside spot prices, indicating reduced speculative positioning rather than a market preparing for a leveraged upswing.

Technical analysts examining BTC/USD on February 18 identified the current trading range of $64,000–$75,000 as the zone where the market is searching for a definitive bottom, with the $68,000 level serving as the critical threshold that must be regained before the 200-day exponential moving average can be reclaimed. A price prediction consensus pointed toward potential recovery toward $72,000 by March 2026 if key resistance levels are broken, but also identified $59,000–$60,000 as a realistic downside target if current support around $64,000 fails. The consolidation phase comes as regulatory engagement intensifies globally, with ETHDenver 2026 drawing SEC officials in an unusual demonstration of collaborative rather than enforcement-driven regulatory posture toward the crypto industry.

### 8. FOMC Minutes from January Meeting Expected to Confirm Hawkish Pause Amid Economic Uncertainty
*Feb 18*

> The Federal Reserve's official minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC meeting were scheduled for release on February 18, with markets expecting the document to confirm a hawkish pause in rate cuts reflecting solid economic growth, labor market stability, and elevated inflation risks — with two dissenting officials having preferred a quarter-point cut and the Fed holding rates at 3.5%–3.75%.

The Federal Reserve's official minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC meeting were scheduled for release on February 18, with economists and market participants preparing to analyze the document for signals about the pace of potential future rate cuts amid an economic environment characterized by solid growth, persistent inflation concerns, and elevated uncertainty about the impact of Trump's tariff agenda. The Committee voted at the January meeting to maintain the federal funds rate target range at 3.5%–3.75%, pausing the easing cycle that had produced three consecutive cuts in the prior year — with two dissenting voting members preferring a quarter-point cut reflecting concerns that the economic deceleration is more pronounced than the majority acknowledged.

The January meeting statement acknowledged that "economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, job gains have remained low with the unemployment rate showing some signs of stabilization, and inflation remains somewhat elevated." Markets and Fed-watchers will parse the minutes for detail on how extensively the Committee discussed the tariff risk, with Trump's import taxes now at their highest weighted average level since 1946 and producer price data showing businesses beginning to pass tariff costs to consumers. The degree to which individual FOMC members viewed tariffs as a temporary shock versus a persistent inflation factor will provide important guidance on the Fed's likely response function.

Senior Fed officials have provided mixed signals in the weeks since the January meeting. Fed Governor Michael Barr's comments on February 18 that rates "may need to remain restrictive for some time" sent bank stocks higher by reinforcing net interest margin expectations, while other officials have suggested the Committee remains genuinely data-dependent and could resume cuts as early as mid-year if economic softening accelerates. Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair — announced this week — adds a political dimension to the rate outlook, as Warsh's track record suggests a somewhat more hawkish approach than the Powell Fed and his confirmation hearings will inevitably feature intense scrutiny of his monetary policy views.

### 9. Gold Pulls Back to $4,950–4,968 as Profit-Taking Follows Historic January Rally to $5,595 Record
*Feb 18*

> Gold traded between $4,918 and $4,968 per ounce on February 18, representing a correction of roughly 10–12% from the January 29 all-time high of $5,595.42 that was driven by safe-haven demand, dollar weakness, and rate cut expectations — with analysts from Goldman Sachs maintaining a 2026 target of $5,400 as geopolitical tensions including the Iran war risk premium provided partial support against profit-taking.

Gold (XAU/USD) traded in a range of approximately $4,918 to $4,968 per ounce on February 18, 2026, representing a correction of roughly 10–12% from the precious metal's January 29, 2026 all-time high of $5,595.42 — a record that marked the culmination of a rally of more than 25% since early 2025 driven by safe-haven demand, US dollar weakness, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The pull back from January's peak reflects a combination of profit-taking by institutional investors who built large positions during the rally, some recovery in the US dollar from its recent lows (the dollar index touched 96.88 in mid-February, its weakest 12-month performance since 2017), and reduced immediate urgency of safe-haven purchases as the Geneva diplomatic process temporarily eased the most acute fears of US-Iran conflict.

The partial support on February 18 from the oil market's 2.6% surge — driven by reports of an imminent US-Israel military strike on Iran — provided a floor for gold as traditional safe-haven flows reinforced physical demand. Iran conflict risk creates a natural positive correlation between oil and gold as investors simultaneously price energy supply disruption and geopolitical uncertainty. Goldman Sachs maintained its 2026 gold price target of $5,400 per ounce through its latest research note, citing persistent central bank buying from emerging market central banks diversifying reserves away from US Treasuries, sustained ETF inflows, and the likelihood of at least one additional Fed rate cut before year-end as the fundamental drivers supporting the thesis.

The gold market's dynamics in February 2026 reflect a broader recalibration of safe-haven allocation across institutional portfolios globally. Central banks from China, India, Turkey, Poland, and multiple Gulf states have continued accumulating physical gold as a reserve asset diversification strategy, with the World Gold Council estimating official sector demand reached a near-record in 2025. Saudi Arabia's expansion of yuan-denominated oil settlement has coincided with its central bank adding gold reserves, reflecting a deliberate strategy of reducing dollar-denominated reserve exposure. The combination of persistent geopolitical uncertainty, a structurally weakened dollar, and rising US government debt — which the Congressional Budget Office projected will reach 120% of GDP by 2036 — continues to underpin the long-term gold bull case.

### 10. German Coalition Negotiations Advance as CDU/CSU-SPD Grand Coalition Appears Likely Outcome
*Feb 18*

> Three weeks after Germany's February 23, 2025 federal election — in which the CDU won but fell short of 30%, AfD came second with 25%, and SPD trailed at 14% — exploratory talks between Friedrich Merz's CDU/CSU and the SPD were advancing toward a formal grand coalition agreement, with economic reform the central priority as Germany faces its worst growth performance among major eurozone economies, expected to expand just 0.8% in 2026.

Coalition negotiations following Germany's February 23, 2025 federal election continued to advance in February 2026, with CDU/CSU leader Friedrich Merz's center-right alliance and the center-left SPD progressing toward a formal grand coalition agreement after exploratory talks began in late February 2025. The CDU/CSU emerged as the largest party in the election with approximately 29% of the vote — falling below the 30% mark that would have provided a stronger mandate — while the AfD came a historically close second at approximately 25%, the SPD placed third at 14%, the Greens at approximately 13%, and the Left Party at around 8.5%, producing a Bundestag configuration that made a CDU/CSU-SPD coalition the only mathematically viable centrist government. The AfD was excluded from coalition consideration by the other parties' continued adherence to the Brandmauer principle.

The grand coalition negotiations have centered on Germany's acute economic challenges: the German economy has not grown since the COVID-19 pandemic, and its performance is the worst among the euro area's major economies by several metrics. The three most pressing structural issues are energy costs — dramatically elevated since Russia's invasion of Ukraine ended decades of cheap Russian gas dependency — the changing role of China as both Germany's largest trading partner and a rising industrial competitor, and a decade of underinvestment in infrastructure, digitalization, and military capacity that has left the economy with a productivity gap relative to peer nations. Deutsche Bank and ING both project Germany will return only to sluggish growth of approximately 0.7–0.8% in 2026 even under optimistic policy scenarios.

The new government's economic reform agenda — including potential amendments to the constitutional debt brake to enable investment in defense and infrastructure, corporate tax reforms to improve competitiveness, and energy policy adjustments to bring industrial electricity costs closer to international norms — will have significant implications for the broader eurozone economy and European Union cohesion. Germany's political and economic trajectory is closely watched by European institutions and trading partners, with the new Merz government expected to take a more assertive German role in EU economic governance than the preceding Scholz-led coalition while maintaining strong support for Ukraine and the European security architecture. Investment Week estimated the economic impact of the election outcome would not be fully felt until late 2026 as government negotiations and legislative processes conclude.
