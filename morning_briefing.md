### 1. UK Blocks US Access to RAF Bases for Potential Iran Strike Over International Law Concerns
*Feb 21*

> British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has blocked a request from US President Donald Trump to use UK air bases including Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford during any preemptive attack on Iran, citing concerns that such operations would breach international law, as the White House draws up detailed military plans involving long-range bombers and Trump warns the world will find out "over the next 10 days" whether military action or a diplomatic deal emerges.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has blocked a request from US President Donald Trump to allow US forces to use UK air bases during any preemptive attack on Iran, owing to concerns it would be in breach of international law. Both Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean, and RAF Fairford, a base in Gloucestershire, would be important to any American plans to use long-range bombers in a sustained campaign against Iran. Under prevailing legal interpretations, there is no distinction between the state carrying out a strike and a state that supports it if the latter was aware of the circumstances of an unlawful act, and a strike on Iran would likely not align with Britain's interpretation of international law.

The dispute has created friction between Trump and Starmer, particularly regarding the Diego Garcia lease deal. Trump pulled his support for Starmer's lease deal after the U.K. refused to allow its bases to be used to strike Iran, reversing course and saying in a Truth Social post that Starmer is "making a big mistake" in agreeing to the lease deal with Mauritius. The denial of base access represents a significant constraint on US military planning, as Diego Garcia's strategic location in the Indian Ocean makes it an ideal staging point for bomber operations targeting Iran's nuclear facilities and military infrastructure, while RAF Fairford routinely hosts US B-52 and B-2 bombers during European deployments.

President Trump announced that the US is planning for "weeks of large-scale warfare" against Iran starting Saturday, with officials telling reporters that military preparations are underway. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted military exercises near the Strait of Hormuz on Monday, February 17, while the United States has positioned multiple carrier strike groups in the region. Norway relocated approximately 60 military personnel from Iraq and other parts of the Middle East on February 20, citing security concerns amid heightened tensions. The escalating crisis comes as US-Iran nuclear talks have shown limited progress, with Trump issuing a 10-day ultimatum for a diplomatic breakthrough before considering military options.

### 2. Trump Announces China Visit March 31-April 2 Following Supreme Court Tariff Ruling
*Feb 21*

> President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping, the White House announced on February 21, marking Trump's first visit to China since 2017 and coming just one day after the Supreme Court struck down key tariffs central to his trade strategy, as the three-day trip at Beijing's invitation will focus on extending a trade truce reached in October that paused further tariff escalation.

President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to a White House announcement made on February 21. The three-day trip, at Beijing's invitation, comes more than eight years after Trump's first visit to China during his initial term as president. The timing is significant as the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key tariffs central to his trade strategy on Friday, February 20, shortly before the White House confirmed the trip. The Beijing talks are expected to focus on extending a trade truce reached in October 2025 that paused further tariff escalation between the world's two largest economies.

Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have respectively described "excellent" and "good communication" between the two countries in recent months, suggesting that diplomatic channels remain open despite persistent tensions over trade, technology, Taiwan, and regional security issues. The visit represents Trump's most significant engagement with China since returning to office, and comes as both countries navigate complex economic relationships including Chinese purchases of US agricultural products, technology restrictions, and competing visions for Indo-Pacific security architecture. The scheduled visit follows several high-level exchanges between US and Chinese officials throughout early 2026, including discussions on nuclear talks, regional stability, and economic cooperation.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced he will travel to China next week to discuss cooperation, stating that U.S. tariff policy is not Europe's approach — a signal that European powers are pursuing independent engagement with Beijing even as Washington maintains a more confrontational posture. China's trade surplus rose 20 percent to $1.2 trillion in 2025 as industrial overcapacity drove exports, creating tensions with trading partners who argue that Chinese manufacturing subsidies distort global markets. Trump's visit will test whether the two sides can establish a more stable framework for managing economic competition, or whether fundamental disagreements over trade practices, human rights, and Taiwan will continue to drive bilateral tensions throughout 2026.

### 3. Iran Demands Evidence After Trump and UN Experts Highlight January Protest Killings
*Feb 21*

> The Iranian government blamed "terrorists" for the killings of thousands during nationwide protests last month, demanding evidence after US President Trump and UN human rights experts raised concerns, as Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the government released a list of 3,117 people described as "victims of recent terrorist operation" including about 200 security personnel, while international observers document systematic violence against demonstrators across multiple Iranian cities.

The Iranian government has blamed "terrorists" for the killings of thousands during nationwide protests in January 2026, after US President Trump and UN human rights experts raised concerns about the regime's violent crackdown on dissent. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the government released a list of 3,117 people described as "victims of recent terrorist operation," including about 200 security personnel, in an apparent attempt to deflect responsibility for the death toll and frame the protests as a security crisis rather than popular uprising. The Iranian narrative contrasts sharply with accounts from international human rights organizations, which have documented systematic use of live ammunition against peaceful protesters, mass arrests, and enforced disappearances.

UN human rights experts and international observers have compiled evidence showing that Iranian security forces used lethal force against demonstrators during the January protests, which erupted across multiple cities in response to economic hardship, political repression, and anger over the regime's handling of various domestic and foreign policy issues. Video footage and witness testimony document security forces firing directly into crowds, beating protesters, and conducting nighttime raids on residential areas to arrest suspected organizers. The scale of the violence represents one of the most severe crackdowns on dissent in Iran since the 2019 protests, which killed an estimated 1,500 people according to Reuters reporting at the time.

President Trump has made Iran's human rights record a focal point of his administration's Middle East policy, using the January killings to justify his hardline stance and build international pressure on Tehran. The Trump administration has called for independent investigations into the protest deaths and threatened additional sanctions targeting Iranian officials responsible for human rights abuses. Iran's insistence that "terrorists" were responsible for the violence and its demand for evidence from accusers represents a standard regime tactic of deflecting blame and avoiding accountability for state-sanctioned repression, while the release of a list including security personnel deaths appears designed to bolster the narrative that Iran faced a coordinated insurgency rather than popular protests.

### 4. UN Report Finds "Hallmarks of Genocide" in Sudan's El Fasher as RSF Kills 6,000
*Feb 21*

> The Rapid Support Forces carried out ethnically targeted killings, widespread sexual violence and enforced disappearances during their late-October takeover of El Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region, with a UN fact-finding mission stating the evidence shows "hallmarks of genocide" against the Zaghawa and Fur communities as at least 6,000 people were killed between October 25-27, 2025, prompting US Treasury sanctions on three RSF commanders.

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out ethnically targeted killings, widespread sexual violence and enforced disappearances during their late-October takeover of El Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region — acts that a UN fact-finding mission said show "hallmarks of genocide" against the Zaghawa and Fur communities. The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan said the evidence establishes that at least three underlying acts of genocide were committed: killing members of a protected ethnic group; causing serious bodily and mental harm; and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction in whole or in part.

The findings focus on events in and around El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, during the RSF takeover in late October 2025, after what the mission described as an 18-month siege that progressively cut off civilians from food, water, medical supplies and humanitarian assistance. The report said the siege "systematically weakened the targeted population through starvation, deprivation, trauma and confinement," leaving many unable to flee when the assault came. More than 6,000 people were killed between October 25 and October 27 in the city, according to reports, with thousands of persons, particularly the Zaghawa, killed, raped or disappeared during three days of absolute horror.

After publication of the report, the United States Department of the Treasury announced it was imposing sanctions on three RSF commanders, accusing the group of perpetrating "a horrific campaign of ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence" during the siege and capture of el-Fasher. Among those targeted with sanctions were an RSF brigadier general who filmed himself killing unarmed civilians as well as a major general and RSF field commander. In the absence of effective prevention and accountability, the Fact-Finding Mission considers that the risk of further genocidal acts remains serious and ongoing, as Sudan's brutal civil war continues to create Africa's worst humanitarian crisis with millions displaced and famine conditions spreading across multiple regions.

### 5. At Least 50 Killed in Armed Attack on Village in Nigeria's Zamfara State
*Feb 21*

> At least 50 people were killed and several women and children were abducted after gunmen attacked the village of Tungan Dutse in Nigeria's Zamfara state, with the assault starting late Thursday night and continuing into Friday morning as armed men arrived on motorcycles and began setting fire to buildings and abducting residents, while Amnesty International reports at least 323 people have been killed in different attacks across six northern states within the first 20 days of February.

At least 50 people were killed and several women and children were abducted after gunmen attacked a village in Nigeria's Zamfara state on February 20-21. The attack started late on Thursday night and continued into Friday morning in Tungan Dutse village in the Bukkuyum area of Zamfara when armed men arrived on motorcycles and began setting fire to buildings and abducting residents. The attackers raided the village from around 5 p.m. on Thursday until about 3:30 a.m. on Friday, burning down buildings and shooting residents who tried to flee, according to local officials and witnesses.

A lawmaker representing Bukkuyum South stated that the gunmen had been "moving from one village to another … leaving at least 50 people dead." Residents said villagers alerted security forces after spotting more than 150 motorcycles carrying armed men a day earlier, but no action was taken to protect the community. The number of people abducted remained unclear as local officials were still compiling lists of the missing, with particular concern for women and children taken by the attackers. The assault represents the latest in a wave of violence across northern Nigeria, where armed bandit groups have terrorized rural communities for years, kidnapping for ransom, stealing livestock, and attacking villages with impunity.

Amnesty International reported that at least 323 people have been killed in different attacks on rural communities across six northern states within the first 20 days of February 2026, with the killings recorded in Benue, Katsina, Kwara, Kebbi, Niger and Zamfara states. The scale of violence underscores the Nigerian government's failure to provide security for citizens in rural areas, where bandits operate with limited interference from overstretched security forces. The attacks have displaced tens of thousands of people, disrupted agricultural production, and created humanitarian crises in communities lacking access to basic services, while the Nigerian military's counterinsurgency operations have failed to eliminate the armed groups or prevent mass casualty attacks on civilian populations.

### 6. EU Convenes Emergency Meeting Over Hungary-Slovakia-Ukraine Druzhba Pipeline Dispute
*Feb 21*

> The European Commission called an extraordinary meeting of its Oil Coordination Group for February 21 to address a growing dispute between Hungary, Slovakia, and Ukraine over the Druzhba oil pipeline, after Budapest and Bratislava halted diesel supplies to Ukraine following a Russian attack that knocked the pipeline out of service, with Hungary blocking a €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine until Kyiv restores the transit of Russian oil to Europe.

The European Commission has called an extraordinary meeting of its Oil Coordination Group to address a growing dispute between Hungary, Slovakia, and Ukraine over the Druzhba oil pipeline. The emergency meeting taking place on Wednesday, February 21, includes participation from Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, as the Commission seeks to mediate a crisis that threatens both energy security and EU-Ukraine relations. Hungary and Slovakia halted diesel supplies to Ukraine after a Russian attack on the pipeline in Ukrainian territory knocked it out of service, with Budapest and Bratislava — who both rely heavily on Russian crude oil transported through the pipeline — accusing Kyiv of deliberately delaying repairs for political reasons.

The disruption began in late January 2026, with the Druzhba pipeline damaged since late January, preventing Russian oil from flowing to Hungary and Slovakia. The pipeline carries Russian crude oil to refineries in central Europe, and its disruption has forced Hungary and Slovakia to seek alternative supplies at higher costs, creating economic pressure on governments already struggling with energy affordability. In January 2026, the European Union adopted legislation requiring all member states to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027, and Hungary and Slovakia have both filed legal challenges against the law, arguing that their geographic position and refinery configurations make them dependent on Russian crude for the near term.

Hungary has stated that it is blocking a €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine until Kyiv restores the transit of Russian oil to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline, creating a direct linkage between the energy dispute and broader EU financial support for Ukraine's war effort and reconstruction. Ukrainian officials have countered that repairs are proceeding as quickly as possible given the scale of damage from Russian strikes, and have offered the Odesa-Brody pipeline as an alternative route for oil supplies to central Europe. The dispute highlights tensions within the EU over energy policy, with some member states prioritizing rapid decoupling from Russian energy while others argue for pragmatic transitions that account for infrastructure realities and economic constraints.

### 7. Israeli Settlers Kill 19-Year-Old Palestinian American in West Bank Village Attack
*Feb 21*

> Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a 19-year-old Palestinian American man named Nasrallah Abu Siyam during an attack on the village of Mukhmas on February 19, with witnesses stating Abu Siyam was trying to stop settlers from attacking a farmer when he was fatally shot, as the Palestinian Authority's Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026 following 240 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and settlers in 2025.

Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a 19-year-old Palestinian American man named Nasrallah Abu Siyam during an attack on the village of Mukhmas on Wednesday, February 19. The incident occurred when a group of settlers came to the village and attacked a farmer, prompting clashes after residents intervened to protect the farmer from assault. Witnesses said Abu Siyam had been trying to stop settlers from attacking the farmer when he was fatally shot. Abu Siyam was an American citizen visiting his village when settlers arrived and attempted to steal sheep from a local farmer, triggering the confrontation that ended in his death.

Israeli forces later arrived at the scene, and during the violence armed settlers killed Abu Siyam and injured several others. The Palestinian Authority's Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Israeli forces and settlers killed 240 Palestinians last year, while Palestinians killed 17 Israelis over the same period, six of whom were soldiers. The Israeli military said late Wednesday that unnamed suspects shot at Palestinians, who were later evacuated for medical treatment, but did not say whether any were arrested — a statement that notably fails to identify the shooters or describe any law enforcement response.

The killing highlights escalating violence in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli settlement expansion and settler attacks on Palestinian communities have intensified since the Gaza war began in October 2023. Human rights organizations have documented a pattern of settler violence occurring with impunity, often with Israeli military forces present but failing to intervene or arrest perpetrators. The US State Department confirmed Abu Siyam's American citizenship and stated it was "deeply disturbed" by his killing, calling for a thorough investigation — though past statements of concern have rarely led to accountability for settler violence against Palestinians, including Palestinian Americans.

### 8. Trump Board of Peace Meeting Secures $7 Billion in Gaza Reconstruction Pledges
*Feb 21*

> President Trump held the inaugural Board of Peace summit on February 20, where members committed at least $7 billion for Gaza reconstruction with funding pledged by Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait, as Trump announced the U.S. would contribute $10 billion though the combined total represents only a small fraction of the roughly $70 billion the UN, EU and World Bank estimate is required to rebuild Gaza.

President Trump held the inaugural Board of Peace summit on Thursday, February 20, where members committed at least $7 billion for Gaza reconstruction, with funding pledged by Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait. Trump also announced that the U.S. would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace initiative, though it was unclear where that funding would be specifically allocated or whether it represents new appropriations or repackaged existing aid commitments. The meeting, attended by representatives of more than 40 countries including several heads of state, marked Trump's effort to establish an alternative international framework for Gaza governance and reconstruction outside traditional UN structures.

Trump stated at the meeting "We will help Gaza," and promised to "straighten it out" and "make it successful" and "peaceful," though he provided no timeline for reconstruction or detailed plans for governance. The $7 billion pledged represents only a small fraction of the roughly $70 billion that the U.N., European Union and World Bank estimated would be required to rebuild Gaza's destroyed infrastructure, housing, hospitals, schools, and economic base. Israel says Gaza will not be rebuilt until Hamas has laid down its weapons and released all hostages, which has emerged as a major sticking point preventing reconstruction from beginning despite the ceasefire that has been in effect since January.

Notable absences from the Board of Peace included several U.S. allies including France and Canada, who opted not to join the organization, saying they fear it seeks to supplant the United Nations as the primary international body responsible for Gaza reconstruction and governance. Critics argue that the Board of Peace represents an attempt to bypass international humanitarian law and existing multilateral mechanisms, while supporters contend that the UN's ineffectiveness in Gaza justifies a new approach. No reconstruction has yet begun on the ground in Gaza, where 2.3 million people face dire humanitarian conditions with limited access to clean water, electricity, medical care, and shelter following 16 months of devastating warfare.

### 9. Norway Withdraws Military Personnel from Iraq Amid US-Iran Tensions
*Feb 21*

> Norway has partially withdrawn its troops from Iraq amid escalating security tensions in the Middle East, relocating approximately 60 military personnel stationed in Iraq and Jordan as tensions between the United States and Iran reach critical levels, while the United States is withdrawing F-35 fighter jets from the NATO exercise Cold Response in northern Norway to redeploy air power to the Middle East.

Norway has partially withdrawn its troops from Iraq amid escalating security tensions in the Middle East, according to an announcement made on February 20. The Norwegian contingent numbers about 60 military personnel in Iraq and Jordan, and the decision to relocate them reflects growing concern about the security environment as tensions between the United States and Iran reach critical levels. The withdrawal comes as part of broader developments related to US-Iran tensions, with multiple countries reassessing their military presence in the region to avoid being caught in potential crossfire.

The United States is withdrawing much of its planned air power, including F-35 fighter jets, from the NATO exercise Cold Response in northern Norway due to rising tensions with Iran, redirecting these strategic assets to the Middle East theater. The decision to pull advanced fighters from a major NATO exercise underscores the seriousness with which US military planners view the Iran situation, as the Pentagon prioritizes readiness for potential Middle East operations over training exercises. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted military exercises near the Strait of Hormuz on Monday, February 17, demonstrating Iran's capability to disrupt global oil shipments through the strategic waterway that handles roughly 20% of the world's petroleum traffic.

Starting in late January 2026, the United States increased its military presence across the Middle East as part of rising tensions with Iran, with the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group deploying to the region on January 26. Multiple carrier strike groups are now positioned in the Middle East, representing one of the largest concentrations of US naval power in the region in recent years. In recent days, both the United States and Iran have exchanged harsh statements and demonstrated their military presence in the region, with Trump issuing a 10-day ultimatum for diplomatic progress and Iranian officials warning of severe retaliation if attacked.

### 10. South Korea's Kospi Hits Fresh Record High Above 5,800 for Second Straight Session
*Feb 21*

> The Kospi index closed 2.31% up at 5,808.53 on Friday, February 20, marking a fresh record high and topping the 5,800-point mark for the first time, as South Korean stocks jumped as high as 5,809.91 during afternoon trading driven by a rally in chip and defense stocks including SK Hynix rising 6.15% and Hanwha Aerospace jumping 8.09%, while institutions led the rise with net purchases of 1.61 trillion won.

The Kospi index closed 2.31% up at 5,808.53 on Friday, February 20, 2026, marking a fresh record high and representing the second straight day of record-breaking performance for South Korean equities. South Korean stocks topped the 5,800-point mark for the first time Friday and jumped as high as 5,809.91 at around 2:37 p.m., as the index surged past key psychological levels on strong investor demand. The index had previously closed at 5,677.25 on Thursday, February 19, after markets reopened following a three-day Lunar New Year holiday, making the Friday rally even more remarkable as momentum continued unabated.

The rally was driven by several factors including a surge in chip and defense stocks, with SK Hynix rising 6.15% and defense giant Hanwha Aerospace jumping 8.09%. Institutions led the rise with net purchases of 1.61 trillion won, demonstrating strong conviction from sophisticated investors about Korean equity valuations and growth prospects. Expectations that upcoming investor-friendly measures will help lift market valuations also supported the rally, as Korean policymakers have signaled intentions to address the "Korea discount" that has historically made Korean stocks trade at lower multiples than regional peers despite strong fundamentals.

The Kospi's remarkable run has been extraordinary, as the index surpassed the 5,000 mark for the first time on January 27 and the 5,500 level on February 12 — meaning the index has gained roughly 16% in less than a month. The dollar dipped after the Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs, while South Korea's Kospi hit a fresh record high for the second straight session, benefiting from both domestic factors and favorable global liquidity conditions. Analysts attribute the rally to multiple factors including strong earnings from semiconductor companies benefiting from AI chip demand, Korea's improving corporate governance practices, expectations for Bank of Korea monetary policy support, and international investors increasing allocations to Korean equities after years of underweighting the market.

### 1. Trump Imposes New 10% Global Tariff After Supreme Court Strikes Down Emergency Levies
*Feb 21*

> President Trump announced on February 20 he would sign an executive order to enact a 10% global tariff after the Supreme Court struck down his previous tariffs in a 6-3 ruling, with the new levy taking effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on February 24 under Section 122 of trade law which allows tariffs for only 150 days absent Congressional extension, as the Supreme Court ruled Trump had asserted "extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope" that violated federal law.

On Friday, February 20, 2026, the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's far-reaching global tariffs, ruling that they violated federal law. The court, in a 6-3 ruling, struck down the tariffs Trump imposed under an emergency powers law, specifically the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority that Trump had asserted "extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope," but the court's majority ruled that IEEPA "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs."

President Trump announced he would sign an executive order to enact a 10% global tariff after the Supreme Court struck down his previous tariffs. Trump announced on social media Friday night that he had signed the 10% global tariff that he previewed earlier in the day, stating he would enact the tariff under a trade law known as Section 122, though these tariffs can only be in place for 150 days absent an extension from Congress. The new levy will take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on February 24, giving markets and businesses less than four days to prepare for the policy change.

Financial markets reacted positively to the Supreme Court ruling despite Trump's subsequent announcement, with the S&P 500 advancing 0.69% to close at 6,909.51, the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.9% to settle at 22,886.07, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 230.81 points (0.47%) to end at 49,625.97. The dollar dipped after the Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs, as traders weighed the implications of constrained executive authority on trade policy. Analysts at Wolfe Research expect "the tariffs will be reconstituted under other authorities," as Treasury Secretary Scot Bessent has previously said the administration has "lots of other authorities that can be used" to impose trade restrictions, suggesting the tariff battle will continue through 2026.

### 2. US GDP Growth Slows to 1.4% in Q4, Core PCE Inflation Jumps to 3% in December
*Feb 21*

> The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on February 20 that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.4% in Q4 2025, significantly below the 2.5% consensus forecast and down from 4.4% growth in Q3, with the government shutdown subtracting 1.0 percentage point from GDP, while Core PCE inflation jumped 0.4% month-over-month in December marking the highest monthly increase since February 2025 and complicating the Federal Reserve's rate cut timeline.

The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on February 20 that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 according to the advance estimate, representing a significant slowdown from the third quarter when real GDP increased 4.4 percent. The 1.4% growth rate came in well below the Dow Jones economists' expectations of 2.5% gain for the period, with the government shutdown being cited as a major factor in the disappointing result. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the reduction in services provided by the federal government subtracted about 1.0 percentage point from real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation report released simultaneously showed inflation figures for December 2025 that came in hotter than expected. The PCE index rose 0.4% in December on a monthly basis and is up 2.9% from a year ago — figures that were both slightly above the estimate of LSEG economists, who predicted 0.3% and 2.8%, respectively. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, which excludes food and energy and represents the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, was up 0.4% on a monthly basis and rose 3.0% year over year, with the monthly increase representing the highest level since last February.

The combination of weak GDP and sticky inflation creates a stagflation-lite scenario that keeps the Fed pinned at 3.50-3.75% with no cuts expected before June at the earliest. Federal Reserve officials had signaled at their January meeting that further rate cuts should be paused, with some officials even entertaining the notion that rate hikes could be on the table if inflation remains elevated. The December PCE data provides ammunition to those FOMC members who argued for a more restrictive policy stance and suggests that the timeline for the next rate cut may be pushed further into 2026, with most major financial institutions having already moved their expectations for the next rate cut to June 2026 or later.

### 3. Nvidia Earnings on February 25 Draw Intense Scrutiny as Wall Street Expects $67 Billion Revenue
*Feb 21*

> Nvidia reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on February 25 after market close, with Wall Street expecting roughly $65.7 billion in revenue (up 67% year over year) and earnings of $1.52 per share, though some analysts predict the company could hit $67-76 billion as CEO Jensen Huang described demand for the B200 and GB200 chips as "off the charts" and "insane," with Polymarket traders pricing in 94.5% probability Nvidia beats the EPS consensus.

Nvidia reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on February 25, 2026 after market close, in what may be the most scrutinized earnings report of the quarter given the company's central role in the AI infrastructure buildout. Wall Street expects roughly $65.7 billion in revenue, up 67% year over year, though some analysts are more bullish. Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider predicts $67.3 billion in quarterly revenue — roughly $2 billion higher than the broader market consensus. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik expects Nvidia to potentially hit $67 billion, while UBS analyst Arcuri expects $76 billion in revenue, reflecting the wide range of estimates for a company whose business is growing at unprecedented rates.

Wall Street expects earnings of $1.52 per share, and Polymarket traders are pricing in 94.5% probability Nvidia beats the $1.52 EPS consensus, reflecting the company's strong track record of exceeding expectations. The artificial intelligence tech leader has beaten the analyst consensus earnings estimate in 20 of the past 22 quarters, establishing a pattern of outperformance that has made Nvidia one of the most reliable earnings beats in the technology sector. CEO Jensen Huang described demand for the B200 and GB200 chips as "off the charts" and "insane," confirming the company is effectively sold out through the middle of 2026.

Multiple price target increases have been issued ahead of the earnings report, with UBS raising NVDA stock's price target from $235 to $245 and Bank of America maintaining a "Buy" rating with a price target of $275. Nvidia's guidance assumed no data center AI chip sales to China, which could provide upside if resumed as geopolitical tensions ease or export restrictions are modified. The earnings report comes at a critical moment for AI infrastructure spending, as investors question whether the current pace of capital expenditure by hyperscale cloud providers is sustainable or whether a pause in AI buildout could emerge in 2026-2027, making Nvidia's commentary on customer demand and forward guidance particularly important for the entire technology sector.

### 4. Home Depot and Alibaba Set to Report Earnings February 24 as Consumer Spending Tests Continue

> Home Depot will hold its Fourth Quarter & Fiscal Year Earnings Conference Call on Tuesday, February 24 at 9 a.m. ET before market open, providing a critical read on US consumer spending and housing market trends, while Alibaba reports quarterly results for the period ending December 31 with analysts expecting continued cloud revenue growth and questions about Chinese consumer demand amid the country's ongoing property downturn.

Home Depot will hold its Fourth Quarter & Fiscal Year Earnings Conference Call on Tuesday, February 24, at 9 a.m. ET, with results released before the market opens. The home improvement retailer's earnings will provide a critical read on US consumer spending and housing market trends, as Home Depot's sales reflect both do-it-yourself consumer activity and professional contractor demand linked to new home construction and renovation projects. Investors will focus on comparable store sales growth, average ticket size, and transaction counts to assess whether consumers are pulling back on discretionary home improvement spending amid elevated mortgage rates and economic uncertainty.

Alibaba is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on February 24 for the period ending December 31, 2025. The Chinese e-commerce and cloud computing giant's results will be closely watched for signs of recovery in Chinese consumer spending and the success of the company's cloud and international expansion strategies. Analysts expect continued strong growth in Alibaba's cloud division, which has posted double-digit percentage gains as AI-related product revenue has achieved triple-digit growth for six consecutive quarters. However, questions remain about the core e-commerce business as Chinese consumers face economic headwinds including the ongoing property sector downturn and weak consumer confidence.

The juxtaposition of Home Depot and Alibaba reporting on the same day provides investors with simultaneous reads on the world's two largest consumer markets — the United States and China — at a time when both economies face distinct challenges. Home Depot's results will test the resilience of American consumers who have faced elevated interest rates, inflation, and economic uncertainty, while Alibaba's numbers will reveal whether Chinese stimulus measures and policy support are translating into improved consumer spending. Both companies have experienced stock volatility in 2026, with investors uncertain about the outlook for consumer discretionary spending amid persistent macroeconomic crosscurrents.

### 5. Bank of England Holds Rate at 3.75% in Narrow 5-4 Vote as Inflation Remains Above Target
*Feb 21*

> The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 5-4 to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% at its meeting ending February 4, with four members voting to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.5%, as CPI inflation ticked up to 3.4% in December 2025 remaining above the Bank's 2% target though inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April owing to developments in energy prices.

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 5-4 to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% at its meeting ending on February 4, 2026, in one of the closest votes in recent years. Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%, reflecting significant division within the committee about the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The narrow vote underscores uncertainty about the UK economic outlook, with some MPC members concerned that restrictive policy is no longer necessary given moderating inflation pressures, while others worry that premature easing could allow inflation to become entrenched above target.

CPI inflation ticked up to 3.4% in December 2025, which remains above the Bank's 2% target, though the MPC assessment indicates that inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April owing to developments in energy prices including measures announced in Budget 2025. The uptick in inflation from 2.6% in November to 3.4% in December was driven primarily by energy price base effects and some services inflation persistence, though core goods inflation has continued to moderate. The Bank's forecast suggests that inflation will return to near the 2% target by mid-2026, though significant uncertainty surrounds this projection given global energy market volatility and domestic wage pressures.

The decision to hold rates at 3.75% comes as the UK economy navigates a delicate balance between supporting growth and ensuring inflation returns sustainably to target. Prime Minister Starmer's government has made economic growth its top priority, and some officials have privately expressed concern that excessively tight monetary policy could undermine efforts to boost business investment and productivity growth. The Bank of England's next scheduled rate decision will be announced on March 19, 2026, when the committee will have access to updated inflation data and can assess whether the predicted moderation in price pressures is materializing as forecast.

### 6. Active Management Gains Ground as Market Volatility Rewards Tactical Positioning
*Feb 21*

> A noisy, unsettled Wall Street is making active fund managers look smart again after years of underperformance, as a market rattled by tariff whiplash, AI disruption fears, brewing Middle East conflict and stretched valuations has rewarded tactical positioning, with Bloomberg reporting that Wall Street's "smart money" is gaining ground as passive investing lags in 2026 after dominating for over a decade.

A noisy, unsettled Wall Street is doing what years of simply owning the index rarely has: made the smart money look smart again. In a market rattled by tariff whiplash, AI disruption fears, a brewing Middle East conflict and stretched valuations, getting tactical has paid off in ways that a decade of devotion to buy and hold did not. Bloomberg reports that Wall Street's "smart money" is gaining ground as passive investing lags in 2026, representing a potential inflection point in the multi-decade shift toward index funds and exchange-traded funds that has defined the investment management industry since the global financial crisis.

Passive large-blend strategies have outperformed active large-blend strategies for eight consecutive years leading up to 2022, and then again in 2023 and 2024, establishing index funds as the default choice for most retail and institutional investors. However, the challenging 2026 market environment characterized by sector rotation, elevated volatility, and dispersed stock returns has created conditions where stock selection and risk management skills can add value. Only 24% of active funds have outperformed a passive alternative over 10 years, and just 29% outperformed over the year through November 2025, yet early 2026 data suggests active managers are having more success navigating the current environment.

Market concentration has been a double-edged sword for active managers, as Nvidia alone accounted for 20% of the rise in the S&P 500 in 2024, and the average S&P 500 index fund had 28% of the portfolio's market cap invested in the seven largest tech giants, making it particularly difficult for active managers to outperform by underweighting megacap technology stocks. However, in 2026 the narrative has shifted, as concerns about AI sustainability and valuation have led to underperformance in the "Magnificent Seven" stocks that dominated 2023-2025 returns. Active managers who reduced exposure to expensive technology names and increased allocations to financials, energy, and international markets have outperformed, demonstrating that cyclical nature of active versus passive returns over longer periods.

### 7. US Dollar Index Falls After Tariff Ruling Despite Firm Economic Data, Down 8% Over 12 Months
*Feb 21*

> The DXY exchange rate rose to 97.87 on February 19 as firm US industrial production and core capital goods orders data reduced expectations for multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026, yet over the past 12 months the United States Dollar has weakened 8.00% reflecting the dollar's worst annual performance since 2017, while the EUR/USD trades at 1.19 and GBP/USD around 1.34-1.35 as markets process divergent economic data and geopolitical developments.

The DXY exchange rate rose to 97.87 on February 19, 2026, up 0.17% from the previous session, as the US Dollar Index (DXY) climbed toward 98 near a four-week high amid firm US economic data and a more hawkish Federal Reserve tone that reduced expectations for multiple rate cuts this year. The greenback was supported by data showing US industrial production rose at its fastest pace in nearly a year, core capital goods orders exceeded forecasts, and housing starts reached a five-month high — a constellation of indicators suggesting the US economy retains more momentum than many analysts had anticipated. However, the dollar dipped after the Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs on February 20, as traders weighed the implications of constrained executive authority on trade policy.

Over the past 12 months, the United States Dollar has weakened 8.00%, representing the dollar's worst annual performance since 2017 and reflecting a combination of factors including narrowing interest rate differentials as other central banks maintain restrictive policy, concerns about US fiscal sustainability as the federal debt tops $38 trillion, and geopolitical developments that have reduced the dollar's safe-haven premium. As of mid-February 2026, the US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading in the high-90s, close to recent multi-month lows, having fallen from levels above 106 that prevailed in late 2025.

The EUR/USD is trading at critical resistance level in the 1.19 area, having strengthened significantly from levels below 1.05 that prevailed during the peak of the European energy crisis in 2025, while GBP/USD is trading around 1.34-1.35, well above the 2025 lows near 1.20 and reflecting improved sentiment about the UK economy under Prime Minister Starmer's government. Major currency pairs are experiencing elevated volatility as markets process divergent economic data, central bank policy signals, and geopolitical developments including US-Iran tensions, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and trade policy uncertainty. Forex strategists note that dollar weakness may overwhelm seasonal tendencies that typically support the greenback in February, with the combination of disappointing Q4 GDP data (1.4% vs 2.5% expected) and hot PCE inflation (0.4% monthly core) creating a challenging policy environment for the Federal Reserve.

### 8. Semiconductor Stocks Split as Applied Materials and TSMC Rally While Intel Guides Below Expectations
*Feb 21*

> Applied Materials surged after reporting Q1 revenue of $7.01 billion and CEO Gary Dickerson stating the company expects to grow its semiconductor equipment business over 20% in calendar year 2026 fueled by AI computing investments, while Taiwan Semiconductor posted 37% monthly revenue growth outpacing its 30% full-year target, as Intel dropped sharply after guiding Q1 revenue to $11.7-12.7 billion citing memory supply constraints.

Applied Materials surged after reporting Q1 fiscal 2026 revenue of $7.01 billion and beating earnings estimates, with CEO Gary Dickerson stating the company expects to grow its semiconductor equipment business over 20% in calendar year 2026, fueled by acceleration of industry investments in AI computing infrastructure. The strong guidance reflects Applied Materials' position as a critical supplier of deposition, etching, and inspection equipment used in advanced chip manufacturing, and indicates that semiconductor foundries and memory manufacturers are maintaining aggressive capital expenditure programs despite macroeconomic uncertainty. The company benefits from multiple growth drivers including the transition to Gate-All-Around transistor architectures, high-bandwidth memory production expansion, and advanced packaging technologies required for AI accelerators.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) posted monthly revenue growth of 37% in its latest report, significantly outpacing the 30% full-year growth rate target the company set for 2026, as demand continues accelerating for leading-edge chip production capacity. Shares of Taiwan Semi are already up more than 20% year-to-date as TSMC captures the majority of production for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other designers of advanced AI and computing chips that require the most sophisticated manufacturing processes. Micron Technology extended its rally after the company projected record Q2 revenue of $18.70 billion with 68% gross margins, reflecting the extraordinary profitability of memory chips amid supply constraints and surging AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory used in GPU clusters.

Intel dropped sharply after guiding Q1 2026 revenue to $11.7-12.7 billion, citing memory supply constraints affecting handset demand and continued weakness in the PC market, while Nvidia shares fell on February 20 following commentary from Arista Networks' CEO that pointed to the GPU giant losing market share in certain AI networking segments to competitors including Broadcom and custom solutions from hyperscale cloud providers. The divergence in semiconductor stock performance reflects investor discrimination between companies positioned at the core of AI infrastructure buildout (Applied Materials, TSMC, Micron) and those facing competitive or cyclical headwinds (Intel). Analysts note that while the semiconductor sector is expected to surpass $1 trillion in annual sales for the first time in 2026, growth will be concentrated in AI-related segments while traditional computing and consumer electronics markets remain weak.

### 9. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.01%, Lowest Level Since September 2022, as Spring Buying Season Approaches
*Feb 21*

> Freddie Mac's 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, down from 6.09% the prior week and representing the lowest level since September 2022, as the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35% down from 5.44%, with borrowers taking out a $450,000 loan at today's lower rates able to shave more than $200 off their monthly mortgage payment compared to a year ago when rates averaged 6.85%.

Freddie Mac's 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, 2026, down from 6.09% last week and representing the lowest level since September 2022, providing homebuyers with improved affordability as the spring buying season approaches. The current average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 6.24% as of Friday, February 20, 2026, according to Bankrate's national survey, with the 30-year fixed mortgage APR averaging 6.30% — figures that reflect modest variation across lenders but confirm the downward trend in borrowing costs. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35%, down from 5.44% the prior week according to Freddie Mac, offering a more attractive option for borrowers able to handle higher monthly payments in exchange for lower total interest costs.

Borrowers taking out a $450,000 loan at today's lower rates could shave more than $200 off their mortgage payment compared to a year ago, when 30-year fixed rates averaged 6.85%, translating to approximately $2,400 in annual savings and meaningfully improving housing affordability for potential buyers who have been sidelined by elevated borrowing costs. Mortgage rates are moving lower as financial markets price in potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2026, despite the hot PCE inflation data released February 20 that complicates the Fed's monetary policy calculus. The decline in mortgage rates from the 7%+ levels that prevailed through much of 2025 has begun to unlock some housing market activity, with pending home sales data showing modest improvement in recent weeks.

J.P. Morgan Global Research sees U.S. house prices stalling at 0% growth in 2026, with a slight improvement in demand likely offsetting any increased supply as builders continue delivering units started in prior years. While fixed-rate mortgage rates are projected to stay elevated at 6%+ through most of 2026, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates could tick downward if the Fed decides to ease monetary policy in the second half of the year — a scenario that would provide additional support for housing market activity. The 2026 real estate outlook compiled by the National Association of Realtors suggests that while elevated mortgage rates remain a headwind, the spring buying season could see improved transaction volumes as potential buyers adjust expectations to the "new normal" of 6% rates rather than waiting for a return to the sub-4% rates that prevailed during the pandemic era.

### 10. Warner Bros. Discovery Faces February 23 Deadline as Paramount Window Closes
*Feb 21*

> Warner Bros. Discovery announced on February 17 it is reopening deal discussions with Paramount Skydance after Netflix granted a limited waiver permitting WBD to engage with Paramount for a seven-day window ending February 23, as Paramount CEO David Ellison sweetened his offer to $31 per share with a commitment to cover the $2.8 billion Netflix breakup fee and a "ticking fee" of $650 million per quarter if the deal is not completed by end of 2026.

Warner Bros. Discovery announced on February 17 that it is reopening deal discussions with Paramount Skydance after Netflix granted a limited waiver under the terms of WBD's existing merger agreement with the streaming giant, permitting WBD to engage with Paramount Skydance for a seven-day window ending February 23, 2026. The development sets up a dramatic climax to one of the most complex media consolidation sagas in decades, as WBD faces a critical decision point on whether to proceed with its December 2025 agreement to sell most of itself to Netflix for $72 billion in equity at $27.72 per share (excluding cable channels including CNN), or to accept Paramount CEO David Ellison's competing all-cash offer that has been sweetened to $31 per share for the entire company including the cable assets.

Paramount's sweetened February offer added significant inducements designed to make the deal economically compelling for WBD shareholders: a promise to cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee WBD would owe Netflix if it abandoned the streaming deal, a commitment to backstop a refinancing that would cut WBD's debt costs by $1.5 billion annually, and a "ticking fee" of $650 million per quarter in cash if the Paramount-WBD deal is not completed by end of 2026 — effectively compensating shareholders for any delay in deal closure. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos responded with characteristic confidence, telling media "let them make a move," while confirming Netflix's merger agreement with WBD remains the company's preferred outcome.

WBD announced it will hold a special shareholder meeting on March 20 at which it will recommend voting to approve the Netflix deal, meaning the one-week Paramount window running through February 23 is a genuine opportunity for Paramount to make a case to the WBD board that its offer materially exceeds the Netflix deal's value to shareholders. The outcome will help determine whether Hollywood's most coveted content library — including Warner Bros.' DC Comics franchise, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and HBO's prestige television catalog — combines with Netflix's distribution platform to create a vertically integrated streaming colossus, or becomes part of a reconstituted old-media giant under Ellison's Paramount umbrella. The combined WBD-Netflix entity would be valued at approximately $100 billion including debt, while a WBD-Paramount combination would create an $80 billion company with significantly different strategic positioning.
