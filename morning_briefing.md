### 1. Winter Olympics 2026 Opens with Historic Dual Cauldron Lighting in Milan and Cortina
*Feb 6*

> The 2026 Winter Olympics opened with a spectacular ceremony at Milan's San Siro stadium, marking the first time in Olympic history that two cauldrons were lit simultaneously — one in Milan at the Arco della Pace and another in Cortina d'Ampezzo at Piazza Dibona.

Over 2,900 athletes from 93 countries marched in the Parade of Nations as the Games officially began. The ceremony featured performances from Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli, Laura Pausini, and Italian rapper Ghali, along with world-renowned pianist Lang Lang. Actor Pierfrancesco Favino and The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore also participated in the festivities. The dual cauldron lighting represented the geographical spread of the Games across the Lombardy and Veneto regions.

The opening ceremony took place from 2 PM to 5 PM ET, with activations occurring simultaneously in Predazzo, Livigno, and Cortina d'Ampezzo in addition to the main Milan venue. Greece led the Parade of Nations as the birthplace of the Olympics, followed by the other delegations in alphabetical order according to Italian. The event organizers emphasized the sustainable and innovative aspects of these Games, which span multiple competition venues across northern Italy.

Italy's first Winter Olympics since Turin 2006 comes amid significant global attention, with the ceremony broadcast to an estimated worldwide audience of over 1 billion viewers. Competition begins immediately in several sports including figure skating and ski jumping. The Games will run through February 22, featuring 116 medal events across 16 disciplines.

### 2. Balochistan Attacks Kill Over 225 as Pakistan Launches Massive Counterterrorism Operation
*Feb 3*

> The Balochistan Liberation Army launched "Operation Herof 2.0," a coordinated assault across at least nine districts of Pakistan's Balochistan province, triggering a 40-hour military response that left at least 225 dead including militants, security personnel, and civilians.

The attacks began around 3:00 AM local time on January 31, targeting police stations, paramilitary outposts, a high-security prison in Quetta, and civilian vehicles across Quetta, Gwadar, Mastung, Nushki, Pasni, and Kharan. Militants employed guns, grenades, and suicide vests in what Pakistani officials described as the most significant coordinated insurgent operation in years. BLA released videos showing female fighters participating in the attacks, labeling the operation a follow-up to their August 2024 offensive.

Pakistani military and police forces announced the conclusion of operations on February 5, claiming to have killed 145 BLA fighters while acknowledging the deaths of 17 security personnel and 31 civilians. The BLA disputed these figures, claiming to have killed 280 security personnel and captured 18 prisoners, though provided no evidence. Pakistan deployed helicopters and drones to end the standoff, with security operations extending across multiple remote districts of the restive province.

The attacks highlight the ongoing insurgency in Pakistan's largest but least populated province, where separatist groups have waged a decades-long campaign against the central government. The BLA, designated a terrorist organization by Pakistan, the UK, and the US, seeks independence for the ethnic Baloch people and has increasingly targeted Chinese interests in the region, including the strategic Gwadar port. The scale of the coordinated attacks represents a significant escalation in the conflict.

### 3. Sudan Famine Spreads as Acute Malnutrition Reaches Crisis Levels in Darfur
*Feb 5*

> Acute malnutrition has reached famine levels in two additional towns in Sudan's North Darfur region, with nearly 53% of children under five suffering from acute malnutrition in Um Baru — almost double the famine threshold — according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.

Sudan now represents the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions confirmed in Al Fasher and Kadugli and the risk of famine in 20 additional areas across Greater Darfur and Greater Kordofan. Nearly 4.2 million cases of acute malnutrition are expected in 2026, including more than 800,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition — a sharp increase from 2025 levels. The UN reports that hunger is expected to worsen from February as food stocks run out and fighting continues.

The humanitarian catastrophe stems from the civil war that erupted in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, which has displaced over 12 million people. In the western regions of Sudan — notably North Darfur, South Darfur, West Kordofan, and South Kordofan — conflict and severely restricted humanitarian access are driving the sharp deterioration. More than 70 percent of Sudan's hospitals have been destroyed, and UN officials estimate that rehabilitating essential infrastructure will cost $350 million.

The World Food Programme and UNICEF have called for urgent international action to address the crisis, but aid delivery remains severely constrained by ongoing conflict and access restrictions. The government has declared 2026 "the Year of Peace" under a National Peace Initiative, but fighting continues in multiple regions. The UN Security Council is expected to receive a 120-day briefing on Sudan in February, with the UK — holding the Council's rotating presidency — planning to elevate the session to ministerial level.

### 4. UAE Plans Housing Complex for Displaced Palestinians in Israeli-Controlled Southern Gaza
*Feb 5*

> The United Arab Emirates has drafted plans to build the "UAE Temporary Emirates Housing Complex" to house thousands of displaced Palestinians in a part of southern Gaza under Israeli military control near Rafah, according to maps obtained by Reuters and Haaretz.

The proposed compound would sit near the "Yellow Line" agreed under an October ceasefire to demarcate Israeli- and Hamas-controlled areas. Rafah, once home to a quarter million people near the Egypt border, has been almost completely destroyed and depopulated by Israeli forces. The housing plan is part of broader reconstruction efforts expected to begin under U.S. President Donald Trump's framework for a durable peace, with American officials hoping that building in Israeli-controlled areas could generate momentum toward Hamas' disarmament.

The "Alternative Safe Communities" concept was designed as a way of gradually "choking Hamas off" by encouraging Gazans to leave Hamas-controlled zones, depriving the militant group of its civilian population. However, for the strategy to be effective, it would need to be built at scale, housing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Diplomats have expressed doubt about whether Palestinians would voluntarily move to areas under Israeli control.

International donors have been reluctant to commit funds to the plan, worried that disagreements over disarming Hamas militants could lead the parties back to full-scale conflict. The proposal has also raised concerns about potentially creating a permanent division of Gaza. Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions remain dire: UNRWA reports that Israel has blocked approximately 6,000 aid trucks destined for Gaza, with protesters blocking border crossings at Nitzana and Karem Abu Salem throughout early February.

### 5. Japan Heads to Snap Election as PM Takaichi Seeks Mandate for Ruling Coalition
*Feb 6*

> Japanese voters head to the polls on February 8 in snap elections called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female premier, who is seeking to translate historically high approval ratings into a clear mandate for her Liberal Democratic Party-Japan Innovation Party coalition.

The election comes just four months into Takaichi's tenure, which began on October 21, 2025, after she won the LDP presidential election. Polls show the LDP and its coalition partner are likely to secure more than 300 of the 465 seats in the House of Representatives, well above the 233 needed for a majority. Takaichi's cabinet approval rating stands at 62% in NHK surveys, with some polls placing her support in the 70% range — historically high figures that prompted the decision to call early elections.

The political landscape has been reshaped by a surprise opposition merger. On January 16, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, joined with Komeito — the LDP's former coalition partner for 26 years — to create a new party called the "Centrist Reform Alliance." This realignment marks a significant shift in Japanese politics, with Komeito's departure from its longtime alliance with the LDP potentially signaling broader changes in the country's political dynamics.

Takaichi's economic program includes significant spending plans and potential tax relief measures that will be put before voters. The election is being closely watched internationally, particularly given Japan's strategic role in the U.S.-led alliance system in the Indo-Pacific and ongoing tensions with China over Taiwan. Analysts note that snap elections can be risky, but Takaichi appears to have calculated that her current popularity provides an optimal window to consolidate power.

### 6. US-Iran Indirect Talks End "For Now" in Oman After Critical Nuclear Negotiations
*Feb 6*

> Iran announced that indirect talks with the United States mediated by Oman have concluded "for now," following days of critical negotiations in Muscat where Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met separately with Omani officials and U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

The talks represented a significant diplomatic effort amid weeks of escalating tensions, with negotiations shifting from the originally planned venue of Istanbul to Oman at the last minute. The Omani Foreign Minister served as intermediary, shuttling between the Iranian and American delegations. While specific details of the discussions remain confidential, the negotiations are understood to have focused on Iran's nuclear program and the broader regional security situation.

The talks come amid a severe domestic crisis in Iran, where protests have resulted in thousands of deaths according to human rights organizations. In a notable development during the lead-up to negotiations, Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi reportedly sent a personal message to U.S. Special Envoy Witkoff stating that Iran had canceled the planned execution of 800 anti-regime protesters. The international community has intensified pressure on Tehran, with the EU designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.

Oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz have increased speed amid the heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran. The talks' inconclusive ending — characterized by Iran as suspended "for now" rather than collapsed — leaves open the possibility of resumed negotiations, though the timeline and conditions remain unclear. Both sides face significant domestic political constraints that complicate any potential agreement.

### 7. Starmer Apologizes to Epstein Victims as Mandelson Scandal Deepens UK Leadership Crisis
*Feb 5*

> British Prime Minister Keir Starmer apologized to Jeffrey Epstein's victims for appointing Peter Mandelson as U.S. Ambassador, as Scotland Yard launched a criminal investigation into the veteran Labour politician on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he shared government information with the convicted sex offender.

The scandal has plunged Starmer's government into crisis, with Labour MPs describing the party mood as "febrile and mutinous." Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party on February 1 and has since stepped down from the House of Lords amid mounting scrutiny. Leaked documents revealed serious allegations including reports that Mandelson and his husband received payments from Epstein, and that in 2009 and 2010, Mandelson allegedly passed sensitive government information to the financier.

Starmer defended his initial decision to appoint Mandelson, stating: "If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government." Officials are reportedly drafting legislation to fast-track the removal of Mandelson's peerage. The Prime Minister is facing growing calls for his resignation, with critics arguing his handling of the issue has undermined public trust and raised national security concerns stemming from poor vetting processes.

The crisis comes at a challenging time for the UK government, with borrowing costs under pressure and the pound facing volatility. UK gilt yields have risen as markets assess the political uncertainty. The scandal has dominated British media coverage and Parliament, overshadowing the government's policy agenda. Opposition leaders have demanded a full independent inquiry into how Mandelson's appointment was approved despite his documented connections to Epstein.

### 8. Taiwan-China Tensions Escalate as Beijing Masses 100,000 Troops for Strait Exercises
*Feb 5*

> China has assembled nearly 100,000 troops along the Taiwan Strait for military exercises, with December drills involving 90 aircraft sorties crossing the center line, four amphibious assault ship formations, and 19 Chinese ships entering Taiwan's 24-mile buffer zone in what analysts describe as rehearsals for blockade scenarios.

The "Justice Mission" exercises marked the first instance of Chinese military and coast guard vessels entering Taiwan's contiguous zone in significant numbers, representing a significant escalation in Beijing's pressure campaign. The late-year drills were widely interpreted as practice for coercive scenarios short of outright war — particularly a blockade or quarantine designed to strangle Taiwan economically and politically without triggering immediate global conflict.

Pentagon assessments indicate China aims to achieve by 2027 the capabilities required to prevail in a Taiwan conflict involving the United States. This requires three integrated strategic capabilities: the ability to credibly win at acceptable cost, deterring or constraining American intervention, and deterring involvement of U.S. allies and partners. The U.S. recently approved an $11 billion arms package for Taiwan and condemned Beijing's "provocative" military drills.

Despite the military buildup, life in Taiwan continues largely normally, with residents expressing determination rather than fear. The State Department has urged "Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue." However, China has rejected such calls, framing U.S. arms sales as the primary threat to cross-strait stability. Analysts note that while invasion remains unlikely in the near term, the risk of miscalculation during increasingly aggressive exercises continues to grow.

### 9. Mexico's Sheinbaum Defies Trump, Vows Nation "Will Never Be Colony or Protectorate"
*Feb 5*

> Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum delivered a defiant address marking the 109th anniversary of Mexico's 1917 Constitution, declaring "México no regresará a ser colonia ni protectorado de nadie" (Mexico will not return to being a colony or protectorate of anyone) while pledging to protect national resources.

The speech came amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration over immigration, trade, and cartel violence. Sheinbaum directly rebutted Trump's assertions that criminal organizations control Mexico, stating on February 4: "It is false that cartels govern Mexico." The rhetorical confrontation follows Trump's characterization of Mexico as a "narco-state" and his threats of significant tariffs and other punitive measures.

Despite the tensions, Mexico has maintained humanitarian assistance to Cuba, with Sheinbaum pledging to send food and other supplies while pursuing diplomatic channels to continue oil shipments "without seeking confrontation." The Cuba issue has become another flashpoint with Washington, as Trump has escalated pressure on the island nation by cutting off oil supplies. Mexico's position reflects its traditional foreign policy principles of non-intervention and solidarity with Latin American neighbors.

Sheinbaum has also focused on domestic infrastructure development, conducting a two-day tour of Sonora where she inaugurated a highway and announced plans for a port modernization project on the Gulf of California. Her approval ratings remain strong despite the external pressures, as she seeks to balance Mexico's critical economic relationship with the United States against assertions of national sovereignty. The Trump administration's deportation operations and trade threats continue to test the bilateral relationship.

### 10. North Korea Dismisses Vice Premier Ahead of Major Party Congress Unveiling Nuclear Plans
*Feb 4*

> Kim Jong Un has dismissed a vice premier over troubles in a factory modernization project as he tightens discipline among officials ahead of a major Workers' Party congress where North Korea plans to unveil "next-stage plans for further bolstering up the country's nuclear war deterrent."

The upcoming party congress, the first of its kind in five years, represents one of the authoritarian regime's biggest propaganda spectacles and is intended to review projects, establish political and economic priorities, and reshuffle officials. Kim has been focusing on showcasing agricultural and infrastructure achievements, opening North Korea's largest greenhouse farm on the Chinese border and inaugurating the Sambaing Stockbreeding Farm with "fashionable houses," a solar power station, hospital, and kindergarten.

Rising revenues from foreign trade and cybercrime are giving Kim greater policy options, enabling him to suppress certain economic sectors and pursue military priorities with fewer constraints. The regime ordered boosted missile production in 2026 and has conducted multiple ballistic missile tests in recent months. The Congress will likely formalize new military doctrines and potentially announce leadership changes as Kim consolidates power.

Human Rights Watch's annual report described North Korea as maintaining "unrelenting repression, hunger, and inequality," noting continued severe restrictions on freedoms and information. The international community has limited visibility into internal regime dynamics, though analysts suggest the dismissal of senior officials signals ongoing concerns about meeting Kim's ambitious modernization targets. The party congress dates have not been officially announced but are expected in the coming weeks.

### 1. Wall Street Selloff Turns Into Stampede as Emerging Markets Post Worst Week Since November
*Feb 6*

> Wall Street's retreat from risk accelerated into a full stampede this week, with emerging markets on track for their steepest weekly decline since November as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 1.5% on Friday and Korean shares triggered a circuit breaker after a 5% dive in the KOSPI.

The selloff has been driven by a steady drumbeat of negative news stoking anxiety about valuations many suspected had already run up too far. Alphabet's announcement of up to $185 billion in 2026 AI capital expenditures spooked investors concerned about the financial impact of massive AI investments. Rather than a single trigger, the rout reflects accumulated concerns about tech valuations, rising layoffs, and uncertainty over monetary policy.

The S&P 500 has now turned negative for 2026 after losing 1.23% on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.59%. Korean markets saw three program-trading halts in five sessions during one of the most volatile weeks in recent years, with the Kospi falling more than 5% in a single session before retail investors stepped in to prevent a break below 5,000. The carnage has spread across asset classes, with gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies all experiencing sharp declines.

The broader market tracked declines across Asian peers after Wall Street closed mostly lower overnight, amid a persistent tech sector selloff. Most "Magnificent Seven" mega-cap names remain under pressure, though the divergence between AI infrastructure enablers and application-layer software companies has become increasingly pronounced. Investors face limited visibility with the January jobs report delayed indefinitely due to the government shutdown.

### 2. US January Layoffs Hit Highest Level Since 2009 as Hiring Plans Collapse
*Feb 5*

> U.S.-based employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January — a threefold increase from December and more than double January 2025 — marking the highest January layoff total since 2009, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

About 40% of the January layoff announcements came from just two firms: UPS (30,000 cuts tied to its wind-down of Amazon delivery arrangements) and Amazon (16,000 cuts). The healthcare industry announced more than 17,000 job cuts, the highest in that sector since April 2020. January's layoff announcements were concentrated in five industries: transportation, technology, healthcare and health products, chemicals, and financial services.

Companies announced just 5,306 new hires in January, also the lowest for the month since Challenger began tracking the data in 2009. Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 31 rose to 231,000, an increase of 22,000 from the prior week. The data paints a picture of a "low-hire, low-fire" environment that appears to be deteriorating as employers grow pessimistic about the 2026 outlook.

The labor market weakness comes at a particularly challenging time, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics unable to release the January jobs report due to the government shutdown. "Most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026," noted Andy Challenger. The data may fuel concerns among Federal Reserve policymakers about whether additional support is needed for the economy.

### 3. AMD Crashes 17% in Worst Rout Since 2017 as AI Guidance Disappoints
*Feb 4*

> Advanced Micro Devices suffered its worst single-day decline since 2017, plunging 17% after issuing first-quarter guidance that fell short of the market's most bullish AI expectations despite posting record Q4 revenue of $10.27 billion — up 23% year-over-year.

The selloff erased more than $60 billion in market capitalization in a single trading session, with shares closing at $200.19. AMD guided Q1 revenue of approximately $9.8 billion — a 5% sequential decline that investors interpreted as a sign of slowing momentum despite the figure exceeding analyst consensus of $9.38 billion. In a market conditioned to expect "Nvidia-style" exponential growth every quarter, this seasonal dip triggered massive profit-taking.

Prior to the crash, AMD shares had roughly doubled over the past year amid the AI infrastructure boom. CEO Lisa Su noted that the company is in "active discussions" for additional sales of its next-generation MI450 chip, with the ramp "on schedule to start in the second half of the year." However, concerns mounted that a significant portion of Q4 data center revenue came from $390 million in China-bound AI chip sales approved under a U.S. license.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest responded to the crash by purchasing $28 million in AMD shares. Deutsche Bank maintained a hold rating, noting the second half of 2026 could be an inflection point, while Barclays maintained an overweight rating with a $300 price target implying 24% upside. The reaction reflects a broader challenge facing semiconductor companies outside of Nvidia: even strong results are being punished when guidance fails to meet the most optimistic scenarios.

### 4. Oracle Announces $50 Billion Capital Raise for Cloud Infrastructure Expansion
*Feb 1*

> Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion in 2026 through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, reflecting the unprecedented scale of financing needed to meet AI-driven demand from major customers including AMD, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, TikTok, and xAI.

The financing structure will see approximately half raised through equity-linked and common equity issuances, including mandatory convertible preferred securities and a new at-the-market equity program of up to $20 billion. The debt portion will be completed through a single investment-grade senior unsecured bond issuance early in 2026. Goldman Sachs will lead the bond offering, while Citigroup will lead the equity issuances.

Oracle's announcement underscores the massive capital requirements facing cloud infrastructure providers competing for AI workloads. Unlike hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that can largely self-fund expansion, Oracle is turning to capital markets to keep pace with contracted demand from its largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers. The raise represents one of the largest corporate capital raises in recent memory.

The company's stock has benefited from the AI infrastructure buildout, with Oracle positioning itself as a key player in providing the computing capacity needed for training and running large language models. The capital raise will fund new data centers, server procurement, and networking infrastructure. Analysts note that while the dilutive impact of equity issuance is a concern, Oracle's contracted backlog provides visibility into future revenue streams that justify the investment.

### 5. Nvidia-OpenAI $100 Billion Deal Stalls as Negotiations Go "On Ice"
*Feb 3*

> Five months after OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion deal, no contract has been signed and no money has changed hands, with Wall Street Journal reporting that negotiations are "on ice" after Nvidia executives expressed doubts about OpenAI's business model and lack of business discipline.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has told industry associates that the investment was "nonbinding and not finalized," while criticizing what he characterized as insufficient discipline in OpenAI's business strategy. Huang also shared concerns about competition from firms like Google and Anthropic. Since the deal was announced, the relationship has become more complicated: Nvidia has invested in rival AI labs, while OpenAI struck a $10 billion deal with chip startup Cerebras and has pursued partnerships with AMD and Broadcom for custom AI chips.

Huang publicly denied reports that he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling such characterizations "nonsense" and stating: "We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time." However, analysts suggest any eventual investment will likely be in the $20-30 billion range rather than the originally announced $100 billion.

The stalled negotiations highlight the evolving dynamics in the AI industry, where the largest players are increasingly hedging their bets across multiple partnerships and technologies. Nvidia's dominant position in AI chips gives it leverage in these negotiations, while OpenAI's need for computing capacity to train next-generation models creates pressure to secure supply from multiple sources. The ultimate resolution of these talks will signal how the AI ecosystem's major players are aligning for the next phase of competition.

### 6. Uber Falls 5% Despite Record Quarter as Guidance Disappoints
*Feb 5*

> Uber shares dropped 5.2% after the company reported record Q4 results including 3.6 billion trips and 200 million monthly active users, but issued Q1 2026 guidance below Wall Street's aggressive targets for both mobility and delivery segments.

The company reported Q4 revenue of $14.37 billion, a 20% year-over-year increase, but adjusted EPS of $0.71 missed the analyst consensus of $0.80 by nearly 11%. The shortfall was largely attributed to a $1.6 billion pre-tax headwind from equity investment revaluations and rising operational costs. For Q1 2026, Uber projected adjusted EBITDA and bookings below expectations, suggesting a sequential slowdown in demand.

Lyft shares fell 3.1% in sympathy with Uber's decline, with the rival ride-hailing company scheduled to report its own Q4 results on February 10. The weak guidance from Uber raises questions about the broader on-demand economy's trajectory as consumers face persistent inflation pressures. Both companies have been expanding into new verticals including autonomous vehicles, grocery delivery, and advertising.

Despite the guidance concerns, Uber announced plans to expand autonomous vehicle trips to up to 15 cities by year-end, including Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Munich, Hong Kong, Zurich, and Madrid. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi stated that by 2029, Uber intends to be the world's largest facilitator of autonomous vehicle trips. The company's AV strategy — partnering with technology companies rather than building its own self-driving systems — positions it to benefit regardless of which autonomous technology ultimately prevails.

### 7. ECB and Bank of England Hold Rates Steady Amid Growth and Inflation Uncertainty
*Feb 5*

> The European Central Bank held interest rates unchanged at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, while the Bank of England voted 5-4 to maintain rates at 3.75% in a closer-than-expected decision that signals internal divisions over the pace of monetary easing.

The ECB commented that inflation trajectory and economic conditions did not warrant a move, but warned the outlook was "unpredictable" given tariff threats and currency volatility. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the rest of 2026, with ECB President Lagarde playing down concerns about the euro's recent rally. The updated assessment confirms that inflation should stabilize at the 2% target in the medium term.

The Bank of England's decision was notably closer than expected, with four members voting to cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.5% versus forecasts of a 7-2 hold. The narrow margin demonstrates building pressure for rate cuts despite inflation remaining above target. Pay growth and services price inflation have generally continued to ease, reflecting the impact of monetary policy and evidence of subdued economic growth.

Both central banks face challenging balancing acts as they navigate persistent inflation pressures against slowing growth and external risks from potential U.S. tariffs. UK borrowing costs have come under pressure amid the Mandelson political crisis, while eurozone economies grapple with weak manufacturing and uncertain trade policy. Economists expect the Bank of England could begin cutting as early as March or April if economic data weakens further.

### 8. ARM Holdings Beats Estimates as Chip Designer Posts Fourth Consecutive Billion-Dollar Quarter
*Feb 5*

> ARM Holdings reported Q3 fiscal 2026 earnings of $0.43 per share, beating the $0.41 consensus, with revenue rising 26% to $1.24 billion as the chip designer extends its record-breaking momentum driven by AI-related demand for its processor architectures.

License revenue rose 25% to $505 million while royalty revenue increased 27% to $737 million, driven by higher royalty rates for newer products like Armv9 and Arm compute subsystems. The company provided strong Q4 guidance with EPS of $0.54-0.62 (versus consensus of $0.49) and revenue of $1.4-1.5 billion (above the $1.4 billion consensus), marking what would be its ninth consecutive earnings beat.

ARM shares initially traded lower following the after-hours report before recovering during the regular session the next day. The volatile reaction reflects the heightened scrutiny facing semiconductor stocks amid the broader tech selloff, even when companies deliver strong results. ARM's business model — licensing chip designs rather than manufacturing them — provides exposure to virtually every segment of the semiconductor market.

The company benefits from the proliferation of AI across devices from data centers to smartphones, with its power-efficient architectures increasingly favored for AI inference workloads. ARM's customer base includes nearly every major technology company, providing diversified exposure to the AI buildout. Analysts note that ARM's royalty rate increases on newer chip designs could drive continued revenue growth even if unit shipments stabilize.

### 9. Philip Morris Reports Record Year as Smoke-Free Products Reach 41.5% of Sales
*Feb 6*

> Philip Morris International reported full-year 2025 results with net revenue reaching $40.6 billion and smoke-free products rising to 41.5% of total sales, while guiding for 11-13% EPS growth in 2026 and setting new three-year targets for revenue and operating income growth.

Q4 results came in line with expectations, with adjusted diluted EPS of $7.54 for the full year representing growth of 14.8% versus 2024. The company's transformation away from traditional cigarettes continues to accelerate, with smoke-free products now comprising more than $17 billion of annual revenue. PMI set 2026-2028 compound annual growth targets of 6-8% for net revenues on an organic basis and 9-11% for adjusted diluted EPS.

The company described 2025 as "another remarkable year of results" with a fifth consecutive year of volume growth and strong operating margin expansion. Shares traded down 1.4% to $179.50 following the release, with investors having largely priced in the strong performance. The 2026 guidance suggests continued momentum in the company's pivot toward reduced-risk products including heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.

PMI's transformation story contrasts with challenges facing traditional tobacco companies as smoking rates decline in developed markets. The company's IQOS heated tobacco system and ZYN nicotine pouches have emerged as significant growth drivers. However, management warned of global pricing declines in the low- to mid-teens percentage range driven by its deal with the Trump administration, new direct-to-consumer pricing, and lower Medicaid pricing on older products.

### 10. KOSPI Triggers Three Circuit Breakers in Five Sessions as Korean Markets Whipsaw
*Feb 6*

> South Korea's stock market experienced one of its most volatile weeks in recent memory, with three program-trading halts triggered in five sessions as the KOSPI swung between daily drops of over 5% and rallies of nearly 7%, testing investor resolve during the global tech selloff.

The circuit breaker mechanism — triggered when KOSPI 200 futures move more than 5% from the previous day's close within a single minute — activated repeatedly as global tech concerns cascaded through Asian markets. On Monday, the Kospi fell 5.26% in a single session, triggering a brief halt and breaking below the 5,000 level. A day later it surged 6.84%, forcing another halt. Friday saw a third sidecar activation as panic selling briefly sent the index below 4,900.

Retail investors provided crucial support during the volatility, stepping in to buy during the sharpest selloffs and keeping the benchmark above 5,000 by Friday's close. The Korean market's sensitivity to tech sector sentiment reflects its heavy weighting toward semiconductor and electronics companies, particularly Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, which are exposed to global AI-related demand fluctuations.

The extreme volatility highlights how concentrated bets on AI-related themes have created fragile market conditions that can unwind rapidly when sentiment shifts. Korean shares led the emerging market selloff, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index posting its steepest weekly decline since November. Analysts note that while fundamental valuations have become more attractive, technical damage from the volatility may take time to repair.
