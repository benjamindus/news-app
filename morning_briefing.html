<h3>1. NATO Secretary General Rutte Visits Kyiv, Pledges $15 Billion for Ukrainian Weapons</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday, addressing Ukraine&#39;s parliament, visiting a bombed heating plant, and pledging to find over $15 billion to purchase weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rutte arrived in Kyiv just hours after Russia launched approximately 450 drones and 71 missiles at Ukrainian energy infrastructure — what President Zelenskyy called the most extensive energy strike of 2026. The NATO chief visited a civilian heating plant struck by Russian missiles alongside Ukraine&#39;s energy and foreign affairs ministers before holding bilateral meetings with Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, and senior defense officials. In his address to the Verkhovna Rada, Rutte said Putin was &quot;gravely mistaken&quot; to believe Ukraine was weak or that allied support would falter, declaring that Russian attacks &quot;do not signal Moscow is serious about peace.&quot;</p>
<p>Rutte outlined three layers of security guarantees currently under negotiation. The first is a strengthened Ukrainian army funded by partners as the &quot;first line of defence.&quot; Combined, the three levels aim to ensure that &quot;for Russia to attack again will be a very bad decision.&quot; He said the guarantees were &quot;90 percent&quot; agreed upon and pledged to find more than $15 billion to purchase weapons for Ukraine. NATO has already supplied around 75 percent of Ukraine&#39;s Patriot missiles and 90 percent of missiles used in other air defense systems through the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List.</p>
<p>The visit comes at a pivotal moment. Trilateral peace talks involving U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian representatives are scheduled to resume in the United Arab Emirates this week, and Rutte also mentioned that foreign troops would be deployed to Ukraine &quot;immediately after the conclusion of a peace agreement.&quot; Russia&#39;s Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security responded by warning against the deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, accused Russia of exploiting the proposed energy ceasefire to stockpile missiles for winter strikes.</p>

<h3>2. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Assassinated in Libya</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the most prominent son of late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and once seen as his heir-apparent, was shot dead by four armed men at his residence in Zintan, southwest of Tripoli.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assailants stormed Saif al-Islam&#39;s residence after disabling surveillance cameras and executed him in his garden before fleeing, according to his political adviser Abdurrahim. Libya&#39;s attorney general&#39;s office confirmed his death from gunshot wounds after investigators and forensic doctors examined the body. His political team described the killing as a &quot;cowardly and treacherous assassination.&quot; The 53-year-old had been based in Zintan since 2011 — first as a prisoner, then as a free man plotting his political return after his release in 2017.</p>
<p>Some reports linked the killing to clashes with the 444th Brigade, a prominent Tripoli-based militia, though the group denied involvement. Conflicting accounts emerged about the exact location — some family members suggested he died near the Algerian border, but the majority of sources place the incident in Zintan. No arrests have been announced as authorities continue their investigation. Saif al-Islam had been wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity related to the 2011 uprising.</p>
<p>Libya expert Emadeddin Badi said the killing was &quot;likely to cast him as a martyr for a significant segment of the population, while also shifting electoral dynamics by removing a major obstacle to presidential elections.&quot; Saif al-Islam had maintained a following among loyalists of the former regime and had announced his candidacy for presidential elections that have been repeatedly delayed. Libya remains divided between a UN-backed government in Tripoli and an eastern administration backed by Khalifa Haftar, and has struggled to hold elections since the NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>

<h3>3. Trump and Colombia&#39;s Petro Hold Surprise Cordial Meeting at White House</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump hosted Colombian President Gustavo Petro at the White House for a two-hour closed-door meeting that defused months of escalating tensions, with Petro emerging with a personalized MAGA hat altered to read &quot;Make Americas Great Again.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meeting — the first in-person encounter between the two leaders — came exactly one month after the U.S. military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Trump had previously labeled Petro a &quot;drug leader&quot; without evidence and suggested he could meet a similar fate to Maduro. Secretary of State Marco Rubio granted Petro a temporary U.S. entry authorization for the visit after his visa had been revoked. Senator Rand Paul helped facilitate a phone call between the leaders in late January that set the meeting in motion.</p>
<p>The tone proved strikingly warm. &quot;We got along very well,&quot; Trump told reporters afterward. Petro said Trump told him &quot;I like you&quot; and described the interaction as &quot;a meeting between two equals who have different ways of thinking.&quot; The Colombian president posted photos on social media showing a signed copy of Trump&#39;s &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot; inscribed &quot;You are great,&quot; and a note reading &quot;Gustavo — a great honor. I love Colombia.&quot; Petro proposed adding an &quot;S&quot; to Trump&#39;s signature slogan — &quot;Make Americas Great Again&quot; — and said the president appeared to like the idea.</p>
<p>The leaders discussed counternarcotics cooperation, with Colombia being the world&#39;s top coca producer. Petro said they specifically discussed bolstering border economies near Venezuela and Ecuador to fight drug flows. The meeting was attended by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Rubio, and Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, who was born in Colombia. While no joint press conference was held and significant policy differences remain — including on sanctions and immigration — the meeting represents a notable de-escalation from the threats and insults that defined the relationship throughout 2025.</p>

<h3>4. Iran Protest Death Toll Surpasses 6,400 as Brutal Crackdown Continues</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The verified death toll from Iran&#39;s ongoing protest crackdown has risen to 6,425 adult protesters, 146 minors, and 57 non-participants, according to the human rights group HRANA, while doctors inside Iran estimate the true figure could be 20,000 to 30,000 or higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The protests erupted on December 28, 2025, fueled by economic freefall and the rial&#39;s loss of more than 40 percent of its value since Israel&#39;s 12-day conflict with Iran in June. On January 8, security forces launched what observers described as &quot;Iran&#39;s Babi Yar&quot; — the deadliest incident of repression since the Islamic Republic took power in 1979. Supreme Leader Khamenei ordered forces to &quot;crush the protests by any means necessary&quot; and later acknowledged &quot;thousands of people&quot; had been killed, blaming President Trump for the violence. Internal Ministry of Health estimates indicated at least 30,000 people were killed in the first 48 hours of the crackdown alone.</p>
<p>The situation on the ground remains dire. Patrols and checkpoints are ubiquitous across urban centers, with increased police and military deployments. In Tehran, daily life has slowed markedly, with many shops closed and streets described as operating under &quot;a de facto curfew.&quot; Four current Iranian officials told Reuters that public anger has reached a point where &quot;fear is no longer a deterrent,&quot; and that a U.S. strike combined with continued protests could cause the regime to collapse. In a significant development, Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi reportedly sent a personal message to U.S. Special Envoy Witkoff stating that Iran had canceled the planned execution of 800 anti-regime protesters.</p>
<p>The international response has intensified. The UK announced sweeping sanctions designating ten individuals and one organization involved in enabling brutality. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz characterized the crackdown as a &quot;sign of weakness,&quot; asserting the regime was in its &quot;final days.&quot; Amnesty International called for &quot;global diplomatic action.&quot; Meanwhile, the U.S. has deployed an aircraft carrier group and fighter jets to the Middle East in its most significant military buildup in the region since operations preceding strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in mid-2025, pairing the force movements with demands that Iran stop killing protesters and not restart its nuclear program.</p>

<h3>5. ICE Immigration Crackdown Targets Refugees and Children in Minnesota</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 100 refugees with no criminal background have been arrested in Minnesota under the Trump administration&#39;s &quot;Operation Metro Surge,&quot; with many flown to detention in Texas, while the detention of a five-year-old boy sparked national outrage and a federal court rebuke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security announced the operation on January 9 to reexamine thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, focusing on those who arrived in recent years and have not yet received green cards. Adrian Conejo Arias and his five-year-old son Liam were apprehended by ICE in January, producing a viral photograph that became a symbol of the expanding crackdown. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ordered their release and lambasted the administration&#39;s &quot;ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas.&quot;</p>
<p>Another federal judge, John Tunheim, ordered the release of detained refugees and granted a temporary pause in detentions, writing: &quot;At its best, America serves as a haven of individual liberties in a world too often full of tyranny and cruelty. We abandon that ideal when we subject our neighbors to fear and chaos.&quot; Immigration attorneys argued DHS was relying on an arcane statute allowing detention of people with pending green card applications as a pretext to search for fraud. Jane Graupman of the International Institute of Minnesota called the treatment &quot;un-American,&quot; noting that &quot;refugees are probably the most vetted population that comes to the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>The Minnesota operations have had ripple effects across communities. School districts report high absentee rates and increased virtual schooling as fear spreads among immigrant families. Two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis have drawn scrutiny. Many refugees detained and later released in Texas were left on the streets with no money, documents, or way to return home. Nationally, ICE detention has surged 75 percent to more than 70,000, the highest level ever recorded, while arrests of people with no criminal record increased 2,450 percent in the administration&#39;s first year. Governor Tim Walz has written to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requesting information on detained children.</p>

<h3>6. Sudan Army Breaks RSF Siege of Kadugli as Government Returns to Khartoum</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sudan&#39;s military announced it has broken through the Rapid Support Forces&#39; siege of Kadugli, the South Kordofan capital where the UN confirmed famine last year, marking its second major advance in less than a week as the government consolidates its return to Khartoum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The breakthrough at Kadugli follows the government&#39;s official return to Khartoum in January after nearly three years of operating from the Red Sea city of Port Sudan. Khartoum International Airport received its first scheduled commercial flight in over two years on February 1 — a Sudan Airways flight from Port Sudan carrying dozens of passengers — with officials saying the facility can now handle up to four flights daily. More than 12 million people have been displaced since the civil war erupted in April 2023 between the army and the RSF, including nearly 4 million who fled to neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Police in Khartoum have arrested 500 people for impersonating security forces and shut down 40 illegal offices as part of a broader effort to assert state authority, collect illegal weapons, and dismantle irregular armed groups. The city has seen a steady daily return of displaced residents and a resurgence of commercial activity since the military regained control in March 2025. However, more than 70 percent of Sudan&#39;s hospitals have been destroyed, and UN officials estimate that rehabilitating the capital&#39;s essential infrastructure will cost $350 million.</p>
<p>A New York Times investigation revealed the existence of a secret airbase in Egypt&#39;s Western Desert allegedly used to launch Turkish-made drones at targets in Sudan, representing a shift from Egypt&#39;s previous diplomatic role to active military support for the Sudanese army. The government has declared 2026 &quot;the Year of Peace&quot; under a National Peace Initiative, but fighting continues in multiple regions. The UN Security Council is expected to receive a 120-day briefing on Sudan in February, with the UK — holding the Council&#39;s rotating presidency — planning to elevate the session to ministerial level.</p>

<h3>7. Europe Confronts Strategic Autonomy Crisis as Washington Shifts Defense Posture</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2026 U.S. National Defense Strategy explicitly reframes American support for European defense as contingent on burden-sharing, stating that European allies are &quot;expected to take the lead in the conventional defense of Europe&quot; with America providing only critical enablers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strategic shift has accelerated Europe&#39;s most ambitious defense buildup since the Cold War. The EU&#39;s &quot;ReArm Europe&quot; plan, endorsed by leaders in March 2025, outlines up to €800 billion in additional defense spending through 2030, with two pillars: a fiscal escape clause allowing member states to increase military budgets by up to 1.5 percent of GDP outside deficit rules (generating an estimated €650 billion), and a €150 billion loan instrument called SAFE for investment in missile defense, drones, and cybersecurity. Nineteen member states have fully subscribed to the SAFE loans.</p>
<p>Germany is leading the charge, allocating €82.69 billion for the Bundeswehr in its 2026 budget — about 15 percent of total federal spending — with plans to lift defense spending to nearly 3.5 percent of GDP by 2029. European defense budgets are rising approximately 13 percent year-on-year. At NATO&#39;s July summit, allies agreed to Trump&#39;s demand for 5 percent of GDP in combined defense and security spending by 2035. However, NATO Secretary General Rutte himself warned against European overconfidence: &quot;If you really want to go it alone, forget that you can ever get there with 5 percent. It will be 10 percent. You have to build up your own nuclear capability.&quot;</p>
<p>Critical vulnerabilities persist. China controls 90 percent of the world&#39;s rare-earth magnets and supplies 98 percent of what Europe imports — materials essential for drone motors, missile guidance systems, and other military equipment. Beijing&#39;s recent export restrictions on these materials compound the challenge. European manufacturers must find 600,000 skilled defense industry workers by 2030, with 200,000 needed by 2026. Analysts warn that without accelerated force integration and industrial consolidation, Europe risks &quot;mistaking motion for momentum&quot; — spending more without becoming strategically capable.</p>

<h3>8. North Korea Launches Ballistic Missiles as Korean Peninsula Tensions Escalate</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 27</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters on January 27, the second such test that month, as the regime heightens tensions ahead of a major Workers&#39; Party congress and the Council on Foreign Relations elevates the Korean Peninsula to its top tier of global conflict risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The missiles were launched from an area northeast of Pyongyang and flew approximately 350 kilometers each. Japan condemned the launches as violations of UN Security Council resolutions and lodged a formal protest with North Korea. The tests followed an earlier volley on January 4, timed to coincide with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung&#39;s state visit to China. Pyongyang said its earlier January launches involved hypersonic missiles that successfully hit targets 1,000 kilometers away, signaling continued advances in weapons technology.</p>
<p>The 2026 U.S. National Defense Strategy has intensified uncertainty on the peninsula. While acknowledging the DPRK as a &quot;direct military threat,&quot; it asserts that South Korea is &quot;capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support&quot; — a significant departure from the posture of previous administrations. The 2025 National Security Strategy notably omitted any reference to denuclearizing North Korea for the first time since the DPRK withdrew from the NPT in 2003, fueling speculation that Trump may seek a diplomatic accommodation. Kim Jong Un has made clear he will refuse negotiations unless the U.S. abandons its &quot;obsession with denuclearization.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korean President Lee asked Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to play a mediation role, proposing a freeze on Pyongyang&#39;s nuclear program in exchange for &quot;compensation or some form of return.&quot; However, prospects for diplomacy remain dim. North Korea has also accused South Korea of sending surveillance drones into its airspace on at least two occasions since September 2025, warning Seoul would &quot;never be able to evade responsibility.&quot; At the UN Security Council, China and Russia continue to block responses to missile launches and have called for sanctions to be eased.</p>

<h3>9. Crans-Montana Bar Fire Death Toll Reaches 41 as Criminal Investigation Deepens</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The death toll from the New Year&#39;s Eve fire at Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana has risen to 41 — including an 18-year-old Swiss national — as prosecutors investigate the bar&#39;s owners for negligent homicide and multiple safety failures emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fire broke out at approximately 1:30 a.m. on January 1 during a packed New Year&#39;s celebration, killing 40 people initially and injuring 119 others. More than half of those killed were teenagers. Swiss authorities believe the blaze was ignited when lit sparklers attached to champagne bottles set fire to the bar&#39;s soundproofing insulation, which owner Jacques Moretti told prosecutors he had purchased from a do-it-yourself store and installed himself without authorization. The fire spread with extraordinary speed, likely developing into a flashover that engulfed the interior within seconds.</p>
<p>The investigation has revealed systemic safety failures. No fire checks had taken place at Le Constellation since 2019. Former employees claimed fire extinguishers were locked in a storage room. The basement bar had no sprinkler system. Social media images from renovation work suggest the staircase connecting the basement to ground level was narrowed, creating a fatal bottleneck. Surveillance footage from the bar&#39;s own cameras is unavailable, and by the time prosecutors requested video from 250 public cameras in the village, the files had already been deleted under a seven-day retention policy.</p>
<p>The disaster has prompted a broader reckoning with Swiss fire safety regulation. Valais is one of the few Swiss cantons that does not legally require building insurance — the mechanism through which other cantons conduct fire inspections. Of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected during 2025 despite annual inspections being required. The municipal council imposed an immediate ban on pyrotechnic devices in enclosed areas and commissioned an external firm to inspect all public establishments. Switzerland&#39;s intercantonal fire safety standards authority halted an ongoing liberalization of safety rules pending the investigation results.</p>

<h3>10. Rome Introduces Trevi Fountain Tourist Fee to Combat Overtourism</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Foreign visitors must now pay €2 ($2.35) to access Rome&#39;s Trevi Fountain up close, as Italy&#39;s capital becomes the latest European city to impose entry fees on crowded heritage sites in an effort to manage tourist flows and fund preservation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fee, which took effect February 2, applies from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. most days, with free access after hours. Tickets can be purchased online or via QR codes at the site. Children under five, people with disabilities, and Rome residents are exempt. The fountain still can be viewed from a distance for free, but closer access requires a ticket. Officials estimate the measure will generate €6.5 million ($7.6 million) per year. The famous coins tossed into the fountain — approximately €1.5 million annually — will continue to be donated to the Catholic charity Caritas.</p>
<p>The Trevi Fountain draws an estimated 30,000 visitors daily, with peak days reaching 70,000, totaling more than 9 million visitors annually. Tourism Assessor Alessandro Onorato said tourists were &quot;shocked by the fact that the city of Rome is only asking for 2 euros for a site of this level.&quot; On the first day, a group of Spanish tourists refused to pay and stood outside the barriers, flinging coins toward the fountain from above — several missing the water entirely.</p>
<p>The fee was rolled out alongside a new €5 tourist ticket (the Roma Mic card) for select civic museums including the Napoleonic Museum and the Giovanni Barracco Museum of Ancient Sculpture. It follows a growing trend of Italian measures targeting overtourism — Venice introduced a peak-time entry fee for day trippers in 2024 — and mirrors broader European efforts to balance tourism revenue with quality of life for residents and preservation of cultural heritage. Rome attracted a record 50 million tourists in 2025, straining infrastructure and local services in the historic center.</p>

<h3>1. Eli Lilly Blows Past Estimates on Surging Zepbound and Mounjaro Demand</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly reported Q4 revenue of $19.3 billion, up 43% year-over-year, and issued 2026 guidance of $80–$83 billion in revenue — well above the $77.6 billion consensus — driven by explosive demand for weight-loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adjusted earnings came in at $7.54 per share, crushing the $6.67 consensus estimate. Mounjaro generated $7.41 billion in Q4 revenue versus $6.63 billion expected, while Zepbound posted $4.3 billion against estimates of $3.41 billion. For the full year, Mounjaro sales grew 99 percent to $22.97 billion and Zepbound surged 175 percent to $13.54 billion. The company also guided adjusted earnings of $33.50 to $35.00 per share for 2026, above the $33.23 consensus.</p>
<p>CEO Dave Ricks told CNBC he expects upcoming government Medicare coverage of obesity treatments to expand the U.S. market this year, calling it &quot;a big multiplier on the eligible pool&quot; of patients. Lilly also expects to launch a GLP-1 pill for obesity in Q2, pending U.S. approval, which would add a significant new revenue stream. However, the company warned of a global pricing decline in the low- to mid-teens percentage range, driven by its deal with the Trump administration, new direct-to-consumer Zepbound rates, and lower Medicaid pricing on older products.</p>
<p>The results stand in stark contrast to rival Novo Nordisk, which warned the same week that it expects sales and profit to decline as much as 13 percent in 2026 amid intensifying competition and pricing pressure. Shares of Eli Lilly rose over 7 percent in premarket trading to $1,092 from Tuesday&#39;s close of $1,003. The divergence between the two GLP-1 leaders is becoming a defining narrative in pharmaceuticals, with Lilly&#39;s broader pipeline and aggressive capacity expansion giving it an increasingly clear competitive advantage.</p>

<h3>2. AMD Drops 9% Despite Earnings Beat as AI Guidance Disappoints</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices fell 9% in premarket trading after its first-quarter forecast failed to match elevated expectations for AI-driven growth, dragging Broadcom, Micron, and other semiconductor names lower despite AMD posting Q4 earnings of $1.53 per share on $10.27 billion in revenue — both above consensus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD guided first-quarter revenue of $9.8 billion, above the $9.38 billion consensus but below the $10 billion-plus that some bullish analysts had projected given the massive AI infrastructure buildout by hyperscalers. Net income climbed to $1.51 billion from $482 million a year ago. However, a significant portion of Q4 data center revenue came from $390 million in China-bound AI chip sales approved under a U.S. license — without which the segment would have missed estimates.</p>
<p>CEO Lisa Su said AMD was in &quot;active discussions&quot; for additional sales of its next-generation MI450 chip, with the ramp &quot;on schedule to start in the second half of the year.&quot; The company&#39;s October deal with OpenAI, which could see the startup take a 10 percent stake in AMD and deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs, remains a key catalyst for the second half of 2026. However, Goldman Sachs maintained a neutral rating, citing &quot;limited near-term operating leverage&quot; given AMD&#39;s heavy software and systems investments.</p>
<p>The reaction reflects a broader challenge facing semiconductor companies outside of Nvidia: even strong results are being punished when guidance falls short of the market&#39;s most optimistic AI scenarios. Deutsche Bank maintained a hold rating, noting investors are &quot;likely to be disappointed from the outsized impact of China GPU revenues&quot; but sees the second half of 2026 as AMD&#39;s inflection point. Barclays maintained an overweight rating with a $300 target, implying 24 percent upside from current levels.</p>

<h3>3. Uber Reports Record Bookings and Plans Robotaxi Expansion to 15 Cities</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uber reported Q4 gross bookings of $54.1 billion, topping the $53.1 billion estimate, with revenue of $14.37 billion and record quarterly GAAP operating income of $1.8 billion, while announcing plans to facilitate autonomous vehicle trips in up to 15 cities by year-end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mobility revenue rose 19 percent year-over-year to $8.2 billion, while delivery revenue climbed 30 percent to $4.9 billion. Quarterly trips grew 22 percent to more than 40 million per day, with the platform surpassing 200 million monthly active users. Full-year 2025 results included $193 billion in gross bookings and $10 billion in free cash flow. Net income of $296 million was depressed by a $1.6 billion pretax headwind from equity investment revaluations.</p>
<p>For Q1 2026, Uber guided gross bookings of $52.0–$53.5 billion, representing 17–21 percent constant-currency growth, and Non-GAAP EPS of $0.65–$0.72, representing 37 percent growth at the midpoint. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi emphasized the autonomous vehicle roadmap, with plans to expand to Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Munich, Hong Kong, Zurich, and Madrid. By 2029, Uber intends to be the world&#39;s largest facilitator of autonomous vehicle trips.</p>
<p>Shares initially fell after the report but rose 3 percent during the analyst call as management detailed autonomous vehicle progress. Uber&#39;s AV strategy — partnering with companies like Waymo rather than building its own technology — positions it as the dominant ride-hailing aggregator regardless of which self-driving technology prevails. The delivery segment&#39;s 30 percent growth rate was a particular bright spot, driven by grocery and retail expansion beyond restaurant food delivery.</p>

<h3>4. Chipotle Sinks on Fourth Straight Quarter of Declining Restaurant Traffic</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chipotle shares tumbled as much as 11% after the fast-casual chain reported that customer traffic fell 3.2% in Q4 — the fourth consecutive quarterly decline — and projected flat same-store sales growth for 2026, below the 1.8% increase analysts had expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparable restaurant sales fell 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, driven by the 3.2 percent drop in transactions partially offset by a 0.7 percent increase in average check from higher menu prices. For the full year, Chipotle posted its first annual same-store sales decline since 2016, down 1.7 percent, even as total revenue climbed 5.4 percent to $11.9 billion from new store openings and price increases. Excluding impairment costs, Chipotle earned 25 cents per share on net sales of $2.98 billion.</p>
<p>Executives acknowledged a pullback in spending from consumers across all income levels, with low-income diners making the most significant behavioral shift. Traffic among lower- to middle-income consumers and the 25–35 age cohort has dropped meaningfully. Management said it does not plan to fully offset mid-single-digit food inflation in 2026, accepting near-term margin pressure to reinforce its value positioning rather than pricing out cost-conscious customers.</p>
<p>The stock has now fallen approximately 33 percent over the past year, dragging the company&#39;s market value to about $51 billion. Chipotle plans to open 350–370 new restaurants in 2026, including 10–15 international locations. Analysts point to the launch of a high-protein menu including snack-ready protein cups and the return of chicken al pastor — described as its most-requested limited-time item — as potential catalysts to reverse the traffic decline. However, the broader environment for casual and fast-casual dining remains challenged as consumers tighten budgets amid persistent inflation.</p>

<h3>5. ADP Report Shows Private Hiring Slumped to Just 22,000 Jobs in January</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private-sector employers added only 22,000 positions in January — less than half the 45,000 forecast — and the total would have been negative without a surge of 74,000 hires in education and health services, according to the ADP employment report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report starts 2026 on the same lackluster note as 2025 ended: a low-hire, low-fire environment that may fuel concerns among Federal Reserve policymakers that more support is needed. The January total was below the downwardly revised 37,000 increase in December. Leading the slowdown was manufacturing, which has lost jobs every month since March 2024, along with professional and business services and large employers. Pay growth for job-stayers held steady at 4.5 percent year-over-year, while job-changers saw annualized pay growth slow to 6.4 percent from 6.6 percent.</p>
<p>The report arrives during a data vacuum created by the partial government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has postponed the official January Employment Situation report — typically the most closely watched economic indicator — indefinitely. Its absence deprives the Federal Reserve, investors, and policymakers of a critical data point during a period of extreme market volatility across precious metals, tech stocks, and crypto. Treasury yields were little changed following the report, with the 10-year yield holding near 4.27 percent.</p>
<p>Outside of education and health care, the only sectors showing meaningful job creation were financial activities (14,000), construction (9,000), and trade, transportation, and utilities along with leisure and hospitality (4,000 each). The weakness in hiring, combined with the missing jobs report and the nomination of inflation hawk Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair, creates an unusually opaque environment for gauging the health of the U.S. labor market.</p>

<h3>6. Software Sector Enters Bear Market as AI Disruption Fears Intensify</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has fallen 20% year-to-date — entering technical bear market territory — as investors dump application-layer software stocks on growing fears that AI tools like Anthropic&#39;s Claude Code are fundamentally disrupting business models across the industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff has been indiscriminate. HubSpot, ServiceTitan, ServiceNow, Atlassian, DocuSign, Salesforce, Workday, and Adobe have all hit fresh 52-week lows. Even companies that beat estimates are being punished: ServiceNow topped expectations on every metric with 20.5 percent revenue growth, yet fell nearly 10 percent. Microsoft beat on Azure&#39;s 39 percent cloud growth and still dropped 10 percent. Software sentiment is &quot;the worst ever,&quot; according to Jefferies, and &quot;radioactive&quot; per Bloomberg Intelligence.</p>
<p>The contagion has spread beyond software into private credit. UBS analysts estimate 25–35 percent of the private credit market is exposed to AI disruption risk. Blue Owl, TPG, Ares Management, and KKR all fell by double-digit percentages, while Apollo Global dropped 7 percent and BlackRock shed 5 percent. About 70 percent of software providers now admit that the cost of delivering AI features is eating into profitability, challenging the era of &quot;infinite margins&quot; for SaaS companies. Macro strategist Andreas Steno Larsen declared &quot;software is dead.&quot;</p>
<p>The iShares Software ETF has recorded a &quot;death cross&quot; — its 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day — and year-to-date, the VanEck Oil Services ETF has outperformed it by more than 50 percentage points. However, some fund managers see opportunity. Microsoft now trades at about 23 times estimated earnings, near its lowest multiple in three years, with technical indicators showing oversold conditions. Palantir remains a rare bright spot in the sector, closing up 7 percent on strong earnings even as the broader software ETF plunged 5 percent on the same day.</p>

<h3>7. Dow Touches Record High Before Reversing on Tech Rotation</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly touched a new all-time intraday high of 49,653 before reversing to close down 0.34% at 49,241, as a dramatic rotation out of technology stocks lifted economically sensitive sectors while dragging the Nasdaq down 1.43%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The split market reflected a deepening divergence between old-economy winners and tech losers. The Dow&#39;s gains were led by Verizon (+3.6%), Cisco Systems (+3.1%), and Walmart (+3.0%), while Salesforce (-7.0%), IBM (-6.3%), and Microsoft (-2.9%) weighed on the index. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.84 percent to 6,917.81. The session came a day after the Dow surged 515 points on strong manufacturing data and trade optimism, underscoring the volatility gripping markets during earnings season.</p>
<p>Most &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; mega-cap names were in the red, with Nvidia slumping nearly 3 percent, Meta and Microsoft both falling more than 2 percent, and Apple marginally lower. The rotation reflected a repricing of the tech ecosystem as investors distinguish between AI enablers and companies whose business models are threatened by AI disruption. While AI hardware and select semiconductor names held up, application-layer software companies bore the brunt of selling pressure.</p>
<p>The broader backdrop includes the government shutdown, precious metals turmoil, a pending Alphabet earnings report after the close, and the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair, which has reset expectations for monetary policy. With the January jobs report delayed indefinitely and ADP showing only 22,000 private-sector jobs added, investors face limited visibility into economic conditions. Economically sensitive small-cap stocks in the Russell 2000 outperformed, extending a pattern that began in January as the &quot;Great Rotation&quot; thesis gains momentum.</p>

<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 8 percentage points in the first five weeks of 2026, surging nearly 8% as capital flows out of mega-cap tech and into domestically focused small-cap stocks in what Wall Street is calling the &quot;Great Rotation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rotation began in early January after economic data confirmed a &quot;Goldilocks&quot; scenario of cooling inflation without recession. The Russell 2000 posted a 13-session winning streak relative to the S&amp;P 500, outperforming by an average of 45 basis points per day — tying a record set in 2008. The valuation gap driving the move reached a 25-year extreme by end of 2025, with the Russell 2000 trading at roughly 18 times forward earnings versus the S&amp;P 500 at 26 times.</p>
<p>Three structural factors underpin the rotation. First, the Federal Reserve&#39;s easing cycle has brought the target rate to 3.50–3.75 percent, providing critical relief for small-caps where nearly 50 percent of outstanding debt is floating-rate. Second, smaller companies are projected to see 30–35 percent earnings growth in 2026, significantly outpacing the 22 percent expected from the &quot;Magnificent Seven,&quot; creating an &quot;earnings handoff.&quot; Third, the political landscape&#39;s emphasis on &quot;America First&quot; industrial policy and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act&#39;s fiscal tailwinds disproportionately benefit smaller domestic companies, defense contractors, and regional banks.</p>
<p>Regional banks have led the charge, benefiting from a steepening yield curve and middle-market M&amp;A activity. Cyclicals including industrials, energy, and materials have been the biggest beneficiaries of the rotation. Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis set a year-end target of 2,825 for the Russell 2000, projecting 14 percent gains. However, risks remain: inflation is still above the Fed&#39;s 2 percent target, and the overall quality of small-cap stocks is lower, with unprofitable biotech and speculative tech subsectors potentially vulnerable to sharp reversals.</p>

<h3>9. U.S. Yield Curve Nears Widest Spread in Four Years Ahead of Treasury Auctions</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spread between 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields has widened to approximately 69 basis points, closing in on a four-year high of 74 basis points reached in April 2025, as the nomination of inflation hawk Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair reshapes the fixed-income landscape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 10-year yield held near 4.28 percent on Wednesday, little changed after initially dipping on the weak ADP employment report. Investors continue to price in two Fed rate cuts in 2026, likely in June and October, but the Warsh nomination has introduced significant uncertainty about the pace and extent of easing. Warsh, who opposed a larger Fed balance sheet during the 2008 financial crisis, is widely perceived as more hawkish than current Chair Jerome Powell, contributing to the curve steepening that has played out since late January.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said it now expects to borrow $574 billion in Q1, $3 billion less than projected in November, mainly reflecting a higher cash balance at the start of the quarter. Quarterly bond-sale plans due Wednesday will provide additional clues on future government issuance. Meanwhile, the partial government shutdown has created a data vacuum, with the January jobs report postponed indefinitely and today&#39;s ADP report showing only 22,000 private-sector jobs added — reinforcing the &quot;low-hire, low-fire&quot; labor market narrative.</p>
<p>The steepening curve has significant implications for the &quot;Great Rotation&quot; into small-cap stocks, as regional banks and other financials benefit from wider spreads between short- and long-term rates. Charles Schwab&#39;s 2026 outlook projects two to three Fed rate cuts amid steady economic growth and ongoing inflation pressures. The ISM manufacturing data this week showed an unexpected rebound in U.S. factory activity, adding to yields while complicating the case for aggressive rate cuts. Bond investors face a challenging environment where policy uncertainty, delayed data, and political factors around the Fed Chair nomination create unusually wide error bands for rate forecasts.</p>

<h3>10. Europe Launches €800 Billion ReArm Defense Spending Plan</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Commission&#39;s &quot;ReArm Europe / Readiness 2030&quot; plan has entered its implementation phase, with 19 member states subscribing to €150 billion in defense loans and 16 activating fiscal escape clauses that could generate €650 billion in additional military spending by 2030.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plan&#39;s two financial pillars represent the most ambitious European defense initiative since NATO&#39;s founding. The Stability and Growth Pact&#39;s escape clause allows countries to increase military budgets by up to 1.5 percent of GDP without the spending counting toward national deficit limits. The €150 billion SAFE loan instrument, adopted by the EU Council in May 2025, funds investment in missile defense, drones, and cybersecurity, with requirements favoring European manufacturers. The plan targets 55 percent of all military purchases from European factories by 2030, with joint procurement reaching 40 percent by 2027.</p>
<p>Germany has emerged as the leading spender, allocating €82.69 billion for the Bundeswehr in 2026 — approximately 15 percent of the total federal budget — with plans to reach nearly 3.5 percent of GDP by 2029, up from 2.1 percent in 2024. European defense budgets are rising approximately 13 percent year-on-year, with the EU-27 collectively surpassing the 2 percent GDP benchmark for the first time. Goldman Sachs projects the defense-driven fiscal push could support 1.3 percent GDP growth for the eurozone in 2026.</p>
<p>However, critical challenges threaten execution. European manufacturers must find 600,000 skilled defense industry workers by 2030, with 200,000 needed by 2026. China controls 90 percent of the world&#39;s rare-earth magnets and supplies 98 percent of Europe&#39;s imports of materials essential for drone motors, missile guidance systems, and other military equipment — and Beijing has recently imposed export restrictions on these critical inputs. Defense production has unusually long delivery cycles, with order books covering four to five years of output, meaning the impact on actual production and GDP growth will be gradual rather than immediate.</p>
