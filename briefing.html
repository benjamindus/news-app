<h3>1. Winter Olympics 2026 Opens with Historic Dual Cauldron Lighting in Milan and Cortina</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2026 Winter Olympics opened with a spectacular ceremony at Milan&#39;s San Siro stadium, marking the first time in Olympic history that two cauldrons were lit simultaneously — one in Milan at the Arco della Pace and another in Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo at Piazza Dibona.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over 2,900 athletes from 93 countries marched in the Parade of Nations as the Games officially began. The ceremony featured performances from Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli, Laura Pausini, and Italian rapper Ghali, along with world-renowned pianist Lang Lang. Actor Pierfrancesco Favino and The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore also participated in the festivities. The dual cauldron lighting represented the geographical spread of the Games across the Lombardy and Veneto regions.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony took place from 2 PM to 5 PM ET, with activations occurring simultaneously in Predazzo, Livigno, and Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo in addition to the main Milan venue. Greece led the Parade of Nations as the birthplace of the Olympics, followed by the other delegations in alphabetical order according to Italian. The event organizers emphasized the sustainable and innovative aspects of these Games, which span multiple competition venues across northern Italy.</p>
<p>Italy&#39;s first Winter Olympics since Turin 2006 comes amid significant global attention, with the ceremony broadcast to an estimated worldwide audience of over 1 billion viewers. Competition begins immediately in several sports including figure skating and ski jumping. The Games will run through February 22, featuring 116 medal events across 16 disciplines.</p>

<h3>2. Balochistan Attacks Kill Over 225 as Pakistan Launches Massive Counterterrorism Operation</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Army launched &quot;Operation Herof 2.0,&quot; a coordinated assault across at least nine districts of Pakistan&#39;s Balochistan province, triggering a 40-hour military response that left at least 225 dead including militants, security personnel, and civilians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attacks began around 3:00 AM local time on January 31, targeting police stations, paramilitary outposts, a high-security prison in Quetta, and civilian vehicles across Quetta, Gwadar, Mastung, Nushki, Pasni, and Kharan. Militants employed guns, grenades, and suicide vests in what Pakistani officials described as the most significant coordinated insurgent operation in years. BLA released videos showing female fighters participating in the attacks, labeling the operation a follow-up to their August 2024 offensive.</p>
<p>Pakistani military and police forces announced the conclusion of operations on February 5, claiming to have killed 145 BLA fighters while acknowledging the deaths of 17 security personnel and 31 civilians. The BLA disputed these figures, claiming to have killed 280 security personnel and captured 18 prisoners, though provided no evidence. Pakistan deployed helicopters and drones to end the standoff, with security operations extending across multiple remote districts of the restive province.</p>
<p>The attacks highlight the ongoing insurgency in Pakistan&#39;s largest but least populated province, where separatist groups have waged a decades-long campaign against the central government. The BLA, designated a terrorist organization by Pakistan, the UK, and the US, seeks independence for the ethnic Baloch people and has increasingly targeted Chinese interests in the region, including the strategic Gwadar port. The scale of the coordinated attacks represents a significant escalation in the conflict.</p>

<h3>3. Sudan Famine Spreads as Acute Malnutrition Reaches Crisis Levels in Darfur</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acute malnutrition has reached famine levels in two additional towns in Sudan&#39;s North Darfur region, with nearly 53% of children under five suffering from acute malnutrition in Um Baru — almost double the famine threshold — according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sudan now represents the world&#39;s largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions confirmed in Al Fasher and Kadugli and the risk of famine in 20 additional areas across Greater Darfur and Greater Kordofan. Nearly 4.2 million cases of acute malnutrition are expected in 2026, including more than 800,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition — a sharp increase from 2025 levels. The UN reports that hunger is expected to worsen from February as food stocks run out and fighting continues.</p>
<p>The humanitarian catastrophe stems from the civil war that erupted in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, which has displaced over 12 million people. In the western regions of Sudan — notably North Darfur, South Darfur, West Kordofan, and South Kordofan — conflict and severely restricted humanitarian access are driving the sharp deterioration. More than 70 percent of Sudan&#39;s hospitals have been destroyed, and UN officials estimate that rehabilitating essential infrastructure will cost $350 million.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme and UNICEF have called for urgent international action to address the crisis, but aid delivery remains severely constrained by ongoing conflict and access restrictions. The government has declared 2026 &quot;the Year of Peace&quot; under a National Peace Initiative, but fighting continues in multiple regions. The UN Security Council is expected to receive a 120-day briefing on Sudan in February, with the UK — holding the Council&#39;s rotating presidency — planning to elevate the session to ministerial level.</p>

<h3>4. UAE Plans Housing Complex for Displaced Palestinians in Israeli-Controlled Southern Gaza</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United Arab Emirates has drafted plans to build the &quot;UAE Temporary Emirates Housing Complex&quot; to house thousands of displaced Palestinians in a part of southern Gaza under Israeli military control near Rafah, according to maps obtained by Reuters and Haaretz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proposed compound would sit near the &quot;Yellow Line&quot; agreed under an October ceasefire to demarcate Israeli- and Hamas-controlled areas. Rafah, once home to a quarter million people near the Egypt border, has been almost completely destroyed and depopulated by Israeli forces. The housing plan is part of broader reconstruction efforts expected to begin under U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s framework for a durable peace, with American officials hoping that building in Israeli-controlled areas could generate momentum toward Hamas&#39; disarmament.</p>
<p>The &quot;Alternative Safe Communities&quot; concept was designed as a way of gradually &quot;choking Hamas off&quot; by encouraging Gazans to leave Hamas-controlled zones, depriving the militant group of its civilian population. However, for the strategy to be effective, it would need to be built at scale, housing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Diplomats have expressed doubt about whether Palestinians would voluntarily move to areas under Israeli control.</p>
<p>International donors have been reluctant to commit funds to the plan, worried that disagreements over disarming Hamas militants could lead the parties back to full-scale conflict. The proposal has also raised concerns about potentially creating a permanent division of Gaza. Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions remain dire: UNRWA reports that Israel has blocked approximately 6,000 aid trucks destined for Gaza, with protesters blocking border crossings at Nitzana and Karem Abu Salem throughout early February.</p>

<h3>5. Japan Heads to Snap Election as PM Takaichi Seeks Mandate for Ruling Coalition</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japanese voters head to the polls on February 8 in snap elections called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan&#39;s first female premier, who is seeking to translate historically high approval ratings into a clear mandate for her Liberal Democratic Party-Japan Innovation Party coalition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The election comes just four months into Takaichi&#39;s tenure, which began on October 21, 2025, after she won the LDP presidential election. Polls show the LDP and its coalition partner are likely to secure more than 300 of the 465 seats in the House of Representatives, well above the 233 needed for a majority. Takaichi&#39;s cabinet approval rating stands at 62% in NHK surveys, with some polls placing her support in the 70% range — historically high figures that prompted the decision to call early elections.</p>
<p>The political landscape has been reshaped by a surprise opposition merger. On January 16, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, joined with Komeito — the LDP&#39;s former coalition partner for 26 years — to create a new party called the &quot;Centrist Reform Alliance.&quot; This realignment marks a significant shift in Japanese politics, with Komeito&#39;s departure from its longtime alliance with the LDP potentially signaling broader changes in the country&#39;s political dynamics.</p>
<p>Takaichi&#39;s economic program includes significant spending plans and potential tax relief measures that will be put before voters. The election is being closely watched internationally, particularly given Japan&#39;s strategic role in the U.S.-led alliance system in the Indo-Pacific and ongoing tensions with China over Taiwan. Analysts note that snap elections can be risky, but Takaichi appears to have calculated that her current popularity provides an optimal window to consolidate power.</p>

<h3>6. US-Iran Indirect Talks End &quot;For Now&quot; in Oman After Critical Nuclear Negotiations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iran announced that indirect talks with the United States mediated by Oman have concluded &quot;for now,&quot; following days of critical negotiations in Muscat where Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met separately with Omani officials and U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The talks represented a significant diplomatic effort amid weeks of escalating tensions, with negotiations shifting from the originally planned venue of Istanbul to Oman at the last minute. The Omani Foreign Minister served as intermediary, shuttling between the Iranian and American delegations. While specific details of the discussions remain confidential, the negotiations are understood to have focused on Iran&#39;s nuclear program and the broader regional security situation.</p>
<p>The talks come amid a severe domestic crisis in Iran, where protests have resulted in thousands of deaths according to human rights organizations. In a notable development during the lead-up to negotiations, Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi reportedly sent a personal message to U.S. Special Envoy Witkoff stating that Iran had canceled the planned execution of 800 anti-regime protesters. The international community has intensified pressure on Tehran, with the EU designating Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz have increased speed amid the heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran. The talks&#39; inconclusive ending — characterized by Iran as suspended &quot;for now&quot; rather than collapsed — leaves open the possibility of resumed negotiations, though the timeline and conditions remain unclear. Both sides face significant domestic political constraints that complicate any potential agreement.</p>

<h3>7. Starmer Apologizes to Epstein Victims as Mandelson Scandal Deepens UK Leadership Crisis</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer apologized to Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s victims for appointing Peter Mandelson as U.S. Ambassador, as Scotland Yard launched a criminal investigation into the veteran Labour politician on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he shared government information with the convicted sex offender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scandal has plunged Starmer&#39;s government into crisis, with Labour MPs describing the party mood as &quot;febrile and mutinous.&quot; Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party on February 1 and has since stepped down from the House of Lords amid mounting scrutiny. Leaked documents revealed serious allegations including reports that Mandelson and his husband received payments from Epstein, and that in 2009 and 2010, Mandelson allegedly passed sensitive government information to the financier.</p>
<p>Starmer defended his initial decision to appoint Mandelson, stating: &quot;If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government.&quot; Officials are reportedly drafting legislation to fast-track the removal of Mandelson&#39;s peerage. The Prime Minister is facing growing calls for his resignation, with critics arguing his handling of the issue has undermined public trust and raised national security concerns stemming from poor vetting processes.</p>
<p>The crisis comes at a challenging time for the UK government, with borrowing costs under pressure and the pound facing volatility. UK gilt yields have risen as markets assess the political uncertainty. The scandal has dominated British media coverage and Parliament, overshadowing the government&#39;s policy agenda. Opposition leaders have demanded a full independent inquiry into how Mandelson&#39;s appointment was approved despite his documented connections to Epstein.</p>

<h3>8. Taiwan-China Tensions Escalate as Beijing Masses 100,000 Troops for Strait Exercises</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>China has assembled nearly 100,000 troops along the Taiwan Strait for military exercises, with December drills involving 90 aircraft sorties crossing the center line, four amphibious assault ship formations, and 19 Chinese ships entering Taiwan&#39;s 24-mile buffer zone in what analysts describe as rehearsals for blockade scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Justice Mission&quot; exercises marked the first instance of Chinese military and coast guard vessels entering Taiwan&#39;s contiguous zone in significant numbers, representing a significant escalation in Beijing&#39;s pressure campaign. The late-year drills were widely interpreted as practice for coercive scenarios short of outright war — particularly a blockade or quarantine designed to strangle Taiwan economically and politically without triggering immediate global conflict.</p>
<p>Pentagon assessments indicate China aims to achieve by 2027 the capabilities required to prevail in a Taiwan conflict involving the United States. This requires three integrated strategic capabilities: the ability to credibly win at acceptable cost, deterring or constraining American intervention, and deterring involvement of U.S. allies and partners. The U.S. recently approved an $11 billion arms package for Taiwan and condemned Beijing&#39;s &quot;provocative&quot; military drills.</p>
<p>Despite the military buildup, life in Taiwan continues largely normally, with residents expressing determination rather than fear. The State Department has urged &quot;Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue.&quot; However, China has rejected such calls, framing U.S. arms sales as the primary threat to cross-strait stability. Analysts note that while invasion remains unlikely in the near term, the risk of miscalculation during increasingly aggressive exercises continues to grow.</p>

<h3>9. Mexico&#39;s Sheinbaum Defies Trump, Vows Nation &quot;Will Never Be Colony or Protectorate&quot;</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum delivered a defiant address marking the 109th anniversary of Mexico&#39;s 1917 Constitution, declaring &quot;México no regresará a ser colonia ni protectorado de nadie&quot; (Mexico will not return to being a colony or protectorate of anyone) while pledging to protect national resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speech came amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration over immigration, trade, and cartel violence. Sheinbaum directly rebutted Trump&#39;s assertions that criminal organizations control Mexico, stating on February 4: &quot;It is false that cartels govern Mexico.&quot; The rhetorical confrontation follows Trump&#39;s characterization of Mexico as a &quot;narco-state&quot; and his threats of significant tariffs and other punitive measures.</p>
<p>Despite the tensions, Mexico has maintained humanitarian assistance to Cuba, with Sheinbaum pledging to send food and other supplies while pursuing diplomatic channels to continue oil shipments &quot;without seeking confrontation.&quot; The Cuba issue has become another flashpoint with Washington, as Trump has escalated pressure on the island nation by cutting off oil supplies. Mexico&#39;s position reflects its traditional foreign policy principles of non-intervention and solidarity with Latin American neighbors.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum has also focused on domestic infrastructure development, conducting a two-day tour of Sonora where she inaugurated a highway and announced plans for a port modernization project on the Gulf of California. Her approval ratings remain strong despite the external pressures, as she seeks to balance Mexico&#39;s critical economic relationship with the United States against assertions of national sovereignty. The Trump administration&#39;s deportation operations and trade threats continue to test the bilateral relationship.</p>

<h3>10. North Korea Dismisses Vice Premier Ahead of Major Party Congress Unveiling Nuclear Plans</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kim Jong Un has dismissed a vice premier over troubles in a factory modernization project as he tightens discipline among officials ahead of a major Workers&#39; Party congress where North Korea plans to unveil &quot;next-stage plans for further bolstering up the country&#39;s nuclear war deterrent.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming party congress, the first of its kind in five years, represents one of the authoritarian regime&#39;s biggest propaganda spectacles and is intended to review projects, establish political and economic priorities, and reshuffle officials. Kim has been focusing on showcasing agricultural and infrastructure achievements, opening North Korea&#39;s largest greenhouse farm on the Chinese border and inaugurating the Sambaing Stockbreeding Farm with &quot;fashionable houses,&quot; a solar power station, hospital, and kindergarten.</p>
<p>Rising revenues from foreign trade and cybercrime are giving Kim greater policy options, enabling him to suppress certain economic sectors and pursue military priorities with fewer constraints. The regime ordered boosted missile production in 2026 and has conducted multiple ballistic missile tests in recent months. The Congress will likely formalize new military doctrines and potentially announce leadership changes as Kim consolidates power.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch&#39;s annual report described North Korea as maintaining &quot;unrelenting repression, hunger, and inequality,&quot; noting continued severe restrictions on freedoms and information. The international community has limited visibility into internal regime dynamics, though analysts suggest the dismissal of senior officials signals ongoing concerns about meeting Kim&#39;s ambitious modernization targets. The party congress dates have not been officially announced but are expected in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3>1. Wall Street Selloff Turns Into Stampede as Emerging Markets Post Worst Week Since November</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wall Street&#39;s retreat from risk accelerated into a full stampede this week, with emerging markets on track for their steepest weekly decline since November as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 1.5% on Friday and Korean shares triggered a circuit breaker after a 5% dive in the KOSPI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff has been driven by a steady drumbeat of negative news stoking anxiety about valuations many suspected had already run up too far. Alphabet&#39;s announcement of up to $185 billion in 2026 AI capital expenditures spooked investors concerned about the financial impact of massive AI investments. Rather than a single trigger, the rout reflects accumulated concerns about tech valuations, rising layoffs, and uncertainty over monetary policy.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 has now turned negative for 2026 after losing 1.23% on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.59%. Korean markets saw three program-trading halts in five sessions during one of the most volatile weeks in recent years, with the Kospi falling more than 5% in a single session before retail investors stepped in to prevent a break below 5,000. The carnage has spread across asset classes, with gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies all experiencing sharp declines.</p>
<p>The broader market tracked declines across Asian peers after Wall Street closed mostly lower overnight, amid a persistent tech sector selloff. Most &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; mega-cap names remain under pressure, though the divergence between AI infrastructure enablers and application-layer software companies has become increasingly pronounced. Investors face limited visibility with the January jobs report delayed indefinitely due to the government shutdown.</p>

<h3>2. US January Layoffs Hit Highest Level Since 2009 as Hiring Plans Collapse</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S.-based employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January — a threefold increase from December and more than double January 2025 — marking the highest January layoff total since 2009, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About 40% of the January layoff announcements came from just two firms: UPS (30,000 cuts tied to its wind-down of Amazon delivery arrangements) and Amazon (16,000 cuts). The healthcare industry announced more than 17,000 job cuts, the highest in that sector since April 2020. January&#39;s layoff announcements were concentrated in five industries: transportation, technology, healthcare and health products, chemicals, and financial services.</p>
<p>Companies announced just 5,306 new hires in January, also the lowest for the month since Challenger began tracking the data in 2009. Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 31 rose to 231,000, an increase of 22,000 from the prior week. The data paints a picture of a &quot;low-hire, low-fire&quot; environment that appears to be deteriorating as employers grow pessimistic about the 2026 outlook.</p>
<p>The labor market weakness comes at a particularly challenging time, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics unable to release the January jobs report due to the government shutdown. &quot;Most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026,&quot; noted Andy Challenger. The data may fuel concerns among Federal Reserve policymakers about whether additional support is needed for the economy.</p>

<h3>3. AMD Crashes 17% in Worst Rout Since 2017 as AI Guidance Disappoints</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices suffered its worst single-day decline since 2017, plunging 17% after issuing first-quarter guidance that fell short of the market&#39;s most bullish AI expectations despite posting record Q4 revenue of $10.27 billion — up 23% year-over-year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff erased more than $60 billion in market capitalization in a single trading session, with shares closing at $200.19. AMD guided Q1 revenue of approximately $9.8 billion — a 5% sequential decline that investors interpreted as a sign of slowing momentum despite the figure exceeding analyst consensus of $9.38 billion. In a market conditioned to expect &quot;Nvidia-style&quot; exponential growth every quarter, this seasonal dip triggered massive profit-taking.</p>
<p>Prior to the crash, AMD shares had roughly doubled over the past year amid the AI infrastructure boom. CEO Lisa Su noted that the company is in &quot;active discussions&quot; for additional sales of its next-generation MI450 chip, with the ramp &quot;on schedule to start in the second half of the year.&quot; However, concerns mounted that a significant portion of Q4 data center revenue came from $390 million in China-bound AI chip sales approved under a U.S. license.</p>
<p>Cathie Wood&#39;s ARK Invest responded to the crash by purchasing $28 million in AMD shares. Deutsche Bank maintained a hold rating, noting the second half of 2026 could be an inflection point, while Barclays maintained an overweight rating with a $300 price target implying 24% upside. The reaction reflects a broader challenge facing semiconductor companies outside of Nvidia: even strong results are being punished when guidance fails to meet the most optimistic scenarios.</p>

<h3>4. Oracle Announces $50 Billion Capital Raise for Cloud Infrastructure Expansion</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion in 2026 through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, reflecting the unprecedented scale of financing needed to meet AI-driven demand from major customers including AMD, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, TikTok, and xAI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The financing structure will see approximately half raised through equity-linked and common equity issuances, including mandatory convertible preferred securities and a new at-the-market equity program of up to $20 billion. The debt portion will be completed through a single investment-grade senior unsecured bond issuance early in 2026. Goldman Sachs will lead the bond offering, while Citigroup will lead the equity issuances.</p>
<p>Oracle&#39;s announcement underscores the massive capital requirements facing cloud infrastructure providers competing for AI workloads. Unlike hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that can largely self-fund expansion, Oracle is turning to capital markets to keep pace with contracted demand from its largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers. The raise represents one of the largest corporate capital raises in recent memory.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s stock has benefited from the AI infrastructure buildout, with Oracle positioning itself as a key player in providing the computing capacity needed for training and running large language models. The capital raise will fund new data centers, server procurement, and networking infrastructure. Analysts note that while the dilutive impact of equity issuance is a concern, Oracle&#39;s contracted backlog provides visibility into future revenue streams that justify the investment.</p>

<h3>5. Nvidia-OpenAI $100 Billion Deal Stalls as Negotiations Go &quot;On Ice&quot;</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five months after OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion deal, no contract has been signed and no money has changed hands, with Wall Street Journal reporting that negotiations are &quot;on ice&quot; after Nvidia executives expressed doubts about OpenAI&#39;s business model and lack of business discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has told industry associates that the investment was &quot;nonbinding and not finalized,&quot; while criticizing what he characterized as insufficient discipline in OpenAI&#39;s business strategy. Huang also shared concerns about competition from firms like Google and Anthropic. Since the deal was announced, the relationship has become more complicated: Nvidia has invested in rival AI labs, while OpenAI struck a $10 billion deal with chip startup Cerebras and has pursued partnerships with AMD and Broadcom for custom AI chips.</p>
<p>Huang publicly denied reports that he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling such characterizations &quot;nonsense&quot; and stating: &quot;We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time.&quot; However, analysts suggest any eventual investment will likely be in the $20-30 billion range rather than the originally announced $100 billion.</p>
<p>The stalled negotiations highlight the evolving dynamics in the AI industry, where the largest players are increasingly hedging their bets across multiple partnerships and technologies. Nvidia&#39;s dominant position in AI chips gives it leverage in these negotiations, while OpenAI&#39;s need for computing capacity to train next-generation models creates pressure to secure supply from multiple sources. The ultimate resolution of these talks will signal how the AI ecosystem&#39;s major players are aligning for the next phase of competition.</p>

<h3>6. Uber Falls 5% Despite Record Quarter as Guidance Disappoints</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uber shares dropped 5.2% after the company reported record Q4 results including 3.6 billion trips and 200 million monthly active users, but issued Q1 2026 guidance below Wall Street&#39;s aggressive targets for both mobility and delivery segments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company reported Q4 revenue of $14.37 billion, a 20% year-over-year increase, but adjusted EPS of $0.71 missed the analyst consensus of $0.80 by nearly 11%. The shortfall was largely attributed to a $1.6 billion pre-tax headwind from equity investment revaluations and rising operational costs. For Q1 2026, Uber projected adjusted EBITDA and bookings below expectations, suggesting a sequential slowdown in demand.</p>
<p>Lyft shares fell 3.1% in sympathy with Uber&#39;s decline, with the rival ride-hailing company scheduled to report its own Q4 results on February 10. The weak guidance from Uber raises questions about the broader on-demand economy&#39;s trajectory as consumers face persistent inflation pressures. Both companies have been expanding into new verticals including autonomous vehicles, grocery delivery, and advertising.</p>
<p>Despite the guidance concerns, Uber announced plans to expand autonomous vehicle trips to up to 15 cities by year-end, including Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Munich, Hong Kong, Zurich, and Madrid. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi stated that by 2029, Uber intends to be the world&#39;s largest facilitator of autonomous vehicle trips. The company&#39;s AV strategy — partnering with technology companies rather than building its own self-driving systems — positions it to benefit regardless of which autonomous technology ultimately prevails.</p>

<h3>7. ECB and Bank of England Hold Rates Steady Amid Growth and Inflation Uncertainty</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank held interest rates unchanged at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, while the Bank of England voted 5-4 to maintain rates at 3.75% in a closer-than-expected decision that signals internal divisions over the pace of monetary easing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ECB commented that inflation trajectory and economic conditions did not warrant a move, but warned the outlook was &quot;unpredictable&quot; given tariff threats and currency volatility. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the rest of 2026, with ECB President Lagarde playing down concerns about the euro&#39;s recent rally. The updated assessment confirms that inflation should stabilize at the 2% target in the medium term.</p>
<p>The Bank of England&#39;s decision was notably closer than expected, with four members voting to cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.5% versus forecasts of a 7-2 hold. The narrow margin demonstrates building pressure for rate cuts despite inflation remaining above target. Pay growth and services price inflation have generally continued to ease, reflecting the impact of monetary policy and evidence of subdued economic growth.</p>
<p>Both central banks face challenging balancing acts as they navigate persistent inflation pressures against slowing growth and external risks from potential U.S. tariffs. UK borrowing costs have come under pressure amid the Mandelson political crisis, while eurozone economies grapple with weak manufacturing and uncertain trade policy. Economists expect the Bank of England could begin cutting as early as March or April if economic data weakens further.</p>

<h3>8. ARM Holdings Beats Estimates as Chip Designer Posts Fourth Consecutive Billion-Dollar Quarter</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ARM Holdings reported Q3 fiscal 2026 earnings of $0.43 per share, beating the $0.41 consensus, with revenue rising 26% to $1.24 billion as the chip designer extends its record-breaking momentum driven by AI-related demand for its processor architectures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>License revenue rose 25% to $505 million while royalty revenue increased 27% to $737 million, driven by higher royalty rates for newer products like Armv9 and Arm compute subsystems. The company provided strong Q4 guidance with EPS of $0.54-0.62 (versus consensus of $0.49) and revenue of $1.4-1.5 billion (above the $1.4 billion consensus), marking what would be its ninth consecutive earnings beat.</p>
<p>ARM shares initially traded lower following the after-hours report before recovering during the regular session the next day. The volatile reaction reflects the heightened scrutiny facing semiconductor stocks amid the broader tech selloff, even when companies deliver strong results. ARM&#39;s business model — licensing chip designs rather than manufacturing them — provides exposure to virtually every segment of the semiconductor market.</p>
<p>The company benefits from the proliferation of AI across devices from data centers to smartphones, with its power-efficient architectures increasingly favored for AI inference workloads. ARM&#39;s customer base includes nearly every major technology company, providing diversified exposure to the AI buildout. Analysts note that ARM&#39;s royalty rate increases on newer chip designs could drive continued revenue growth even if unit shipments stabilize.</p>

<h3>9. Philip Morris Reports Record Year as Smoke-Free Products Reach 41.5% of Sales</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philip Morris International reported full-year 2025 results with net revenue reaching $40.6 billion and smoke-free products rising to 41.5% of total sales, while guiding for 11-13% EPS growth in 2026 and setting new three-year targets for revenue and operating income growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q4 results came in line with expectations, with adjusted diluted EPS of $7.54 for the full year representing growth of 14.8% versus 2024. The company&#39;s transformation away from traditional cigarettes continues to accelerate, with smoke-free products now comprising more than $17 billion of annual revenue. PMI set 2026-2028 compound annual growth targets of 6-8% for net revenues on an organic basis and 9-11% for adjusted diluted EPS.</p>
<p>The company described 2025 as &quot;another remarkable year of results&quot; with a fifth consecutive year of volume growth and strong operating margin expansion. Shares traded down 1.4% to $179.50 following the release, with investors having largely priced in the strong performance. The 2026 guidance suggests continued momentum in the company&#39;s pivot toward reduced-risk products including heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.</p>
<p>PMI&#39;s transformation story contrasts with challenges facing traditional tobacco companies as smoking rates decline in developed markets. The company&#39;s IQOS heated tobacco system and ZYN nicotine pouches have emerged as significant growth drivers. However, management warned of global pricing declines in the low- to mid-teens percentage range driven by its deal with the Trump administration, new direct-to-consumer pricing, and lower Medicaid pricing on older products.</p>

<h3>10. KOSPI Triggers Three Circuit Breakers in Five Sessions as Korean Markets Whipsaw</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>South Korea&#39;s stock market experienced one of its most volatile weeks in recent memory, with three program-trading halts triggered in five sessions as the KOSPI swung between daily drops of over 5% and rallies of nearly 7%, testing investor resolve during the global tech selloff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The circuit breaker mechanism — triggered when KOSPI 200 futures move more than 5% from the previous day&#39;s close within a single minute — activated repeatedly as global tech concerns cascaded through Asian markets. On Monday, the Kospi fell 5.26% in a single session, triggering a brief halt and breaking below the 5,000 level. A day later it surged 6.84%, forcing another halt. Friday saw a third sidecar activation as panic selling briefly sent the index below 4,900.</p>
<p>Retail investors provided crucial support during the volatility, stepping in to buy during the sharpest selloffs and keeping the benchmark above 5,000 by Friday&#39;s close. The Korean market&#39;s sensitivity to tech sector sentiment reflects its heavy weighting toward semiconductor and electronics companies, particularly Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, which are exposed to global AI-related demand fluctuations.</p>
<p>The extreme volatility highlights how concentrated bets on AI-related themes have created fragile market conditions that can unwind rapidly when sentiment shifts. Korean shares led the emerging market selloff, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index posting its steepest weekly decline since November. Analysts note that while fundamental valuations have become more attractive, technical damage from the volatility may take time to repair.</p>

<h3>1. Ukraine and Russia Exchange 314 Prisoners After Abu Dhabi Talks, First Swap in Five Months</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi concluded with Ukraine and Russia agreeing to exchange 314 prisoners of war—the first such swap since October—while the US and Russia committed to reestablishing military-to-military dialogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trilateral talks between American, Ukrainian, and Russian negotiators concluded in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, with both Moscow and Kyiv exchanging 157 prisoners each. The Ukrainians returned home included soldiers from the Armed Forces, National Guard, and the State Border Guard Service, with most having been in captivity since 2022. US presidential peace envoy Steve Witkoff led the American mediation team alongside Jared Kushner, Trump&#39;s son-in-law, calling the exchange &quot;tangible progress&quot; while acknowledging significant work remains to end the war.</p>
<p>The negotiations took place over two days in Abu Dhabi, with officials working in trilateral consultations, group work, and synchronization of positions. The Ukrainian delegation included Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine&#39;s National Security and Defense Council, and Andrii Hnatov, the chief of the General Staff. The Russian team was led by Kiril Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and Igor Kostyukov, head of the GRU military intelligence service. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there are reasons to be &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about the trajectory of talks.</p>
<p>Beyond the prisoner exchange, the US and Russia agreed to reestablish high-level military-to-military dialogue—a significant development given the near-complete breakdown in communication between the two nuclear powers since 2022. The talks came as President Zelenskyy called on Trump to send more weapons to put Ukraine in a better position to force Russian President Putin to end the war. The EU has also agreed on a €90 billion loan to finance Kyiv&#39;s defense against Russia, signaling continued European support regardless of the outcome of US-brokered negotiations.</p>
<h3>2. UK Prime Minister Starmer Apologizes to Epstein Victims as Leadership Crisis Deepens</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly apologized to Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s victims for appointing Peter Mandelson as US ambassador, claiming the diplomat &quot;lied repeatedly&quot; about his relationship with the convicted sex offender as newly released DOJ files revealed the full extent of their ties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an excruciating display before Parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer apologized to victims of Jeffrey Epstein after the US Justice Department released files revealing new details of Peter Mandelson&#39;s close relationship with the late sex offender. Starmer stated he was &quot;sorry&quot; directly to the victims, adding that &quot;if I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government.&quot; The apology came as pressure mounted from Labour MPs angry at Starmer&#39;s decision to appoint Mandelson despite knowing about his links to Epstein.</p>
<p>Starmer had appointed Mandelson as ambassador to the US in December 2024 and fired him last September after emails showed he maintained a friendship with Epstein following the financier&#39;s 2008 conviction for sex offenses involving minors. The newly released DOJ files suggested Mandelson had leaked government documents to Epstein and that Epstein had recorded payments to Mandelson or his then-partner. Bank documents show Epstein sent three payments totaling $75,000 between 2003 and 2004 to accounts linked to Mandelson, though Mandelson claims he does not remember receiving the money.</p>
<p>The prime minister now faces speculation about a challenge to his leadership from within the Labour Party, less than two years after winning a landslide election victory. The Metropolitan Police confirmed they have launched an investigation &quot;into a 72-year-old man, a former Government Minister, for misconduct in public office offence.&quot; The scandal has left a vacuum in Labour&#39;s transatlantic strategy at a critical moment in UK-US relations, with Mandelson&#39;s resignation from the House of Lords and the Labour Party marking a dramatic fall for one of Britain&#39;s most influential political figures.</p>
<h3>3. US Launches Renewed Strikes Against ISIS in Syria After Palmyra Ambush</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>US Central Command announced five strikes against multiple Islamic State targets in Syria as part of &quot;Operation Hawkeye Strike,&quot; a sustained campaign launched after a December 2025 ambush killed two US service members and an American interpreter near Palmyra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between January 27 and February 2, US forces carried out five strikes against various ISIS targets, destroying a communication site, a critical logistics center, and weapons storage facilities with 50 precision munitions delivered by fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and unmanned aircraft. The strikes are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, CENTCOM&#39;s response to a December 13, 2025 ISIS ambush against US and Syrian forces in Palmyra that left two American service members and an interpreter dead—the deadliest attack on US forces in Syria since the establishment of the counter-ISIS mission.</p>
<p>Since the operation&#39;s launch, CENTCOM has killed or captured more than 50 ISIS members, including Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, an ISIS leader directly connected to the Palmyra ambush who was killed in a January 16 strike. The campaign underscores the persistent ISIS threat in Syria despite years of territorial defeat, with the group maintaining operational capability through cells scattered across the Syrian desert. A UN official warned this week of rising ISIS attacks worldwide, noting the group has exploited instability in Syria and other regions to rebuild its networks.</p>
<p>The strikes came as Syria undergoes significant political transformation following the integration of Kurdish forces under a US-brokered deal in early February. The new transitional government has struggled to establish security across the country&#39;s fractured territory, with ISIS capitalizing on governance vacuums. The US maintains approximately 900 troops in Syria focused on counter-ISIS operations, a presence that has drawn criticism from various quarters but which military officials argue remains essential to preventing the group&#39;s resurgence.</p>
<h3>4. Iran and US Set for High-Stakes Nuclear Talks in Oman After Last-Minute Venue Change</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States are scheduled for Friday in Oman after the original Turkey venue nearly collapsed over disagreements about scope and format, with Tehran seeking narrow discussions on its nuclear program while Washington pushes for broader topics including missiles and regional proxies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed that Iran and the US will hold nuclear talks at 10am in Muscat on Friday (06:00 GMT), after Oman salvaged negotiations that had nearly derailed over disagreements about both the location and format of discussions. The original plan called for talks in Turkey with foreign ministers from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey participating as mediators, but Tehran pulled back from earlier understandings, reportedly wanting discussions limited strictly to its nuclear program with only Iranian and US officials at the table.</p>
<p>The stakes are immense given the expiration of the New START treaty on February 5, which ends the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the US and Russia. While that treaty did not directly involve Iran, the broader nuclear non-proliferation framework is under unprecedented strain. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made clear that Washington hopes discussions will extend beyond nuclear issues to include Iran&#39;s ballistic missile program, its support for proxy groups across the Middle East, and &quot;the treatment of their own people&quot;—a reference to the ongoing brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that has killed over 6,400 people.</p>
<p>President Trump struck a tough note ahead of discussions, issuing a blunt warning to Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader: &quot;I would say he should be very worried.&quot; The talks come amid heightened tensions following Iran&#39;s violent suppression of protests and continued concerns about its nuclear enrichment activities. Oil prices slid more than 2% on Thursday as markets anticipated potential de-escalation from the talks, with Brent crude falling to $67.73 per barrel and WTI dropping to $63.47.</p>
<h3>5. Philippines and China Trade Barbs as South China Sea Tensions Escalate</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Philippines expressed alarm over escalating verbal confrontations with Chinese diplomats in Manila as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. rejected calls to expel China&#39;s ambassador, while Manila pushes to conclude a legally binding South China Sea code of conduct during its ASEAN chairmanship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Philippines told China on Monday that it is alarmed about heated exchanges with Chinese diplomats in Manila over the long-standing territorial dispute in the South China Sea, though Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. rejected calls to expel China&#39;s ambassador despite furious political reaction to the diplomatic confrontations. The escalation comes against a backdrop of years of raised tensions, as Marcos&#39;s strengthening of security ties with the United States has provoked Beijing&#39;s ire and the rate of incidents in the disputed waters has accelerated.</p>
<p>As ASEAN chair for 2026, the Philippines has prioritized two parallel initiatives: renewed efforts to finalize a legally binding code of conduct with China and a dramatic expansion of US-Philippines military cooperation, with more than 500 joint activities planned for the year. Analysts note that escalating clashes between the Philippines and China have not only raised the urgency of a regional code of conduct but created a volatile environment where the threshold for war is lowering and red lines are vanishing. The Philippines is adamant that any agreement should be legally binding and monitored by ASEAN-led mechanisms—a stance strongly opposed by China.</p>
<p>The tensions extend beyond diplomatic rhetoric to physical confrontations at sea. China&#39;s December military drills around Taiwan covered a larger area than any exercises since 2022, with over 130 aircraft sorties into Taiwan&#39;s air defense identification zone, affecting 857 international flights and more than 100,000 travelers. The normalization of People&#39;s Liberation Army activity within Taiwan&#39;s contiguous zone—the 12-nautical-mile buffer surrounding its territorial waters—marks a subtle but consequential shift that increases the risk of miscalculation across the broader Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<h3>6. India-US Trade Deal Reaches Final Stage as Jaishankar Concludes Washington Visit</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that the &quot;historic&quot; India-US trade agreement is in final stages of detailing, signaling a new phase in bilateral ties following President Trump&#39;s announcement of reduced tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following wide-ranging talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington DC, India&#39;s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar stated that the long-awaited India-US trade deal has reached its final stage with only technical and formal work remaining. The announcement came three days after President Trump revealed the reduction of US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% under the trade framework, representing a significant breakthrough after nearly a year of negotiations between the two nations.</p>
<p>The trade deal is expected to open a new phase in bilateral relations marked by expanding cooperation across trade, strategic affairs, defense, energy, and critical minerals. Discussions with Rubio covered multiple pillars of the relationship, with particular emphasis on technology cooperation and defense manufacturing. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, who has been in direct engagement with the US Trade Representative, will detail the formal announcement timelines after several areas have been finalized.</p>
<p>The deal represents a significant development after tensions earlier in 2026 related to trade tariffs, and positions India as a key partner in the Trump administration&#39;s effort to diversify supply chains away from China. Critical mineral cooperation between the two nations is also &quot;advancing rapidly,&quot; according to Jaishankar, aligning with the broader US strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese mineral supplies. The breakthrough comes as India plans to raise defense spending by 18% in the coming fiscal year, with New Delhi earmarking about 2.2 trillion rupees ($23.9 billion) for defense-related capital spending.</p>
<h3>7. Egypt and Sudan Reject Unilateral Nile Actions as GERD Tensions Mount</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers met in Cairo to condemn Ethiopia&#39;s unilateral dam operations on the Blue Nile, reaffirming their joint rejection of any actions that could harm downstream nations while calling for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan&#39;s ongoing civil war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Egypt&#39;s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Sudanese Foreign Minister Mohieddin Salem met in Cairo on Tuesday, explicitly rejecting unilateral measures on the Blue Nile where Ethiopia has built the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)—a project disputed by both downstream nations. Abdelatty also condemned &quot;horrific atrocities and violations&quot; in Sudan&#39;s El Fasher and Kordofan regions, calling for an immediate, comprehensive ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access while reaffirming Egypt&#39;s rejection of any attempts to partition Sudan.</p>
<p>The tensions relate to rising Nile floods that have reignited disputes over the GERD, with accusations of uncoordinated dam releases and climate impacts heightening regional water conflicts. Ethiopia&#39;s fourth filling of the dam trapped nearly 24 billion cubic meters of water in its reservoir—a move Cairo has condemned as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and a direct threat to its national security. Over the past decade, talks over the dam led by the African Union, European Union, and United States have failed to produce a binding agreement, with Ethiopia preferring a flexible and sovereign approach while Egypt insists on fixed legal guarantees.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Sudan&#39;s Abdel Fattah al-Burhan met in Cairo last week, agreeing to enhance coordination on water security and establish new communication channels to anticipate sudden flood events. The fundamental dispute remains unresolved, with the dam now operational and Egypt heavily dependent on the Nile for its water needs. Analysts warn that population growth and climate change could intensify GERD tensions, urging pragmatic cooperation across the Nile Basin before the situation deteriorates further.</p>
<h3>8. Poland Accelerates Eastern Border Fortification Amid Belarus Hybrid Warfare</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poland announced plans to secure 200 kilometers of its eastern border by year-end 2026 and closed ten crossings with Russia and Belarus, as Warsaw invests heavily in anti-drone systems and surveillance capabilities to counter ongoing hybrid warfare tactics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poland has already secured 60 kilometers of its eastern border and plans to expand fortifications to more than 200 kilometers by year-end 2026, accelerating a military engineering program designed to harden the frontier with Belarus and Russia. Effective January 6, 2026, Poland shut ten road, rail, and pedestrian crossings with Russia&#39;s Kaliningrad region and Belarus, citing security risks linked to irregular migration orchestrated by Minsk. The border closures and fortification efforts reflect Warsaw&#39;s determination to counter what it describes as systematic hybrid warfare from its eastern neighbors.</p>
<p>The tensions stem from multiple factors: a migration crisis that Poland accuses Belarus of instrumentalizing, the presence of thousands of Russian Wagner mercenaries in Belarus who have reportedly conducted training near the border, and Moscow&#39;s deployment of short-range nuclear weapons into Belarus near the NATO frontier. Poland is investing heavily in modern surveillance and strike capabilities, including anti-aircraft and counter-drone systems, unmanned aerial platforms, mine-laying vehicles, and reconnaissance assets. The country is set to receive nearly €44 billion from the EU&#39;s €150 billion SAFE facility to finance more than 130 defense projects.</p>
<p>The border fortification comes as part of the broader EU ReArm Europe plan, which aims to mobilize €800 billion across member states to boost defense spending. Poland, Baltic states, and Finland have warned they could fully seal borders with Belarus if military and migrant tensions grow further. In October 2024, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a temporary suspension of the right to asylum in Poland, a decision supported by 386 out of 460 members of parliament—reflecting the political consensus around border security even as human rights groups warn of humanitarian consequences for migrants trapped between borders.</p>
<h3>9. Pakistan Boycotts India at T20 World Cup in Show of Solidarity with Bangladesh</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed Pakistan will boycott its scheduled match against India at the T20 World Cup 2026 in solidarity with Bangladesh, which was removed from the tournament amid disputes over hosting arrangements under the India-Sri Lanka hybrid model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced that Pakistan&#39;s decision to boycott the game against India at the men&#39;s T20 World Cup 2026 was a show of solidarity with Bangladesh, which was removed from the tournament and replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh&#39;s ouster followed disputes related to hosting arrangements, security concerns, and scheduling under the hybrid model involving India and Sri Lanka—a decision that triggered widespread criticism over what was described as inconsistent treatment by the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p>
<p>The boycott represents a dramatic escalation in cricket diplomacy between the nuclear-armed rivals, with the ICC now engaged in back-channel talks with Pakistan to salvage the fixture. Pakistan had expressed solidarity with Bangladesh earlier in the row, and Sharif&#39;s announcement formalized what had been building tension between Islamabad and cricket&#39;s governing body. The development comes against a backdrop of warming Pakistan-Bangladesh ties, with the two nations resuming direct trade for the first time since the 1971 war under an agreement negotiated by Bangladesh&#39;s interim government.</p>
<p>An unexpected handshake between India&#39;s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar and Pakistan&#39;s National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq in Dhaka in late December 2025—ahead of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia&#39;s funeral—had prompted speculation about whether India and Pakistan might cautiously restart dialogue in 2026. However, the cricket boycott suggests any diplomatic thaw remains distant. Pakistan&#39;s growing footprint in Bangladesh has raised alarm bells in New Delhi, with analysts noting that Islamabad&#39;s engagement with Dhaka&#39;s interim government under Muhammad Yunus has accelerated considerably since the August 2024 political transition.</p>
<h3>10. Houthis Signal End to Red Sea Shipping Attacks as Industry Eyes Cautious Return</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Houthi leadership declared an end to their campaign against maritime interests connected to Israel following a US-Houthi ceasefire mediated by Oman in May, with shipping analysts predicting 2026 could mark the large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Houthi leadership in Yemen has declared they will bring an end to their campaign against maritime interests connected to Israel, following the US-Houthi ceasefire mediated by Oman in May 2025. Since the ceasefire, Houthi attacks on shipping were theoretically limited to vessels with links to Israel, though the broader Red Sea shipping crisis that began in late 2023 had disrupted global trade routes and forced major carriers to divert around Africa&#39;s Cape of Good Hope at significant additional cost and time.</p>
<p>Analysts at Xeneta and other maritime consultancies suggest 2026 could mark the year container ships make a large-scale return to the Red Sea, with the prime window for route adjustment coming immediately after Lunar New Year in mid-February. However, shipping carriers and insurers remain highly cautious, demanding significant and sustained assurances of safety beyond Houthi statements before committing to a full return. The Red Sea crisis had added approximately $7-8 per barrel in geopolitical risk premium to oil prices at its peak.</p>
<p>The potential return to normalcy would represent a significant shift for global logistics, as the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal cuts thousands of miles off voyages between Asia and Europe. The crisis had forced nearly all major shipping lines to avoid the region, increasing freight costs and delivery times across global supply chains. However, experts caution that it will take time to bring back &quot;normality&quot; to the region, with the security situation requiring sustained improvement before commercial operations fully resume.</p>

<h3>1. Alphabet Announces $185 Billion AI Spending Plan as Q4 Beats Expectations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&#39;s parent company reported record Q4 revenue of $113.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, but shares slipped after projecting 2026 capital expenditures of up to $185 billion—more than double 2025&#39;s spend—as the company goes all-in on AI infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alphabet delivered fourth quarter revenue of $113.8 billion, beating analyst expectations while reporting earnings per share of $2.82, a 31% year-over-year increase that also topped the $2.63 consensus estimate. For the full year, Alphabet topped $400 billion in revenue for the first time, with net income climbing 30% to $34.5 billion. Google Cloud beat Wall Street&#39;s expectations with nearly 48% revenue growth from a year ago, and its backlog more than doubled year-over-year to reach $240 billion at quarter&#39;s end.</p>
<p>However, the company&#39;s outlook for 2026 capital expenditures spooked investors, with Alphabet projecting spend in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion—the top end of which would be more than double its $91.4 billion investment in 2025. The spending will ramp through the year as the company invests in AI compute capacity for DeepMind, Search and ads improvements, Cloud demand, and Other Bets. Shares slipped 0.8% by market close despite the earnings beat, reflecting investor concern about the aggressive spending trajectory.</p>
<p>CEO Sundar Pichai reported that Gemini AI now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter, while the company achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations and efficiency improvements. The results set the tone for a brutal trading session on Thursday, with the broader market selling off on concerns about AI spending sustainability across the technology sector.</p>
<h3>2. Qualcomm Plunges 11% on Weak Guidance as Global Memory Shortage Bites</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chipmaker Qualcomm reported fiscal Q1 earnings that beat expectations but shares crashed after issuing disappointing Q2 guidance, with CEO Cristiano Amon attributing the cautious outlook to a global memory shortage constraining the handset business through at least fiscal 2027.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Qualcomm shares plummeted nearly 11% in premarket trading Thursday after the semiconductor giant&#39;s disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter overshadowed a strong Q1 earnings beat. The company reported $3.50 EPS for the quarter, topping analysts&#39; consensus of $3.38, with revenue of $12.25 billion slightly exceeding the $12.16 billion estimate. However, Q2 2026 guidance of $10.2 billion to $11 billion in revenue and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.65 fell significantly short of analyst expectations for $11.02 billion and $2.87 respectively.</p>
<p>CEO Cristiano Amon attributed the cautious outlook to ongoing global memory shortages that are constraining the handset business, as smartphone customers adjust their inventories and purchase decisions amid supply constraints. Qualcomm executives indicated the memory supply shortage could last through the entire current fiscal year, potentially dragging supply pressures into calendar year 2027. The warning added to concerns about supply chain fragility across the semiconductor sector.</p>
<p>Multiple analysts lowered their price targets following the report, with the stock closing Thursday at $132.49, down from $148.89 the prior day. The selloff contributed to the broader tech rout that pushed the Nasdaq down 1.59% and sent the S&amp;P 500 into negative territory for the year. Qualcomm&#39;s guidance miss highlights the uneven nature of the AI-driven semiconductor boom, with companies closest to AI compute benefiting while those in adjacent markets face continued headwinds.</p>
<h3>3. Amazon Stock Crashes 10% After Announcing $200 Billion 2026 Spending Plan</h3>

<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon reported Q4 revenue of $213.39 billion and AWS cloud growth of 24%—its fastest in 13 quarters—but shares plunged in extended trading after the company boosted its 2026 capital expenditure forecast to $200 billion, far exceeding the $146.6 billion analysts expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon delivered mixed fourth-quarter results after market close Thursday, with revenue of $213.39 billion up 14% year-over-year and beating the $211.30 billion consensus, while earnings per share of $1.95 slightly missed the $1.97 estimate. The clear highlight was AWS, which expanded 24% during the quarter—its fastest growth in 13 quarters—with revenue of $35.58 billion topping analyst expectations of $34.93 billion. AWS operating income reached $12.47 billion with margins widening to 35%.</p>
<p>However, Amazon shares plunged more than 10% in extended trading after the company announced 2026 capital expenditure plans of $200 billion, dramatically exceeding the $146.6 billion analysts had expected. The spending surge reflects Amazon&#39;s commitment to AI infrastructure buildout, with CEO Andy Jassy citing the need to invest in AI compute capacity to meet surging demand. The announcement came as Amazon confirmed plans to eliminate 16,000 corporate roles—the largest workforce reduction in company history—bringing its four-month layoff total to 30,000.</p>
<p>The earnings report caps a challenging period for Amazon investors, with the company caught between the imperative to invest massively in AI infrastructure and pressure to demonstrate profitability improvements. The spending forecast aligns with similar aggressive AI investment announcements from Microsoft and Alphabet this earnings season, but Amazon&#39;s guidance was the most dramatic departure from expectations. Analysts will closely watch whether the AI investments translate into revenue growth or become a drag on margins.</p>
<h3>4. Strategy (MicroStrategy) Plunges 17% After Reporting $12.4 Billion Net Loss</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Saylor&#39;s crypto-focused company reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion and net loss of $12.4 billion for Q4 2025 as Bitcoin&#39;s extended decline crushed the value of its 713,502 Bitcoin holdings, sending shares to their lowest level since early 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) reported dismal Q4 2025 results on Thursday, with an operating loss of $17.4 billion compared to $1 billion in Q4 2024, and a net loss of $12.4 billion, or $42.93 per share—far exceeding the $670.8 million loss in the year-ago quarter. Total revenues came in at just $123 million with gross profit of $81.3 million, as the company&#39;s core software business continues to shrink while its identity as a Bitcoin holding company faces its most severe test.</p>
<p>The company holds 713,502 Bitcoin acquired at a total cost of $54.26 billion, or $76,052 per coin, but with Bitcoin trading below $70,000 on Thursday, Strategy faces $24.3 billion in implied unrealized losses on its crypto holdings. The stock closed at $106.99, down 17% on the day and 71.8% below its 52-week high of $457.22 reached in July 2025. Strategy&#39;s shares have dropped 67% over the past year as Bitcoin&#39;s extended bear market has decimated the premium investors were willing to pay for leveraged crypto exposure.</p>
<p>Michael Saylor&#39;s bet-the-company strategy on Bitcoin has faced increasing scrutiny as the cryptocurrency has fallen nearly 50% from its October 2024 peak near $126,000. The company&#39;s convertible debt structure and continued Bitcoin purchases through the downturn have raised concerns about its ability to withstand a prolonged crypto winter. Thursday&#39;s results illustrated the extreme volatility inherent in Saylor&#39;s approach, with the magnitude of losses dwarfing the company&#39;s underlying software operations.</p>
<h3>5. January Layoffs Hit Highest Level Since 2009 as Amazon and UPS Lead Cuts</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>US employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January—the highest for any January since 2009—while hiring intentions reached their lowest since the same period, with Amazon&#39;s 16,000-job cut and UPS&#39;s 30,000-position elimination accounting for 40% of the total.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas report revealed that US employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025—marking the highest January total since the depths of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Hiring announcements were equally grim, with companies announcing just 5,306 new hires, the lowest January figure since 2009. Andy Challenger, the firm&#39;s chief revenue officer, stated the data signals employers are &quot;less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.&quot;</p>
<p>About 40% of January&#39;s layoff announcements came from just two companies: Amazon, which outlined plans for 16,000 corporate job cuts as part of an AI restructuring, and UPS, which announced 30,000 positions will be eliminated as it winds down its partnership with Amazon. The UPS cuts are part of the company&#39;s pivot from Amazon shipments to higher-margin customers, with the company expecting $3 billion in savings from network optimization. Amazon&#39;s reductions, the largest in company history, bring its four-month layoff total to 30,000.</p>
<p>The biggest reasons cited for January&#39;s planned cutbacks were contract loss (30,784—primarily attributed to UPS) and market and economic conditions (28,392). The data painted a picture of an increasingly stressed labor market, with CNN reporting the job market was already &quot;slim pickings&quot; before the new data made it worse. The January jobs report, which would normally provide additional color on labor market conditions, remains delayed indefinitely due to data collection issues stemming from the recent government shutdown.</p>
<h3>6. Bitcoin Crashes Below $70,000 to 15-Month Low as Crypto Rout Deepens</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin plunged below $70,000 for the first time in 15 months, falling more than 10% in 24 hours as Treasury Secretary Bessent confirmed no federal authority to stabilize crypto markets, triggering $2.58 billion in liquidations and dragging down shares of Coinbase, Circle, and Robinhood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin crashed below $70,000 on Thursday for the first time since November 2024, with the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency falling more than 10% in 24 hours to touch lows near $64,000—a level not seen since October 2024. The decline represents a 44% fall from Bitcoin&#39;s October 2024 peak near $126,000, with cumulative liquidations topping $16 billion over the past 10 days. In the last 24 hours alone, over $2.58 billion in long positions were wiped out as leveraged traders capitulated.</p>
<p>The immediate trigger came from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#39;s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, where he stated that the Treasury has no authority to stabilize crypto markets—dashing hopes among some crypto advocates that the Trump administration might intervene to support digital asset prices. Bitcoin ETFs have also underperformed expectations, with institutional investment declining in recent months and reducing trade volumes. Glassnode analysts recorded the second-largest investor capitulation in two years.</p>
<p>Crypto-related stocks followed Bitcoin lower, with Coinbase dropping to $166 (down 62% from its all-time high), while Circle and Robinhood also declined sharply. The Fear and Greed Index, which reflects investor sentiment, stands at 12 points—indicating &quot;extreme fear&quot; among traders. Analysts noted that Bitcoin has been swept up in broader &quot;risk-off&quot; sentiment flowing through markets, with the cryptocurrency offering no haven from volatility despite years of narrative around its supposed uncorrelated returns.</p>
<h3>7. Peloton Crashes 26% After AI Hardware Bet Backfires</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peloton shares plunged after reporting Q2 fiscal 2026 revenue down 3% year-over-year as its AI-powered hardware refresh—featuring swivel screens and real-time form correction—failed to convince existing users to upgrade, prompting the company to slash full-year guidance and announce CFO departure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peloton shares crashed 26% after the fitness equipment company reported a worse-than-expected holiday quarter, with sales falling to $656.5 million—down about 3% from $673.9 million a year earlier. The company&#39;s Q2 2026 earnings revealed that its Cross Training hardware refresh, featuring swivel screens, 360-degree cameras, and real-time AI form correction, failed to drive the upgrade cycle management had anticipated. Hardware sales of $244 million and subscription revenue of $413 million both missed expectations.</p>
<p>The core problem, management acknowledged, was overestimating the rate at which existing members would upgrade their equipment. The revamped product lineup included artificial intelligence-powered tracking cameras, hands-free control, and enhanced speakers, but shoppers failed to embrace the higher price points during the holiday season. CFO Liz Coddington announced she is leaving Peloton and will stay through March as the company searches for its next finance chief.</p>
<p>Peloton slashed its full-year revenue guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.44 billion, with Q3 guidance of $605 million to $625 million coming in well below the $637 million analyst estimate. The company&#39;s shares closed at $4.39, with some analysts questioning whether Peloton has become a &quot;zombie stock&quot;—dead but not yet aware of it. The failure of the AI hardware strategy represents a significant setback for a company that had positioned the technology refresh as its path back to growth after years of post-pandemic decline.</p>
<h3>8. Tech Selloff Sends S&amp;P 500 Negative for 2026 as Dow Drops 593 Points</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>US equities experienced their worst day in months as the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.23% and turned negative for the year, the Dow shed 593 points, and the Nasdaq declined 1.59%, driven by concerns over AI spending sustainability and dismal labor market data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>US markets suffered a broad selloff Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 592.58 points (1.20%) to close at 48,908.72, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.23% to finish at 6,798.40—pushing the benchmark index into negative territory for 2026. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.59% to 22,540.59, with technology stocks bearing the brunt of selling pressure as investors questioned the sustainability of massive AI spending plans announced by tech giants this earnings season.</p>
<p>The selloff was driven by multiple factors: Alphabet&#39;s announcement of up to $185 billion in 2026 capital expenditures, Qualcomm&#39;s weak forward guidance due to memory shortages, and the Challenger report showing January layoffs at their highest level since 2009. Amazon&#39;s after-hours announcement of $200 billion in 2026 spending suggested the selling pressure would continue. Popular trades in technology and Bitcoin unraveled simultaneously as investors adopted a risk-off stance.</p>
<p>Traders are now eyeing key support levels as the rout deepens, with Bloomberg noting that bottom-fishers are searching for clues on where the selloff may end. The rotation out of technology accelerated, with healthcare and consumer staples providing relative safety. Amgen surged 8.2% on positive earnings, Eli Lilly jumped 10.3%, and healthcare distributor McKesson soared 16.5%—but these gains were overshadowed by the carnage in tech names that have led the market for years.</p>
<h3>9. McKesson Soars 16.5% on Earnings Beat and European Divestiture</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Healthcare distributor McKesson surged after reporting Q3 2026 results with EPS of $9.34 beating estimates, raising full-year guidance to $38.80-$39.20 per share, and completing its strategic exit from Europe through the sale of its Norway businesses to NorgesGruppen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McKesson Corporation shares soared 16.5% on Thursday, opening at $862 and climbing nearly $100 throughout the day to close at $959.31 after the healthcare distributor reported strong fiscal third-quarter 2026 results. The company delivered EPS of $9.34, topping the consensus estimate of $9.19, with total revenue of $106.2 billion representing an 11.4% year-over-year increase. McKesson raised its full-year EPS guidance to $38.80-$39.20, surpassing analyst expectations.</p>
<p>The earnings beat was accompanied by the completion of McKesson&#39;s divestiture of its businesses in Norway to NorgesGruppen, marking the company&#39;s strategic exit from Europe. The move allows McKesson to focus on major growth areas including Oncology and Biopharma, where management sees significant opportunities for margin expansion. Morgan Stanley raised its price target for the company, predicting shares could reach as high as $966.</p>
<p>McKesson&#39;s surge provided a bright spot in an otherwise brutal trading session for the broader market, with healthcare stocks offering a safe haven as technology names cratered. The company&#39;s focus on high-margin specialty distribution, particularly in oncology, positions it to benefit from the continued growth in cancer treatments and biosimilars. The European exit also removes currency exposure and allows management to concentrate capital on the US market, where pharmaceutical distribution remains highly consolidated and profitable.</p>
<h3>10. Oil Prices Slide 2% as US-Iran Talks Ease Supply Disruption Fears</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent crude fell to $67.73 and WTI dropped to $63.47 after Iran and the US confirmed nuclear talks will proceed Friday in Oman, reversing a 3% surge from the prior session when reports suggested negotiations might collapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oil prices fell more than 2% on Thursday after the US and Iran confirmed nuclear talks will proceed in Oman on Friday, with Brent crude futures dropping to $67.73 per barrel and US West Texas Intermediate crude declining to $63.47. The slide erased gains from Wednesday, when prices had surged about 3% on media reports suggesting the planned talks could collapse. Analysts estimate the &quot;geopolitical risk premium&quot; has been adding roughly $7-8 to every barrel of oil, reflecting heightened tensions in the oil-rich Middle East region.</p>
<p>The talks face significant uncertainty over their scope, with Iran seeking to limit discussions strictly to its nuclear program while the US wants to include ballistic missiles, regional proxy groups, and treatment of Iranian citizens during the ongoing protest crackdown. The venue shifted to Oman after the original Turkey location nearly collapsed over format disagreements. A successful de-escalation could eventually bring additional Iranian barrels to market, further pressuring prices already weighed down by expectations of 2026 global oil surplus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, API data showed US crude inventories fell by 11.1 million barrels last week—vastly exceeding expectations of a 0.7 million barrel build and representing the largest draw since June. The surprising drawdown signals tighter domestic supply conditions than anticipated, providing a bullish counterweight to the bearish structural outlook. OPEC+ has reaffirmed plans to keep production unchanged in March, maintaining ample global supply conditions as the cartel monitors the impact of US-Iran negotiations on market dynamics.</p>

<h1>Weekly News Briefing</h1>
<p><strong>Week of:</strong> January 27 - February 3, 2026 | <strong>Research Generated:</strong> Monday, February 3, 2026 9:00 AM PST</p>
<hr>
<h2>Geopolitical News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. New START Nuclear Treaty Expires, Ending 50 Years of Arms Control <em>(Feb 3, 8:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time in over 50 years that no bilateral arms control agreements are in force between the world&#39;s two largest nuclear powers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New START Treaty, signed in 2010, had capped deployed strategic nuclear forces at 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery systems. Russia suspended its participation in 2023 but continued to observe numerical limits. President Putin offered in September 2025 to extend the limits for one more year, but the U.S. never formally responded. President Trump reportedly said of the agreement, &quot;If it expires, it expires.&quot;</p>
<p>The treaty&#39;s expiration raises profound concerns about an unconstrained nuclear build-up. The situation is more complex than the Cold War arms race given China&#39;s nuclear expansion—the Pentagon estimates China&#39;s stockpile has nearly tripled since 2020 to the low 600s and projects 1,000 warheads by 2030. Trump has insisted any future negotiations must include China, which has never been party to strategic arms limits.</p>
<p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock to just 89 seconds to midnight at the start of 2026, the closest ever. Experts warn the prospects for a replacement agreement are extremely low, as meaningful arms control requires trust and communication—neither of which currently exists between Washington and Moscow.</p>
<h3>2. Ukraine-Russia Peace Talks Resume in Abu Dhabi <em>(Feb 1, 10:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Trilateral negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States resumed in Abu Dhabi on February 4-5, following a landmark first round last month that marked the first direct talks since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff held constructive preliminary talks with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev in Florida over the weekend, joined by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Jared Kushner, and White House senior adviser Josh Gruenbaum. Moscow announced the two sides have &quot;narrowed their differences on some issues&quot; though significant disagreements remain.</p>
<p>The fundamental territorial divide remains unresolved. Russia, which occupies approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, is pushing for full control of the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and refuses to sign any deal that fails to deter future Russian aggression. A brief energy infrastructure truce expired Sunday, and Russian drone strikes continued, including one that hit a maternity hospital in southern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukraine claims Russia has suffered more than 1.24 million troop casualties, though such figures are difficult to verify. Combined military casualties on both sides may be approaching two million, making this one of Europe&#39;s deadliest conflicts in decades. Some 43% of Ukrainians don&#39;t believe the war will end in 2026, up 14 points from December.</p>
<h3>3. US-Iran Nuclear Talks Scheduled for Istanbul <em>(Feb 2, 2:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>High-stakes nuclear negotiations between Washington and Tehran are scheduled for Friday, February 6, in Istanbul—the first direct diplomatic engagement since the 12-day war last June that saw Israel attack Iran.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will meet in what could be a pivotal moment for Middle East stability. Turkey is leading the mediation effort, backed by Qatar and Egypt, with foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan, and Oman also invited. President Trump warned of &quot;bad things&quot; if talks fail, while military buildup continues in the region.</p>
<p>The fundamental divide remains: the Trump administration demands any deal cover Iran&#39;s nuclear program, missile program, and regional proxies, while Iran insists only nuclear matters are negotiable. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered his team to pursue &quot;fair and equitable negotiations&quot; in an environment &quot;free from threats and unreasonable expectations.&quot; Foreign Minister Araghchi stated: &quot;We&#39;re ready for diplomacy, but they must understand that diplomacy is not compatible with threats, intimidation or pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>The stakes are enormous. After a previous 60-day deadline passed without agreement, Israel attacked Iran, igniting a full-scale regional war. Supreme Leader Khamenei has warned any U.S. attack would trigger another &quot;regional war.&quot;</p>
<h3>4. EU Designates Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard as Terrorist Organization <em>(Jan 29, 11:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>EU foreign ministers unanimously designated Iran&#39;s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, a landmark decision following the regime&#39;s brutal crackdown on protesters that has killed thousands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>France was the last holdout among the 27-member bloc, shifting its position on January 28 after security forces killed at least 6,000 Iranians in recent weeks—with some officials fearing more than 30,000 dead. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called it a &quot;decisive step.&quot; The United States, Canada, and Australia had already designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Tehran responded furiously, calling the decision &quot;illegal, political and contrary to international law.&quot; In retaliation, Iran declared all EU militaries &quot;terrorist groups&quot; and summoned EU ambassadors to protest. The Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the move as a violation of the country&#39;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>Ukraine also designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization, aligning with the EU. The designation carries significant implications for sanctions, asset freezes, and travel bans targeting IRGC members and affiliated entities across Europe.</p>
<h3>5. Syria Integrates Kurdish Forces Under US-Brokered Deal <em>(Feb 2, 9:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Syrian government forces began deploying to Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast, implementing a U.S.-backed agreement to integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) into state institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deal ends weeks of fighting between Damascus and the SDF following the overthrow of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. About 100 Syrian internal security personnel drove into Kobani, Hasakah, and Qamishli on Monday. Under the agreement, military forces won&#39;t enter Kurdish-majority areas, but security forces will take control of state institutions, airports, and border crossings.</p>
<p>The agreement foresees SDF integration into the Syrian military, including a new division with three SDF brigades. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mustafa said the deal includes transfer of oil fields, Qamishli airport, and border crossings to the government within 10 days. Full implementation is expected within a month.</p>
<p>A January 17 decree by Syria&#39;s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa recognized citizenship rights for Syria&#39;s Kurds—an issue unresolved since the 1960s. President Trump said he was &quot;very happy&quot; with developments after speaking with al-Sharaa. However, experts warn the Kurdish question is &quot;postponed, not ended,&quot; as a durable political settlement remains elusive.</p>
<h3>6. Gaza&#39;s Rafah Crossing Reopens After Two Years <em>(Feb 2, 7:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt partially reopened on Monday for the first time in over two years, allowing limited medical evacuations under the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crossing had been closed since shortly after Hamas&#39;s October 7, 2023 attack. Israel will allow only 50 Palestinians to enter and exit daily—a fraction of what humanitarian groups say is needed. On the first day, only five patients were able to leave, with critics noting there was &quot;no information, no promises&quot; from Israel about expanding access.</p>
<p>The reopening followed the recovery of the last hostage&#39;s remains—police officer Ran Gvili—on January 26, after the IDF exhumed hundreds of bodies and tested around 250 before identification. Since the ceasefire began in October 2025, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel.</p>
<p>Significant tensions persist. According to Gaza&#39;s Government Media Office, Israel violated the ceasefire at least 1,450 times through February 1, including airstrikes that killed over 30 people on Saturday alone. The ceasefire&#39;s second phase confronts thornier issues including a new governance structure and disarming Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades.</p>
<h3>7. Belarusian Balloon Incursions Escalate Hybrid Warfare Against NATO <em>(Jan 30, 4:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dozens of balloons carrying contraband cigarettes from Belarus forced airports to close in Lithuania and Poland, in what NATO officials increasingly describe as a deliberate hybrid warfare campaign by Russia and its ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday night, Lithuanian authorities detected 42 balloon flights, forcing Vilnius airport to halt operations multiple times. The next night, Poland&#39;s eastern airspace was violated. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski accused Belarus of &quot;waging a hybrid war against our country.&quot; Lithuania&#39;s Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene called the incidents &quot;hybrid attacks&quot; and said her country could invoke Article 4 of the NATO treaty.</p>
<p>Lithuania announced it will start shooting down unidentified balloons entering its airspace. Poland deployed anti-drone radar, expanded electronic sensors along its 418-km Belarusian border, and fast-tracked legislation allowing the military to down unidentified aerial objects within a 5-km border buffer. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the alliance &quot;stands in full solidarity with its ally.&quot;</p>
<p>The Belarusian tobacco industry is controlled by Lukashenko&#39;s inner circle. Officials warn: &quot;Who can guarantee that one day instead of cigarettes, there is no bomb, explosive or anything else?&quot; Since October, Vilnius airport has been closed for more than 60 hours due to the balloon threat, affecting over 350 flights and 51,000 passengers. Lukashenko dismissed the concerns as a &quot;mad scam.&quot;</p>
<h3>8. DOJ Releases 3.5 Million Pages of Epstein Files <em>(Jan 30, 12:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Department of Justice released over 3.5 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein files including 2,000+ videos and 180,000 images, completing the legally mandated disclosure under the Epstein Files Transparency Act signed by President Trump in November.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The files cover FBI and DOJ documents, court records, and materials from cases against Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Some documents mention prominent figures including President Trump, former President Clinton, and Elon Musk, though none have been tied to wrongdoing. Howard Lutnick, now Commerce Secretary, was shown to have corresponded with Epstein through intermediaries in 2011-2012.</p>
<p>The release sparked immediate controversy. Attorneys for 200+ alleged victims asked federal judges to order an immediate takedown, calling it &quot;the single most egregious violation of victim privacy in one day in United States history.&quot; Victims&#39; attorneys said the files exposed 43 survivors&#39; unredacted names, including two dozen minors, along with home addresses.</p>
<p>Slovakia&#39;s national security adviser Miroslav Lajčák, a former President of the UN General Assembly, resigned on January 31 after his name appeared in the documents. Deputy AG Todd Blanche said 500+ lawyers worked through weekends and holidays to review more than 6 million pages to decide what to release.</p>
<h3>9. Deadly Mine Collapse Kills 227 in Congo&#39;s Rebel-Controlled Coltan Mines <em>(Jan 31, 6:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A landslide collapsed several tunnels at the Rubaya coltan mines in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killing at least 227 people including miners, children, and market women in one of the deadliest mining disasters in the country&#39;s history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rubaya produces about 15% of the world&#39;s coltan, which is processed into tantalum—a heat-resistant metal essential for mobile phones, computers, aerospace components, and gas turbines. The mine has been controlled by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group since May 2024, generating at least $800,000 monthly in taxes on coltan trade.</p>
<p>Miners dig by hand for a few dollars per day through poorly constructed tunnels with no safe evacuation routes. A former miner told the AP there have been repeated landslides because tunnels aren&#39;t maintained. A survivor explained: &quot;Seeing our peers die is very painful. But despite the pain, we are forced to return to the mines to survive. It has almost become normal.&quot;</p>
<p>The Congolese government accused M23 rebels of illegally and unsafely exploiting natural resources. Rebel authorities temporarily halted artisanal mining near Rubaya, about 50km from Goma. This disaster marks a sharp increase from a June 2025 collapse at the same site that killed 12.</p>
<h3>10. Sudan Airport Reopens as Government Returns to Khartoum <em>(Feb 1, 8:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Sudan Airways operated the first scheduled commercial flight to Khartoum International Airport since the civil war began, as Prime Minister Kamil Idris announced the government&#39;s return to the capital after nearly three years operating from Port Sudan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Airbus A320 carried 160 passengers from Port Sudan, with the airport now able to handle up to four daily flights. The Sudanese military recaptured Khartoum from the Rapid Support Forces in March 2025, and the Central Bank announced resumption of operations in the capital for the first time since fighting began in April 2023.</p>
<p>The military has made significant gains, breaking a two-year RSF siege of Dilling town in South Kordofan and recapturing several other strategic positions. However, the RSF still controls most of Darfur and parts of Kordofan. RSF forces continue attacks, including a drone strike that killed dozens in South Kordofan last week.</p>
<p>The conflict has created the world&#39;s largest displacement and hunger crisis, with over 100,000 killed and 14 million displaced. A UN-monitored ceasefire proposal calling for RSF withdrawal and reintegration of fighters was rejected by the paramilitary group. Experts assess continued conflict is the most likely scenario throughout 2026.</p>
<h3>11. US Government Shutdown Enters Fifth Day, Jobs Report Delayed <em>(Jan 31, 3:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A partial government shutdown affecting eight federal departments stretched into its fifth day as House Republicans worked to clear procedural hurdles, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics unable to release the January jobs report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shutdown was sparked by an impasse over immigration enforcement funding following fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis. Democrats demanded DHS funding be stripped from the package after Border Patrol agents killed two U.S. citizens, Alex Pretti and Renée Good, in incidents where eyewitness video contradicted official accounts.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 FAA workers were furloughed and 14,000 air traffic controllers worked without pay. The Labor Department saw furloughs of nearly three-quarters of staff, leaving the BLS unable to compile employment data. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence the shutdown would end by Tuesday after key Republican holdouts dropped opposition following a White House meeting.</p>
<p>The partial shutdown differs from previous full government closures—Congress had already passed half the year&#39;s funding bills, ensuring nutrition assistance and other critical programs continued. However, the delayed jobs report adds uncertainty to Fed policy assessments at a critical time for monetary decisions.</p>
<h3>12. Kendrick Lamar Dominates Grammys with Five Wins <em>(Feb 1, 11:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Kendrick Lamar won five Grammy Awards including Record of the Year for &quot;Luther&quot; featuring SZA, surpassing Jay-Z to become the most-awarded hip-hop artist in Grammy history, while Bad Bunny&#39;s &quot;Debí Tirar Más Fotos&quot; became the first Spanish-language Album of the Year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lamar, who had the most nominations with nine, swept the rap categories: Best Rap Album for &quot;GNX,&quot; Best Rap Song for &quot;tv off,&quot; Best Melodic Rap Performance for &quot;luther,&quot; and Best Rap Performance for &quot;Chains &amp; Whips.&quot; His fourth five-win Grammy night was his second consecutive Record of the Year, and &quot;GNX&quot; was his fifth straight studio album nominated for Album of the Year—an unprecedented feat.</p>
<p>Bad Bunny&#39;s historic Album of the Year win made him just the third Latino artist to receive the honor and the first for a Spanish-language album. Other notable winners included Billie Eilish for Song of the Year (&quot;Wildflower&quot;), Olivia Dean for Best New Artist, and Lady Gaga for Best Pop Vocal Album (&quot;Mayhem&quot;).</p>
<p>The ceremony also featured political moments, with artists criticizing ICE and immigration enforcement policies. The event took place at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with host Trevor Noah returning for the fourth time.</p>
<h3>13. Carlos Alcaraz Completes Career Grand Slam at Australian Open <em>(Feb 1, 5:30 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Spain&#39;s Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 to win his first Australian Open title, becoming the youngest man in tennis history to complete the career Grand Slam at 22 years, 8 months, and 27 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alcaraz broke Rafael Nadal&#39;s 16-year record of youngest career Slam completion (24 years, 101 days). After a flat opening set where Djokovic came out firing, the Spaniard locked in from the baseline to take control. He broke decisively in the 12th game of the fourth set to seal a three-hour, two-minute victory.</p>
<p>The win ended Djokovic&#39;s unbeaten 10-0 record in Australian Open finals. At 38 years and 255 days, Djokovic became the oldest man in tournament history to reach the final, but his wait for an all-time record 25th Grand Slam title continues. Alcaraz&#39;s seventh major puts him alongside John McEnroe and Mats Wilander on the all-time list.</p>
<p>The semifinal between Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev was the longest Australian Open semifinal at 5 hours 27 minutes. Meanwhile, Djokovic&#39;s semifinal victory over two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner was an instant classic that the Serbian called &quot;one of my best performances in the last decade.&quot;</p>
<h3>14. Iran Protests Continue Amid Brutal Crackdown <em>(Jan 29, 9:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Iranian protesters continue gathering in Tehran and other cities despite a deadly crackdown by security forces that human rights organizations say has killed at least 6,000 people, with some European officials fearing the toll exceeds 30,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The protests erupted in response to government policies and have been met with extreme brutality, particularly by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Evidence gathered by human rights organizations documents systematic use of lethal force against demonstrators. Three women shared stories of resistance, fear, and hope for freedom as the movement persists despite the violent suppression.</p>
<p>The crackdown prompted the EU&#39;s historic decision to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization on January 29, joining the U.S., Canada, and Australia. The designation was a direct response to the regime&#39;s violence against its own citizens and carries significant implications for sanctions and asset freezes targeting IRGC members.</p>
<p>The protests represent one of the most significant challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 2022 uprising following the death of Mahsa Amini. International pressure is mounting as evidence of atrocities accumulates, though the regime shows no signs of moderating its response.</p>
<h3>15. Trump Threatens Canada with 100% Tariffs Over China Trade Deal <em>(Jan 31, 2:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada after Ottawa negotiated a deal with China to lower tariffs on electric vehicles in exchange for reduced taxes on Canadian farm products, escalating tensions with America&#39;s northern ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latest tariff threat came days after Trump announced he would hit Canada&#39;s aircraft imports with 50% duties and decertify new jets from Bombardier, claiming Canada uses certification hurdles to effectively ban U.S. Gulfstream jets. The trade war between the two allies has intensified throughout 2025, with the average effective U.S. tariff rate reaching 16.8% by November.</p>
<p>Mexico is also facing tariff pressure. President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will seek alternate ways to help Cuba after Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on nations supplying Cuba with oil—Mexico being one of the last to do so.</p>
<p>Courts have consistently ruled against Trump&#39;s tariff authority, with the Court of International Trade declaring the &quot;fentanyl&quot; tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico invalid in May 2025. However, the administration has appealed these rulings. U.S. tariff revenue reached $287 billion in 2025—a 192% increase from 2024—while corporate bankruptcies rose to the highest level since 2010.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Silver Crashes 36% in Worst Day Since 1980 <em>(Jan 31, 10:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Silver plummeted 36% from record highs to $78.29 per ounce in the worst single-day drop since the Hunt Brothers collapse in 1980, while gold crashed 21% from $5,600 to below $4,400, erasing approximately $15 trillion from precious metals markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The historic selloff was triggered by President Trump&#39;s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair, which markets interpreted as a signal of continued central bank independence and tight monetary policy. The &quot;Warsh Shock&quot; sent the dollar rallying and sparked massive profit-taking after gold and silver had surged 65% and 145% respectively in 2025.</p>
<p>CME Group raised margin requirements—gold to 8% from 6%, silver to 15% from 11%—forcing leveraged speculators out when volatility spiked. Wild price swings meant banks struggled to trade with investors as holding positions became too risky. &quot;Once their willingness to quote prices in size faded, liquidity deteriorated further and volatility blew out,&quot; analysts explained.</p>
<p>Despite the crash, major banks maintain bullish targets: JPMorgan sees $6,300 gold, UBS targets $6,200, Deutsche Bank projects $6,000 by year-end. Gold remains up 8% year-to-date even after the correction. Central bank demand remains structurally strong as countries diversify away from dollar assets.</p>
<h3>2. Bitcoin Crashes to 10-Month Lows Below $75,000 <em>(Feb 1, 8:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin tumbled to approximately $74,500, its lowest level since April 2025, marking a 40% decline from its October peak of $126,000 and triggering $2.5 billion in cryptocurrency liquidations over 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than 580,000 traders saw positions liquidated in 48 hours, with over 90% being long positions. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index plunged to 18 (&quot;Extreme Fear&quot;). Bitcoin&#39;s market depth dropped 30% below its October peak—the lowest since the FTX collapse. January marked the cryptocurrency&#39;s fourth straight monthly decline, the longest losing streak since 2018.</p>
<p>The crash coincided with the broader precious metals meltdown following the Warsh Fed nomination and the Federal Reserve&#39;s decision to pause rate cuts. Bitcoin fell nearly 11% in January alone. Ethereum plunged nearly one-fifth of its value over the week while Solana&#39;s price was cut in half.</p>
<p>Forecasts range wildly from $40,000 to $200,000. Analyst Paul Howard stated: &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2026.&quot; John Blank at Zacks suggested bitcoin could hit $40,000 this year. The broader crypto market remains highly correlated with bitcoin, confirming it &quot;still dances to BTC&#39;s tune.&quot;</p>
<h3>3. S&amp;P 500 Rebounds to Record High Amid Volatility <em>(Feb 2, 4:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% to a fresh record high on Monday, with the Dow gaining 515 points (+1.1%) to 49,407 and the Nasdaq advancing 0.6% as stocks recovered from last week&#39;s precious metals and crypto turmoil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Top performers included Caterpillar (+5.05%), Walmart (+4.14%), and Apple (+4.06%). Asian markets bounced with MSCI Asia Pacific jumping 2.4%—its best day since April. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.37% year-to-date, with energy leading sectors at 14.37% thanks to rising oil prices amid geopolitical turbulence and icy U.S. weather.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs projects the S&amp;P 500 to produce 12% total return in 2026, forecasting EPS growth of 12% with profit margins expanding 70 basis points. Bank of America targets 7,100 (3.7% upside), while Deutsche Bank sees 8,000 (17% upside) by year-end. Not a single surveyed analyst predicts a decline. If realized, 2026 would mark the fourth straight year of gains—the longest winning streak in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>However, valuations remain historically elevated, with the forward P/E at 22x versus a 30-year average of 17. The equity risk premium stands at just 0.02%—among the lowest on record—highlighting a market environment &quot;largely devoid of a margin of safety.&quot;</p>
<h3>4. Fed Holds Rates at 3.50%-3.75%; Warsh Nominated as Next Chair <em>(Jan 30, 2:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 3.50%-3.75% at its first meeting of 2026, while President Trump nominated hawkish former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell when his term ends in May.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governors Miran and Waller voted for a 25-basis-point cut, but the majority held firm. Chair Powell indicated cuts remain likely but only after tariff-related inflation effects prove temporary. The Fed is positioned to remain on hold through at least the first half of 2026. Analysts expect GDP growth around 2% with core inflation moderating to 2.7%.</p>
<p>The Warsh nomination triggered historic precious metals volatility as markets interpreted it as a signal of continued central bank independence and hawkish policy. Warsh served as Fed Governor from 2006-2011 during the Global Financial Crisis and is seen as a tight-money advocate. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett believes more rate cuts could eventually come with Warsh at the helm.</p>
<p>Senator Thom Tillis has vowed to block nominees until a Fed building renovation investigation is resolved, potentially delaying confirmation. Goldman Sachs projects US growth at 2.6% versus consensus 2.0%, citing reduced tariff drag, tax cuts, and easier financial conditions.</p>
<h3>5. Palantir Surges on Blowout AI-Driven Earnings <em>(Feb 2, 5:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Technologies jumped 11% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that crushed expectations, with revenue surging 70% year-over-year to $1.41 billion as government and commercial clients race to adopt its artificial intelligence tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defense tech company reported adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share versus 23 cents expected. U.S. commercial sales jumped 137%, while government segment revenue grew 66%. CEO Alex Karp highlighted the ongoing adoption by the U.S. government as AI becomes central to defense and intelligence operations.</p>
<p>For fiscal 2026, Palantir guided to $7.18-7.20 billion in revenue, dramatically beating the $6.22 billion consensus estimate. The company forecast $1.53 billion in current quarter sales. The results were so strong that Jefferies analysts warned of &quot;tougher comps ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>Palantir&#39;s performance helped ignite a broader rally in technology stocks. The company&#39;s success reflects the accelerating enterprise AI adoption trend, with the four hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—boosting combined capex to $470 billion from $350 billion in 2025.</p>
<h3>6. Oil Prices Plunge 5% on US-Iran Talk Optimism <em>(Feb 2, 11:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>WTI crude fell more than 5% to $61.70 per barrel while Brent dropped to $65.92 as diplomatic progress with Iran reduced fears of Middle East supply disruptions, unwinding January&#39;s 14-16% rally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump confirmed Iran was &quot;seriously talking&quot; with the U.S., with nuclear negotiations scheduled for Friday in Istanbul. Iranian officials also signaled openness to diplomacy, helping calm markets that had priced in conflict risk. OPEC+ reaffirmed plans to keep output unchanged in March, with eight member countries pausing production increases.</p>
<p>The EIA forecasts Brent averaging $56 per barrel in 2026—19% below 2025 levels. The World Bank warned of a &quot;massive oil glut&quot; expected to reach 3 million barrels per day by year-end. Brent and WTI recorded annual losses of nearly 20% in 2025, the steepest since 2020 and the third straight year of losses for Brent—the longest such streak on record.</p>
<p>OPEC+ faces an uphill battle against structural oversupply. The eight participating countries reiterated that 1.65 million barrels per day may be returned &quot;subject to evolving market conditions&quot; in a gradual manner.</p>
<h3>7. Natural Gas Plunges 20%+ in Single Session <em>(Feb 2, 1:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The March natural gas contract dropped more than 20% in midday trading as weather patterns shifted and supply concerns eased, extending the extreme volatility that has characterized commodity markets this week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Natural Gas Fund (UNG) tumbled correspondingly. The dramatic move came after an extended rally driven by the polar vortex that brought freezing temperatures across the United States. The plunge underscored the extreme volatility in commodities alongside gold, silver, and crypto swings.</p>
<p>Energy sector performance remained strong overall despite the single-session gas crash. Energy led January sector returns at 14.37%, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 1.37% gain. Materials took second place, followed by defensive consumer staples.</p>
<p>The gas market&#39;s wild swing reflects the broader theme of 2026&#39;s opening weeks: massive volatility across asset classes driven by policy uncertainty, weather, and shifting geopolitical dynamics.</p>
<h3>8. Jobs Report Delayed Indefinitely Due to Government Shutdown <em>(Feb 2, 9:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced it cannot release the January employment report as scheduled February 6, adding uncertainty to Federal Reserve policy assessments at a critical moment for monetary decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BLS employees are furloughed and cannot collect or compile data. The release will be rescheduled upon funding resumption, though the timing remains uncertain as the partial shutdown extends. Nearly three-quarters of Labor Department staff received furlough notices.</p>
<p>December&#39;s report showed only 50,000 jobs added with downward revisions removing 76,000 from prior months. Unemployment fell to 4.4%. The data gap complicates Fed decision-making as policymakers try to assess the labor market&#39;s health amid tariff uncertainty and inflation concerns.</p>
<p>The delayed jobs report is one of several economic impacts from the shutdown, which affects Defense, Labor, HHS, Education, Transportation, HUD, State, and Treasury departments. Markets are navigating without key economic data at a time of heightened volatility.</p>
<h3>9. Tech Giants Pledge $470B in AI Capex for 2026 <em>(Jan 30, 3:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The four major cloud hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—announced combined 2026 capital expenditure plans of $470 billion, up from $350 billion in 2025, as AI infrastructure buildout accelerates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion this year through debt and equity financing to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity for its largest OCI customers including AMD and Meta. The company is selling $25 billion in investment-grade bonds as part of the effort.</p>
<p>Microsoft shed 7.7% on increasing capex and marginally disappointing Azure cloud growth. Meta rallied 8.8% after raising its 2026 sales projection. Nvidia fell 2.9% on uncertainty over its stalled $100 billion OpenAI investment, though analysts remain bullish on $500 billion chip revenue visibility.</p>
<p>Fidelity International calls AI &quot;the defining theme for equity markets&quot; in 2026. BlackRock Investment Institute says the tech will &quot;keep trumping tariffs and traditional macro drivers.&quot; However, some analysts question whether the massive spending will deliver returns, noting 167 S&amp;P 500 companies have reported Q4 earnings with results 5% above consensus.</p>
<h3>10. US Trade Deficit Nearly Doubles to $56.8 Billion <em>(Jan 28, 10:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The goods and services trade deficit surged from $29.2 billion in October to $56.8 billion in November as exports decreased and imports increased, raising questions about the effectiveness of tariff policies aimed at reducing trade imbalances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The widening gap came despite the Trump administration&#39;s aggressive tariff regime, which has pushed the average effective U.S. tariff rate to 16.8%. The November data predates the latest round of tariff escalations and trade deal announcements.</p>
<p>U.S. tariff revenue reached $287 billion in 2025, a 192% increase from 2024. However, the promised growth in manufacturing jobs has not materialized, and corporate bankruptcies rose to the highest level since 2010. Multiple courts have ruled against the administration&#39;s tariff authority, though appeals continue.</p>
<p>Analysts expect continued volatility in trade data as new agreements take effect. The China-U.S. trade truce saw Beijing lift rare earth export restrictions in November, while the US-India deal announced February 2 promises $500 billion in Indian purchases of American goods.</p>
<h3>11. India Markets Surge on US Trade Deal <em>(Feb 2, 6:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nifty 50 jumped nearly 5% and the rupee strengthened to 90.40—its best day since November 2022—after President Trump announced a landmark trade agreement reducing tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty-seven of 30 Sensex stocks traded positive as trade war fears eased. The 18% U.S. tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors. Indian companies committed to over $500 billion in American purchases across energy, technology, agriculture, and coal. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal called it the &quot;father of all deals.&quot;</p>
<p>India pledged to halt Russian oil purchases and &quot;BUY AMERICAN&quot; at significantly higher levels. However, analysts cautioned that legally binding text still needs to materialize. Prime Minister Modi notably did not mention Russian oil or tariff elimination in his response to Trump&#39;s announcement.</p>
<p>Questions remain about congressional approval requirements and implementation timeline. The deal ended a year-long tariff standoff between the two nations and represents a major diplomatic and economic realignment.</p>
<h3>12. Gold Banks Maintain $6,000+ Targets Despite Historic Crash <em>(Feb 2, 10:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>JPMorgan, UBS, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale maintained bullish gold price forecasts despite last week&#39;s 21% crash, citing unchanged fundamental drivers including central bank demand and dollar diversification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JPMorgan targets $6,300 per ounce, UBS raised its forecast to $6,200 with a $7,200 upside scenario. Deutsche Bank and SocGen project $6,000 by year-end. The World Bank forecasts precious metals rising 5% in 2026 overall.</p>
<p>Gold remains up 8% year-to-date and 69% year-over-year even after the correction. Spot gold recovered to around $4,938 per ounce on Tuesday after hitting lows near $4,400. Analysts described the crash as &quot;a positioning reset rather than a sustained downturn.&quot;</p>
<p>Central bank demand remains structurally strong as countries diversify away from dollar assets. The gold-to-silver ratio hit extreme levels during the crash, suggesting silver may have overcorrected. Trader Peter Brandt expects a snap-back rally before another wave lower &quot;that washes out speculators.&quot;</p>
<h3>13. US Manufacturing Expands for First Time in 12 Months <em>(Feb 2, 10:30 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Factory activity in January expanded for the first time in a year, with the ISM Manufacturing Index showing surges in new orders and production that signal potential economic resilience despite tariff uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expansion ended the longest manufacturing contraction streak since the 2008 financial crisis. Transport stocks hit new all-time highs with the Dow Jones Transportation Average up 2%, led by United Airlines, Old Dominion, and Delta.</p>
<p>Energy sector led January performance at 14.37%, followed by materials and consumer staples. Health care, info tech, and financials ended January lower. The sector rotation away from growth stocks reflects geopolitical turbulence driving commodity prices.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs expects the U.S. to substantially outperform global growth forecasts (2.6% vs. 2.0% consensus) due to reduced tariff drag, tax cuts, and easier financial conditions. Analysts see the manufacturing rebound as a positive signal for the industrial economy.</p>
<h3>14. ECB Expected to Hold Rates at February Meeting <em>(Feb 2, 7:00 AM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at 2% when it meets February 4-5, with analysts forecasting the ECB to remain on hold for most of 2026 amid stable inflation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ECB left borrowing costs unchanged for a fourth consecutive meeting in December, with the main refinancing rate at 2.15% and deposit facility rate at 2%. Swap markets price in stable rates through most of 2026 with a marginal uptick in implied rates for December.</p>
<p>&quot;Our baseline forecast is for the ECB to keep rates at 2% throughout 2026, with a stance that we consider neutral,&quot; said Josefina Rodriguez at Vanguard. However, falling energy prices and inflation remaining below target suggest the stance tilts toward easing rather than tightening.</p>
<p>The Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia also meet this week. Markets anticipate over 70% probability the RBA will raise rates to 3.85% following surprisingly robust employment data and persistent inflation challenges in Australia.</p>
<h3>15. S&amp;P 500 Valuation Concerns at 22x Forward P/E <em>(Feb 2, 3:00 PM)</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22x—well above its 30-year average of 17—raising correction risk even as analysts unanimously project positive returns for 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The median Wall Street forecast puts the S&amp;P 500 at 7,600 by year-end, representing roughly 10% upside. Notably, not a single surveyed analyst predicts a decline. If realized, 2026 would mark the fourth straight year of gains—the longest winning streak in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>The equity risk premium stands at just 0.02%—among the lowest on record—as the S&amp;P 500&#39;s forward earnings yield sits near parity with the 10-year Treasury. This highlights what analysts call a market environment &quot;largely devoid of a margin of safety.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Goldman Sachs, the biggest risks are weaker than expected economic growth or a hawkish Fed shift, though &quot;neither appears likely in the near future.&quot; The firm expects EPS to increase 12% in 2026 and 10% in 2027 with profit margins expanding 70 basis points.</p>

<h2>Fusion Energy</h2>
<h3>General Fusion Sets World Record with 600 Million Neutrons Per Second - <em>Jan 28, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Canadian company General Fusion achieves highest neutron output ever recorded for Magnetized Target Fusion, validated by IAEA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion, a Canadian company specializing in nuclear fusion technology, has set a world record by generating 600 million neutrons per second using Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF). This achievement was recognized and validated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and represents a crucial step toward demonstrating the viability of nuclear fusion as a sustainable and scalable energy source.</p>
<p>During compression, the plasma density rose to about 190 times the starting value and the magnetic field that holds it in place grew more than 13 times stronger, while the plasma stayed stable instead of tearing itself apart and delivered repeatable bursts of fusion neutrons. What sets General Fusion&#39;s method apart from traditional fusion techniques is its unique approach involving a liquid metal liner, where high-powered pistons compress the liquid metal mechanically, rapidly compressing plasma within a spherical tokamak.</p>
<p>Dr. Michel Laberge, founder and Chief Scientist of General Fusion, stated: &quot;This is the first-ever compression of a spherical tokamak using a collapsing metal liner. These results strengthen MTF as a viable path to commercial fusion energy.&quot; The results come from the long-running Plasma Compression Science experiment series, whose data have been reviewed by independent scientists and published in the journal Nuclear Fusion. The lessons from these experiments feed directly into Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), the larger demonstration device the company has built in Richmond, British Columbia.</p>
<h3>General Fusion Announces $1 Billion SPAC Merger, First Pure-Play Fusion IPO - <em>Feb 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General Fusion becomes first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion through SPAC deal, signaling growing investor confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion is set to become the first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion, signaling growing investor confidence in the field. The company has agreed to merge with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. III in a roughly $1 billion SPAC deal announced January 21, 2026.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s piston-driven, liquid-lithium approach challenges magnet- and laser-based fusion designs while aiming to reduce material degradation. Instead of using powerful magnets or lasers, the model uses mechanical pistons to contain plasma within a liquid lithium shell, offering a potentially more practical path to commercial fusion power.</p>
<p>This IPO represents a watershed moment for the fusion industry, which has collectively raised over $7.1 billion to date. Commonwealth Fusion Systems leads funding at nearly $3 billion following its $863 million Series B2 in August 2025, but General Fusion&#39;s public offering opens a new avenue for retail and institutional investors to participate in the fusion energy revolution.</p>
<h3>China&#39;s EAST Tokamak Achieves &quot;Density-Free Regime&quot; Breakthrough - <em>Jan 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese scientists break through the long-theorized plasma density limit, removing a major obstacle toward fusion ignition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists working with China&#39;s fully superconducting Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) have successfully reached a long-theorized &quot;density-free regime&quot; in fusion plasma experiments. In this groundbreaking state, the plasma remains stable even when its density rises far beyond traditional limits that have constrained tokamak operations for decades.</p>
<p>The experiment, published in Science Advances, confirmed that plasma can remain stable even at extreme densities if its interaction with the reactor walls is carefully controlled. This finding effectively removes the Greenwald density limit, a major obstacle that has slowed progress toward practical fusion energy generation for years. Using a newly developed high-density operating approach on EAST, the team showed that plasma density can be pushed well beyond long-accepted empirical limits without triggering violent instabilities.</p>
<p>The breakthrough demonstrates that with proper wall conditioning and plasma control techniques, tokamaks can operate at much higher performance levels than previously thought possible, bringing commercial fusion power closer to reality. This research could fundamentally change how future fusion reactors are designed and operated.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan Strategic Fusion Partnership Launched - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering establish collaboration to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate commercialization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering launched a strategic partnership to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate deployment of commercial fusion power. The agreement could serve as a model for joint public-private investment and international collaboration to develop fusion technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Collaboration between U.S. and U.K. research teams has already yielded crucial findings. Both machines confirmed that energy confinement scales more favorably to the expected operating regime in fusion pilot plants in spherical tokamaks than in conventional designs—a finding that could determine the shape of future commercial fusion plants.</p>
<p>This international cooperation reflects growing recognition that fusion energy development benefits from shared resources and expertise across borders. With multiple countries racing toward commercial fusion, partnerships like this one help distribute both the costs and the knowledge gained from cutting-edge experiments.</p>
<h3>Commonwealth Fusion Systems Partners with NVIDIA and Siemens for AI-Powered Development - <em>Jan 6, 8:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CFS announces partnership leveraging AI-powered digital twins to compress years of fusion experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems has announced a major partnership with NVIDIA and Siemens to accelerate the development of commercial fusion energy using artificial intelligence. The collaboration will create AI-powered digital twins of fusion systems to dramatically speed up the development process.</p>
<p>&quot;CFS will be able to compress years of manual experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization using the digital infrastructure developed by NVIDIA and Siemens,&quot; said Bob Mumgaard, Co-Founder and CEO of CFS. Leveraging data from Siemens and an AI platform from Nvidia, CFS is creating what it calls a &quot;digital twin&quot; of its demonstration machine to speed progress toward commercial fusion.</p>
<p>CFS aims to hit a key technical milestone in 2027—generating net energy at its SPARC demonstration reactor in Massachusetts—before producing commercial-scale fusion energy in the early 2030s. The company has raised nearly $3 billion to date, making it the best-funded private fusion venture in the world.</p>

<h2>Human Genetics &amp; Gene Science</h2>
<h3>First Patient Dosed with CRISPR Epigenetic Silencer for Hepatitis B - <em>Jan 30, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio begins Phase 1/2 trial of CRMA-1001, a CRISPR-derived therapy that silences hepatitis B virus without cutting the genome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio has dosed the first patient with CRMA-1001, an innovative CRISPR-Cas–derived epigenetic silencer designed to treat chronic hepatitis B infection. Unlike traditional gene editing, this therapy methylates viral DNA without making cuts to the genome, representing a fundamentally new approach to treating viral diseases.</p>
<p>The open-label Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and antiviral durability of the treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Regulatory approvals have enabled the study to expand to the UK and New Zealand, broadening the international scope of this promising research. CRMA-1001 specifically targets HBV cccDNA and integrated viral DNA, aiming to achieve a functional cure by silencing the virus&#39;s ability to replicate.</p>
<p>This represents a new paradigm in treating viral infections, using precision epigenetic tools to silence viral genes while leaving the host genome intact. With approximately 296 million people living with chronic hepatitis B worldwide, a functional cure could transform global public health outcomes for this persistent viral infection.</p>
<h3>CRISPR Breakthrough: Turning Genes On Without Cutting DNA - <em>Jan 4, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists develop safer gene therapy approach using epigenetic editing to reactivate silenced genes without making permanent cuts to DNA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists at UNSW Sydney have developed a revolutionary new form of CRISPR technology that can turn genes back on without cutting DNA. Instead of making permanent edits to the genetic code, this approach removes chemical tags (methyl groups) that act like molecular anchors, silencing genes.</p>
<p>The work confirms that these epigenetic tags actively silence genes, settling a long-running scientific debate in the field. Rather than cutting DNA, the new technique uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups, releasing the genetic brakes that keep certain genes switched off. One key target is the fetal globin gene, which helps deliver oxygen before birth.</p>
<p>Reactivating the fetal globin gene after birth could help bypass defects in the adult globin gene that cause Sickle Cell disease. Scientists say this breakthrough opens the door to powerful new therapies with fewer unintended side effects, potentially transforming the gene therapy landscape and making treatments accessible to more patients who currently have limited options.</p>
<h3>Personalized CRISPR Therapy Team Plans Landmark Clinical Trial - <em>Jan 28, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers behind KJ Muldoon&#39;s historic treatment plan new trial type that could treat multiple rare diseases with as few as 5-10 patients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team behind the world&#39;s first personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy is planning an entirely new type of clinical trial to make this technology more accessible to patients with rare diseases. Researchers at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine created a bespoke in vivo CRISPR therapy for infant KJ Muldoon in just six months.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to launch a clinical trial in 2026 that can enroll patients with any of 7 different urea cycle disorders, caused by any variant in any of 7 genes that can be corrected by the same type of gene editor used in KJ&#39;s therapy. Successful treatment of a small number of participants—as few as 5-10—might be sufficient for FDA approval.</p>
<p>This landmark case paves the way for a future with on-demand gene-editing therapies for individuals with rare, until-now untreatable genetic diseases. The approach could fundamentally change how rare disease treatments are developed and approved, making personalized medicine a reality for thousands of patients with ultra-rare conditions.</p>
<h3>CRISPR CAR-T Therapy Shows 70% Complete Response in Cancer Trials - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy zugo-cel achieves remarkable results in B-cell lymphoma and autoimmune disease trials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy, zugo-cel (CTX112), is showing remarkable early promise in clinical trials for both autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), a 100M-cell dose induced rapid B-cell depletion and clinical improvement.</p>
<p>Importantly, the therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) observed. In relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma patients, a higher 600M-cell dose achieved an impressive complete response rate of 70%.</p>
<p>These results position zugo-cel as a potential breakthrough in both oncology and autoimmune disease treatment, with the allogeneic (off-the-shelf) approach potentially making CAR-T therapy accessible to far more patients than current autologous approaches that require manufacturing cells from each individual patient.</p>
<h3>iECURE&#39;s Gene Editing Treatment Receives Dual Fast-Track Designations - <em>Jan 21, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ECUR-506 secures both FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation and UK Innovation Passport for treating neonatal conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>iECURE&#39;s ECUR-506 gene editing treatment has received significant regulatory recognition, securing both the US FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation and a UK Innovation Passport. These designations will accelerate the development pathway for this promising therapy targeting severe neonatal conditions.</p>
<p>The treatment targets severe neonatal conditions where early intervention is critical. The dual regulatory fast-tracking demonstrates international recognition of the therapy&#39;s potential to address unmet medical needs in some of the most vulnerable patient populations.</p>
<p>RMAT designation provides intensive FDA guidance, eligibility for priority review, and potential accelerated approval, while the UK Innovation Passport offers similar benefits in the British regulatory system, positioning ECUR-506 for rapid global development. This dual recognition underscores growing momentum for gene editing therapies treating conditions that were previously considered untreatable.</p>

<h2>Inflation &amp; Finance Metrics</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady in Split Decision Amid Political Pressure - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The FOMC voted 10-2 to keep interest rates at 3.50%-3.75%, ending a string of three consecutive quarter-point cuts as Chair Powell described the economy as on &quot;firm footing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, January 28, marking the central bank&#39;s first pause since July 2025. The decision came after three consecutive quarter-point reductions delivered between September and December 2025, which Powell characterized as having moved policy toward a &quot;neutral&quot; range. Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented from the decision, favoring continued cuts.</p>
<p>In his post-meeting press conference, Chair Jerome Powell stated that &quot;if you look at the incoming data since the last meeting, there is clear improvement in the outlook for growth. Inflation performed about as expected, and some of the labor market data came in suggesting evidence of stabilization.&quot; Powell noted there was &quot;broad support on the Committee for holding today,&quot; including among non-voting members, though some wanted to continue cutting.</p>
<p>Futures markets now expect at most two quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2026, with the first anticipated in June and a second in the fall, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The decision comes as President Trump announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would replace Powell when his term ends in May.</p>
<h3>Government Shutdown Delays Key January Jobs Report - <em>Feb 2, 10:30 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the January employment report will not be released as scheduled on February 6 after lawmakers failed to reach funding agreement following controversial DHS enforcement actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government partially shut down on January 31 after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding, an impasse sparked by outcry over the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota—specifically the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6.</p>
<p>In addition to the January jobs report, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) release for December 2025 and the Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for December 2025 will also be rescheduled. The BLS stated that &quot;due to the partial federal government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will suspend data collection, processing, and dissemination.&quot;</p>
<p>Signs from Capitol Hill suggest this shutdown will be brief—unlike the 43-day shutdown that concluded November 12. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he anticipates passing funding legislation early this week. Unlike in last year&#39;s shutdown, which resulted in major inflation and unemployment data going uncollected for October, the relevant data has already been collected. Economists had expected the January jobs report to show employers added 80,000 jobs last month, up from 50,000 in December.</p>
<h3>Tariff Costs Set to Hit Consumers Harder as Businesses Pass Along Price Increases - <em>Jan 30, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After absorbing roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, businesses are now passing those costs to consumers, with the figure expected to flip to just 20% business absorption later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump&#39;s tariffs are increasingly impacting consumer prices as businesses exhaust their pretariff inventory and begin passing costs to shoppers. According to JPMorgan analysis, businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that ratio could shrink to just 20% later this year as companies implement further price hikes. Goldman Sachs economists estimated that tariffs caused inflation to increase by half a percentage point in 2025.</p>
<p>According to NBER research, since President Trump announced broad tariff measures starting in the spring, the import taxes increased the inflation rate by 0.7 percentage points between March and August. The annual inflation rate for August—which was 2.9%—would have been 2.2% without tariffs. Before Trump took office, the U.S. average effective tariff rate was 2.4%, according to estimates from the Yale Budget Lab. At the end of 2025, it was 16.8%.</p>
<p>Consumer goods with the steepest price increases since Trump took office tend to be those with lower profit margins. Prices of heavily imported items—including tomatoes and coffee—have changed more significantly than most other goods. The United States collected $187 billion more in tariff revenue in 2025 than it did in 2024, a nearly 200% increase. According to Budget Lab research, tariffs represent an income loss of $1,700 for the average U.S. household.</p>
<h3>Warren Report: Households Paid $2,120 More Due to Inflation in 2025 - <em>Jan 30, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Warren&#39;s team found year-on-year inflation equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, with lower-income families facing costs exceeding 5% of their income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren released a report through the Senate Banking Committee detailing how households paid an estimated $2,120 more in 2025 because of inflation—including an estimated $123 more on electricity bills and an estimated $150 more for groceries. The year-on-year inflation increase equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, assuming they purchased the same goods and services in 2025 that they bought in 2024.</p>
<p>Higher prices have fallen hardest on those least able to afford them. In 2025, the bottom 20% of households faced roughly $950 in additional inflation-related costs—more than 5% of their estimated income. In contrast, although the top 20% paid more in absolute dollars, those costs amounted to just 2% of their estimated income. The report documents sharp price increases for everyday grocery staples, including coffee and beef prices, which are up a respective 29% and 21% since January 2025.</p>
<p>The report comes as the annual inflation rate in the United States was 2.7% for the 12 months ending December, according to U.S. Labor Department data released on January 13, 2026. While inflation is off its 40-year highs from 2022, the rate is still running closer to 3% than the Fed&#39;s 2% goal, causing concern among some FOMC officials who either want rate cuts paused or eliminated until there&#39;s more evidence that price increases are easing.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Case Threatens Fed Independence as Powell Calls It &quot;Most Important&quot; in 113 Years - <em>Jan 21, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments in the Lisa Cook case, while separately facing DOJ subpoenas over building renovations that he characterizes as &quot;pretexts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments on January 21 in a landmark case addressing whether President Donald Trump can fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell called the case &quot;perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed&#39;s 113-year history,&quot; adding that &quot;as I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn&#39;t attend.&quot; The case tests the legal boundaries of presidential power and the independence of the central bank.</p>
<p>Trump cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements in applying for home mortgages. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term. All three former living Fed chairs—Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen—signed on to a legal brief arguing against Cook&#39;s removal, along with a group of former Treasury secretaries and chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>The Trump administration also hit the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on January 9, initiating a criminal investigation into Powell for his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June regarding cost overruns at Federal Reserve building renovations. Powell stated: &quot;This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of federal reserve buildings. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.&quot;</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Developments</h2>
<h3>Bitcoin Crashes Below $75,000 in Weekend Bloodbath, Marking Fourth Consecutive Monthly Decline - <em>Feb 2, 9:15 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since April 2025, wiping roughly $800 billion in market value since its October peak and knocking it out of the global top 10 assets as leveraged long positions were liquidated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin plunged below $75,000 on Sunday, February 2, extending a drawdown that has wiped more than 30% off the value of the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency since its October 2025 peak of approximately $126,000. The move marked Bitcoin&#39;s lowest level since April 2025, when markets were rattled by U.S. tariff announcements. The drop capped Bitcoin&#39;s fourth consecutive monthly decline and its longest losing streak in seven years.</p>
<p>A confluence of factors drove the crash: President Trump&#39;s nomination of Kevin Warsh—a known monetary hawk—to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair landed as a shock to markets, immediately resetting expectations for rate cuts. The U.S. dollar surged, rate-cut odds for the first half of 2026 collapsed, and risk assets were repriced lower. Disappointing earnings from Magnificent Seven tech companies cracked the AI narrative, while a violent precious metals unwind added to risk-off sentiment.</p>
<p>Data from Glassnode confirms that Bitcoin fell below its True Market Mean—currently at $80,500—for the first time in 30 months. Historically, a breach of this level marks a switch from a bullish cycle to a medium-term bearish trend. Compass Point analysts say the crypto bear market is in its &quot;final innings,&quot; with bitcoin likely to bottom between $60,000 and $68,000 absent a broader U.S. equity bear market. They warn that the $70,000 to $80,000 range is an &quot;air pocket&quot; with little structural support.</p>
<h3>January 2026 Bitcoin ETF Outflows Hit $1.6 Billion as Institutional Appetite Evaporates - <em>Jan 31, 4:30 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted their worst month since launch with $1.61 billion in net outflows, while BlackRock&#39;s IBIT alone shed over $500 million in a single day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>January 2026 proved to be a brutal reset month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posting -$1.61 billion in net outflows for the month. Total monthly traded value reached $86.99 billion, with $106.96 billion in total net assets at month end. The ETF bid that underpinned Bitcoin through much of 2025 has effectively evaporated.</p>
<p>U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs suffered heavy redemptions on January 29, with nearly $1 billion yanked in a single session. Investors withdrew $817.9 million from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs on January 29, the largest daily outflow since November 20. BlackRock&#39;s IBIT bore the brunt of redemptions, shedding $317.8 million, while Fidelity&#39;s FBTC lost $168 million and Grayscale&#39;s GBTC saw $119.4 million exit.</p>
<p>The 11 spot ETFs cumulatively registered a net outflow of $1.09 billion in December after a much steeper $3.48 billion in November. That amounts to a combined two-month redemption worth $4.57 billion—the largest since their debut in January 2024. On the Ethereum side, January 30 showed net ETF flow of -$252.87 million, with $1.80 billion traded value and $15.86 billion total net assets.</p>
<h3>$2.5 Billion Liquidation Cascade Amplifies Crypto Downturn - <em>Jan 31, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Forced deleveraging triggered over $2.5 billion in liquidations in a single 24-hour period, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion as overleveraged traders were forced to close positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of forced selling was staggering, with more than $2 billion of bitcoin long and short positions liquidated since Thursday, January 30. This wasn&#39;t a gradual correction—it was a violent deleveraging wave that forced prices down sharply. Market structure evidence supports a liquidity and positioning driven move into month end.</p>
<p>In a single 24-hour period, $2.53 billion in futures liquidations occurred, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion. Ethereum was the hardest hit, accounting for nearly half of the total carnage with $1.14 billion in liquidations. Forced deleveraging acted as a direct transmission mechanism, with estimated 24-hour liquidations exceeding $1.7 billion around January 30, followed by an estimated $2.5 billion on January 31.</p>
<p>Bitcoin fell about 12% in the last seven days, wiping off more than $200 billion in market value and triggering over $2 billion in forced liquidations, creating a cascading effect that amplified the downturn. According to analysts, the outflows coincided with a broader risk-off sentiment driven by hawkish Fed expectations and geopolitical tensions, with ETF flows reacting to price weakness rather than leading it.</p>
<h3>Senate Agriculture Committee Advances Landmark Crypto Regulation Bill - <em>Jan 29, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In a historic first, a crypto market structure bill advanced beyond a Senate committee as the Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act passed on a 12-11 party-line vote, establishing CFTC regulatory authority over digital commodities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines on January 29 to advance its version of a cryptocurrency market structure bill, marking the first time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act advanced on a 12-11 vote with all Republicans voting &quot;yes&quot; and all Democrats voting &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislation would establish a clear legal definition of digital commodities and create a spot market digital commodity intermediary regulatory regime with the CFTC. It would also create consumer protections, including conflict of interest safeguards and customer disclosure requirements. The proposed bill grants regulatory authority to both the CFTC and the SEC and clarifies the jurisdictional scope between the two agencies—the CFTC would be granted explicit authority over spot market digital asset commodities, while the SEC would maintain authority over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract.</p>
<p>The crypto industry now has two permanent, crypto-friendly chairmen at the SEC and CFTC, with no Democratic pushback. Paul Atkins leads the SEC, while Trump nominee Mike Selig won confirmation late last month and was sworn in as CFTC chairman on December 22. The Senate Banking Committee would also need to approve its version of a crypto market structure bill before the two measures could combine and advance to the full Senate.</p>
<h3>Geopolitical Tensions and Iran Explosion Rattle Crypto Markets - <em>Feb 1, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A sharp escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, including an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port, triggered a wave of selling across crypto, gold, silver, and U.S. stock futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto markets extended their decline as geopolitical tensions escalated, with the selloff gathering pace following reports of an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port—a critical shipping hub on the Strait of Hormuz that handles about a fifth of the world&#39;s seaborne oil. Bitcoin fell sharply, sliding below the $80,000 mark to levels last seen in April 2025, while Ethereum hovered near $2,200 as a wave of liquidations hit leveraged positions during low-liquidity weekend trading.</p>
<p>For the first time, the United States has sanctioned crypto exchanges linked to Iran. This decision, announced at the end of January 2026, targets two British platforms accused of facilitating transactions for Iranian entities under embargo—specifically Zedex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd. for their alleged role in financing Iranian entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>Iran&#39;s crypto ecosystem reached over $7.78 billion in 2025, having grown at a notably faster pace compared to the year prior. Iran&#39;s crypto activity shows significant spikes corresponding to major domestic and geopolitical events. During Iran&#39;s recent protests and internet blackout from December 28, 2025 to January 8, 2026, there were substantial increases in both daily dollar amounts transacted and withdrawals from Iranian exchanges to personal Bitcoin wallets—suggesting Iranians are taking possession of Bitcoin at a markedly higher rate as a rational response to the collapse of the Iranian rial.</p>
