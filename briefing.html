<h3>1. Portugal Elects Socialist António José Seguro as President in Landslide Victory Over Far-Right Rival</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Center-left Socialist candidate António José Seguro won Portugal&#39;s presidential runoff election with 66.7% of votes compared to 33.3% for hard-right populist André Ventura, marking only the second time in Portuguese history that a direct presidential election went to a second round.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 63-year-old Socialist candidate will succeed conservative Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as president after a commanding victory that saw him win 303 out of 308 municipalities and all 20 districts. The decisive margin represents a strong rejection of Ventura&#39;s far-right Chega party platform, which had gained momentum in recent years amid concerns about immigration and economic policy. Seguro&#39;s victory signals Portugal&#39;s continued commitment to moderate, center-left governance even as far-right movements have gained ground elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>In the first round held on January 18, Seguro secured 31% while Ventura came second with 23.5%, but neither candidate reached the required 50% threshold. The runoff saw Seguro consolidate support from across the political spectrum, including voters who supported other candidates in the first round. Despite losing the overseas vote to Ventura, Seguro&#39;s domestic support proved overwhelming, particularly in urban centers and traditional Socialist strongholds.</p>
<p>The election comes at a critical time for Portugal as it navigates economic challenges including inflation pressures and housing affordability crises. Seguro&#39;s campaign focused on defending democratic institutions, promoting social cohesion, and maintaining Portugal&#39;s commitment to European integration. His presidency will be largely ceremonial but carries significant symbolic weight in a Europe increasingly polarized between establishment and populist forces.</p>

<h3>2. US Proposes June Deadline to End Ukraine War as Peace Talks Continue Without Breakthrough</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed that the United States is proposing both Ukraine and Russia end the war by the beginning of summer 2026, following a second round of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi that concluded February 5 without a major breakthrough on territorial disputes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The June deadline represents the Trump administration&#39;s effort to accelerate diplomatic progress after two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi failed to bridge fundamental disagreements over territory. Russia continues to demand Ukraine withdraw from all of the Donbas region, including heavily fortified cities that represent some of Ukraine&#39;s strongest defenses. Kyiv categorically rejects any unilateral pullback and insists any ceasefire must freeze the conflict along current front lines, with neither side willing to concede on this core issue.</p>
<p>Zelensky stated that &quot;The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer,&quot; adding that if the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to reach an agreement. The talks concluded on February 5 with a prisoner exchange agreement for 314 POWs and a commitment to reestablish U.S.-Russia military-to-military dialogue, but the readout described discussions as &quot;constructive&quot; rather than yielding concrete progress on the underlying conflict.</p>
<p>The diplomatic push comes as the war approaches its fourth anniversary this month, with both sides entrenched in positions that appear mutually exclusive. The United States and Russia agreed to restore military communication channels, which observers view as a positive step toward preventing miscalculation, but European allies have expressed concern about being excluded from the trilateral format. France and the United Kingdom have pledged to deploy forces to Ukrainian territory if a ceasefire is reached, offering security guarantees that could form part of a final settlement.</p>

<h3>3. Israel Security Cabinet Approves Sweeping Measures to Deepen Control Over West Bank</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Israel&#39;s security cabinet on Sunday approved measures aimed at strengthening Israeli control over the occupied West Bank and weakening the Palestinian Authority, including repealing a Jordanian-era regulation that restricted the sale of West Bank land to private Jewish individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new rules will make it easier for Israeli settlers to purchase land in the occupied West Bank and give Israeli officials stronger powers to enforce laws on Palestinians in the area. Central to the decision is the repeal of a decades-old regulation from the Jordanian administration period that had limited land sales, a move Palestinian officials describe as facilitating de facto annexation. The measures also expand the authority of Israeli civil administration officials to implement regulations in Area C, which comprises approximately 60% of the West Bank and remains under full Israeli control under the Oslo Accords.</p>
<p>The Palestinian presidency immediately condemned the decision as &quot;dangerous&quot; and an &quot;open Israeli attempt to legalize settlement expansion&quot; and land confiscation. President Mahmoud Abbas&#39;s office called on the United States and the United Nations Security Council to intervene immediately, warning that the unilateral measures aim to eliminate any political prospects and obliterate the two-state solution. Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh characterized the steps as a violation of all signed and binding agreements, international law, and a serious escalation that drags the entire region into further tension and instability.</p>
<p>The timing of the announcement, coming on a Sunday when international attention is often reduced, follows a pattern of controversial policy announcements during weekend news cycles. The measures represent the most significant expansion of Israeli administrative control over the West Bank in years and are likely to draw condemnation from the international community, though previous such moves have rarely resulted in meaningful consequences. The decision further complicates any prospects for renewed peace negotiations and deepens the already profound mistrust between Israeli and Palestinian leadership.</p>

<h3>4. China and South Korea Resume Defense Talks to Restore Joint Maritime Search-and-Rescue Drills</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>China and South Korea held working-level defense talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss resuming joint maritime search-and-rescue drills that have been suspended for approximately 15 years, marking a significant step in bilateral military cooperation amid regional security tensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The talks were led by Lee Kwang-suk, director general of South Korea&#39;s Defense Ministry International Policy Bureau, and his Chinese counterpart, Guo Hongtao. The SAREX (Search and Rescue Exercise) drills were last conducted in 2011, with previous iterations held in 2005, 2007, and 2008. Officials agreed to restore defense cooperation, expand its scope, and revive dormant channels for strategic military communication through continued discussions, with the exercises set to take place in the Yellow Sea.</p>
<p>The drills are intended to promote humanitarian maritime cooperation, improve safety at sea, and expand military exchanges aimed at strengthening relations between the two countries. The resumption discussions come as both nations take steps to improve bilateral relations and address pending issues following summit talks between South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and Chinese President Xi Jinping in early January. The meeting represents a practical effort to rebuild trust and operational coordination after more than a decade of suspended joint military activities.</p>
<p>The timing is significant given ongoing tensions in Northeast Asia, including North Korea&#39;s continued weapons development, competing territorial claims in regional waters, and the broader U.S.-China strategic competition. While the humanitarian focus of search-and-rescue exercises is less politically sensitive than combat-oriented drills, the resumption still signals both countries&#39; desire to maintain functional military-to-military communication channels. The restoration of these exercises could serve as a foundation for expanded defense dialogue if bilateral relations continue to improve.</p>

<h3>5. European Union Proposes 20th Sanctions Package Targeting Russia&#39;s Shadow Oil Fleet and Energy Revenues</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Commission presented a draft of the EU&#39;s 20th sanctions package against Russia, focusing on energy, financial services, and trade, with the centerpiece being a full ban on maritime services for Russian crude oil aimed at crippling the Kremlin&#39;s shadow tanker fleet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proposed maritime services ban would prohibit EU companies from providing any type of service—including insurance, shipping, or port access—to vessels carrying Russian crude oil, regardless of whether they comply with the G7 price cap. This represents a significant escalation from current rules, which allow such services for tankers that respect the $60-per-barrel price ceiling imposed in December 2022. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the measure should be implemented &quot;in coordination with like-minded partners after a decision&quot; at the G7 level, though Finland and Sweden have been advocating for the blanket ban for months.</p>
<p>On energy, the package introduces sweeping bans on provision of maintenance and other services for LNG tankers and icebreakers to further dent Russia&#39;s gas export projects. The EU is listing 43 more vessels as part of the shadow fleet, bringing the total to 640 designated tankers. The Commission estimates the measure will slash Russia&#39;s energy revenues further and make it more difficult to find buyers for its oil. Additionally, the EU is making it harder for Russia to acquire replacement tankers through new restrictions on vessel sales and services.</p>
<p>Beyond energy, the package targets 20 more Russian regional banks and introduces new measures against cryptocurrencies, companies trading them, and platforms enabling crypto transactions to close avenues for sanctions circumvention. New import bans will include metals, chemicals, and critical minerals not yet under sanctions, worth over €570 million, while export restrictions will cover goods and services ranging from rubber to tractors and cybersecurity services, worth more than €360 million. The package must now be discussed and approved by the Council of the EU, requiring unanimous support from all 27 member states before taking effect.</p>

<h3>6. US Think Tank Urges Renegotiation of Japan Agreement to Maintain Marines on Okinawa Amid China Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Atlantic Council released a report recommending that Washington renegotiate a decades-old agreement with Japan to retain approximately 5,000 Marines on Okinawa rather than relocating them to Guam, citing the strategic necessity of maintaining forward-deployed forces in the First Island Chain to deter China and North Korea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recommendation directly contradicts current U.S.-Japan plans to shift 5,000 Marines and 1,300 dependents from Okinawa to Guam, along with additional forces to other Pacific locations, as part of a long-negotiated force realignment. The Atlantic Council&#39;s report also suggests retaining the Corps&#39; airfield in densely populated central Okinawa along with a replacement runway under construction farther north, arguing that the strategic environment has deteriorated significantly since the original agreements were negotiated. The proposed changes would maintain a Marine presence above 9,000 on Okinawa, reversing planned reductions of more than 50%.</p>
<p>The report&#39;s authors argue that Okinawa&#39;s geographic position within the First Island Chain makes it indispensable for rapid response to potential crises in the Taiwan Strait or Korean Peninsula. With China&#39;s military modernization accelerating and North Korea&#39;s nuclear and missile capabilities expanding, the think tank contends that reducing the Marine presence would create an operational gap at precisely the moment when forward-deployed forces are most needed. The recommendation comes as the U.S. conducts major exercises in the region, including Iron Fist 26, which will run from February 11-26 and February 27-March 9 with approximately 1,550 U.S. and Japanese troops.</p>
<p>The proposal faces significant political obstacles, as the current realignment plan was negotiated over many years to address Okinawan concerns about the heavy U.S. military footprint on the island. Okinawa Prefecture hosts 26,000 to 30,000 U.S. personnel, representing approximately half of all American forces in Japan despite comprising less than 1% of Japan&#39;s total land area. Local opposition to the U.S. presence has been persistent, with issues including noise pollution, crime, and environmental damage fueling calls for base reductions. Any attempt to reverse or modify the agreed realignment would require delicate diplomacy with both Tokyo and local Okinawan authorities.</p>

<h3>7. Measles Outbreak in Washington DC Expands with Multiple Cases Linked to March for Life Event</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>DC Health officials confirmed multiple cases of measles in the District and warned that attendees of the January March for Life rally may have been exposed, as infected individuals visited major transit hubs including Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Union Station, an Amtrak Northeast Regional train, and the Metro subway system while contagious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confirmed cases visited the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and Catholic University while infectious, prompting health officials to issue public exposure notices for anyone who visited these locations during specified time periods. Children&#39;s National Hospital also issued a notice concerning potential exposure in its Emergency Department, with a Virginia resident who was confirmed to have measles visiting the facility while contagious on February 2. Health officials are contacting individuals who may have been exposed and are advising anyone possibly exposed who is not fully vaccinated or has a compromised immune system to contact the health department or their healthcare provider immediately.</p>
<p>The outbreak in the nation&#39;s capital is part of a broader measles crisis sweeping the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting 733 confirmed measles cases in 20 states so far in 2026 as of last Thursday—representing the biggest measles outbreak the country has faced in decades. According to the CDC, 95% of the cases involved people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, underscoring the critical role of immunization in preventing disease spread.</p>
<p>The high-profile exposure locations raise particular concern given the volume of travelers passing through Union Station and Reagan National Airport, with the potential for the virus to spread to other cities via infected but asymptomatic travelers. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, with each infected person typically infecting 12 to 18 unprotected individuals. The virus can remain airborne and infectious for up to two hours after an infected person leaves a space, making exposure risk significant even for those who were not in direct contact with infected individuals. Public health officials are racing to identify and notify potentially exposed individuals before they unknowingly spread the disease further.</p>

<h3>8. Somalia Cancels Security Agreements with UAE Amid Federal-Regional Tensions and Al-Shabab Threat</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somalia&#39;s Federal Government announced in January 2026 the cancellation of all bilateral security and defense agreements with the United Arab Emirates, citing national sovereignty concerns, as political fragmentation between Mogadishu and federal member states undermines the fight against al-Shabab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision to sever security ties with the UAE comes amid deepening mistrust between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and federal member states, particularly Puntland and Jubaland, over President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud&#39;s efforts to amend the country&#39;s provisional constitution and centralize executive power. Critics view these moves as a unilateral push to extend Mohamud&#39;s time in office beyond his May 2026 mandate while redrawing the federal map to consolidate presidential authority. The UAE had maintained security and counterterrorism cooperation with various Somali regions, making the cancellation significant for operational coordination.</p>
<p>The political infighting has created opportunities for al-Shabab, the proscribed terrorist group and Al-Qaeda affiliate that continues to carry out attacks and control rural areas throughout Somalia. Jihadi group al-Shabab has capitalized on political fragmentation by intensifying attacks, including an assault on a high-security prison in Mogadishu in October. Large portions of the country remain either under the operational control of al-Shabab or dependent on fragile local administrations backed by international peacekeepers from the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM).</p>
<p>Somalia is expected to hold elections in 2026, though disputes over changing its indirect electoral system have threatened to delay the vote and risk a legitimacy crisis. The security environment remains precarious, with Ethiopia agreeing to deploy 2,500 troops to AUSSOM in early 2025 after diplomatic relations with Somalia were restored. However, concerns persist that Ethiopia may attempt to establish a port in Somaliland or seize Assab in Eritrea, ratcheting up regional tensions. The combination of internal political discord, persistent terrorist threats, and complex regional dynamics leaves Somalia at a critical juncture as it approaches both elections and the expiration of Mohamud&#39;s presidential mandate.</p>

<h3>9. Latin America Economic Growth Projected to Slow to 2.2% in 2026 Amid Regional Elections and Trade Tensions</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic growth across Latin America and the Caribbean is projected to decelerate to 2.2% in 2026, down from an expected 2.4% expansion in 2025, as the region faces headwinds from U.S. trade policy uncertainty, commodity price volatility, and a challenging electoral calendar featuring presidential votes in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Costa Rica.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The region&#39;s top seven economies—Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador—are projected to record GDP growth of just 1.9% in 2026, down from an estimated 2.1% the previous year. Mexico and Brazil, the region&#39;s two largest economies, are expected to grow at 1.3% and 1.7% respectively, with Mexico accelerating from 2025&#39;s near-zero growth while Brazil consolidates below-trend growth due to a consumption slowdown. Argentina, after a strong GDP rebound expected in 2025 under President Javier Milei&#39;s reforms, is forecasted to decelerate toward 3.1% growth in 2026. Peru is forecasted to be the fastest-growing major economy as commodities such as gold and copper hit record highs.</p>
<p>The political calendar adds uncertainty to the economic outlook, with elections testing the rightward political shift seen across much of the Americas in 2025. Peru will hold elections in April and May, Colombian voters go to the polls for the first time at the end of June, and Brazil votes at the beginning of October. Argentina handed President Milei a legislative boost in midterm elections, potentially enabling further economic reforms. The electoral uncertainty complicates investment decisions and policy planning across the region.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s approach to the region presents additional challenges, with tariff threats, harsh immigration restrictions, and potential modifications to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) creating volatility for trade-dependent economies. This summer, the three countries face a deadline for whether to scrap, keep, or tweak the USMCA trade deal that took effect in 2020. Mexico&#39;s accelerating growth from 2025&#39;s near-stagnation depends significantly on maintaining stable trade relations with the United States, while the 2026 FIFA World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada could provide economic benefits if immigration and border issues don&#39;t create complications.</p>

<h3>10. Ethiopia and Somalia Regional Tensions Rise Amid June Elections and Ongoing Insecurity</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethiopia is set to hold a general election in June 2026, the first since 2021 when conflict and insecurity prevented voting in many areas, as Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed&#39;s Prosperity Party is expected to win comfortably amid opposition boycotts and a worsening security crisis in Tigray, Amhara, and Oromia regions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The elections are set to consolidate one-party rule under the Prosperity Party despite the 2022 Pretoria Agreement that ended the Tigray conflict. Key opposition groups are expected to boycott the polls, and voting is unlikely to take place in many contested areas including Tigray, where insecurity persists alongside ongoing tensions with Eritrea over maritime access and sovereignty concerns. The security environment has deteriorated across multiple regions, with ethnic violence and insurgent activity complicating the government&#39;s ability to conduct credible elections across the country&#39;s diverse regions.</p>
<p>Regional tensions with Somalia have intensified over Ethiopian maritime ambitions, with concerns that Ethiopia may establish a port in Berbera, Somaliland, or attempt to seize Assab in Eritrea. These fears have ratcheted up anxiety in the Horn of Africa, where competing territorial claims and resource access drive interstate tensions. Ethiopia and Somalia restored diplomatic relations and greater cooperation on security in recent months, including Ethiopia&#39;s agreement to deploy 2,500 troops to the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) in early 2025, but underlying tensions over sovereignty and maritime access remain unresolved.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch documented that Kenya&#39;s security forces brutally repressed protests using lethal force and committed other serious abuses against protesters, while Ethiopia&#39;s security situation in the Horn of Africa continues to be characterized by war crimes and election repression. The June elections in Ethiopia will serve as a critical test of the country&#39;s democratic trajectory and regional stability, with implications for neighboring countries including Somalia, Kenya, Eritrea, and Sudan that are grappling with their own security and governance challenges.</p>

<h3>1. S&amp;P 500 Rebounds $1 Trillion in Week&#39;s Strongest Rally Since May Despite Lingering Tech Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 posted its best single-day gain since May on Friday, erasing most of the previous week&#39;s AI-driven selloff and recouping approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization, but stock strategists signaled limited conviction in the market&#39;s ability to build sustainably on the recovery amid murky economic outlook and AI spending concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friday&#39;s sharp recovery saw the S&amp;P 500 surge 1.97% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the historic 50,000 milestone for the first time, jumping 2.47%. The rally was broad-based, with chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom gaining 7.8% and 7.2% respectively as investors reconsidered the severity of the prior week&#39;s rout that was triggered by concerns about massive AI capital expenditure plans and uncertain returns. An ETF tracking software firms added 3.5%, and a gauge of chipmakers soared 5.7% as momentum buyers returned to beaten-down technology names.</p>
<p>However, the relief rally has done little to resolve the fundamental questions plaguing investors about the sustainability of AI infrastructure spending and its eventual return on investment. Investors remain wrestling with persistent concerns about how artificial intelligence will reshape various industries, particularly the software sector that was at the center of the week&#39;s turmoil. The S&amp;P 500&#39;s futures were indicating a cautiously optimistic start to the new week, advancing approximately 0.1% to 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2% to 0.6% higher.</p>
<p>Despite Friday&#39;s surge, market internals revealed continued stress beneath the surface, with the rotation from growth into value stocks accelerating and the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; mega-cap technology stocks diverging sharply in performance. The rebound occurred without clear catalysts beyond short-covering and bargain hunting, leaving analysts questioning whether the bounce represents a durable turning point or merely a pause in a broader de-risking process. With key economic data including the delayed January jobs report scheduled for February 11 and Fed speakers lined up throughout the week, investors face significant uncertainty about the economy&#39;s true trajectory.</p>

<h3>2. Apollo Global Management Reports Record Q4 Earnings with $300 Billion in Originations and $225 Billion in Inflows</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apollo Global Management released fourth-quarter 2025 earnings before Monday&#39;s market open, reporting record origination activity exceeding $300 billion and inflows of more than $225 billion for the full year, driving record fee and spread-related earnings as CEO Marc Rowan called the results exceptional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The alternative asset manager&#39;s fourth quarter capped what Rowan characterized as &quot;a year of exceptional execution,&quot; with the company&#39;s origination machine operating at unprecedented scale. Apollo reported earnings per share that met or beat analyst estimates of $1.99, driven by strong performance across its credit, private equity, and real assets platforms. The record origination activity of $300 billion represents the deployment of capital into loans, credit instruments, and equity investments across Apollo&#39;s various strategies, while the $225 billion in inflows demonstrates continued strong demand from institutional and retail investors for alternative asset exposure.</p>
<p>Fee and spread-related earnings reached record levels as Apollo&#39;s asset base expanded and the firm captured higher margins on both management fees and the spread between borrowing costs and returns on deployed capital. The company&#39;s insurance platforms, including Athene, contributed significantly to earnings as rising assets under management generated growing fee streams. Apollo has positioned itself at the intersection of insurance capital and alternative asset management, using permanent capital from insurance subsidiaries to fund long-duration private credit and infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>The earnings report came as investors paid close attention to speeches from Federal Reserve officials, with Fed Governor Christopher Waller scheduled to speak at 1:30 PM ET and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 3:15 PM ET on Monday. The strong results from Apollo underscore the continued institutional appetite for alternative investments despite market volatility, though the firm&#39;s rich valuation leaves little room for disappointment. With assets under management continuing to grow and origination pipelines robust, Apollo is positioning itself for another strong year in 2026, though rising competition in private credit and potential economic headwinds pose risks to sustained growth.</p>

<h3>3. Reddit Shares Surge 13% After Q4 Earnings Beat and $1 Billion Share Buyback Announcement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reddit reported fourth-quarter revenue of $726 million versus expectations of $665 million and earnings per share of $1.24 versus 94 cents expected, sending shares up 13% after the social media company announced a $1 billion share repurchase program and issued strong first-quarter guidance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company&#39;s fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% year-over-year, while net income reached $252 million, up nearly 255% from the same period last year. Reddit&#39;s advertising business showed particular strength as the platform&#39;s user engagement metrics continued to improve and advertisers increasingly recognized Reddit&#39;s value for reaching high-intent audiences. The earnings beat marked another quarter of the company exceeding Wall Street&#39;s expectations since its March 2024 initial public offering, demonstrating the sustainability of its advertising-driven business model.</p>
<p>Management provided upbeat guidance for the first quarter of 2026, projecting sales in the range of $595 million to $605 million—significantly higher than Wall Street&#39;s expectations of $577 million. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter are projected between $210 million and $220 million, ahead of consensus estimates of $203 million. CFO Drew Vollero stated that Reddit can now afford to invest in growth, pursue acquisitions, and buy back shares while keeping over $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, underscoring the company&#39;s strengthened financial position.</p>
<p>The $1 billion share buyback authorization signals management&#39;s confidence in Reddit&#39;s long-term prospects and provides support for the stock price. The announcement comes as Reddit continues to enhance its platform with AI-powered features for content discovery and moderation, expand its advertising offerings, and explore new revenue streams beyond traditional display advertising. However, concerns remain about the company&#39;s dependence on AI data licensing revenue and potential regulatory scrutiny of how social media platforms use user-generated content for training large language models. The strong results and guidance have validated the company&#39;s strategy, though sustaining 70% year-over-year growth will become increasingly challenging as the revenue base expands.</p>

<h3>4. Federal Reserve Officials Waller and Bostic to Speak Monday with Divergent Views on Rate Policy</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are scheduled to speak Monday in what analysts expect will provide insights into the central bank&#39;s monetary policy thinking, with the two officials having expressed notably different views on the appropriate pace of rate adjustments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governor Waller is scheduled to speak at 1:30 PM ET, with his comments expected to offer insights into the Fed&#39;s current monetary policy stance and economic assessment. Waller has recently advocated for rate cuts, having dissented at the most recent FOMC meeting in January after concluding that cutting the policy rate by 25 basis points was appropriate. In his view, monetary policy remains restrictive and is continuing to constrain economic activity, suggesting the Fed has room to ease without reigniting inflation pressures.</p>
<p>In contrast, Atlanta Fed President Bostic is scheduled to speak at 3:15 PM ET and has favored a more restrictive approach. Bostic supported the FOMC&#39;s January decision to hold rates steady at the 3.50%-3.75% range, arguing that the central bank needs to maintain a somewhat restrictive stance because inflation remains too high relative to the Fed&#39;s 2% target. Bostic&#39;s recent public remarks have emphasized the need for patience in assessing whether inflation is sustainably returning to target before cutting rates further.</p>
<p>The divergence between Waller&#39;s dovish stance and Bostic&#39;s hawkish positioning reflects broader divisions within the Federal Reserve about the appropriate path for monetary policy. Markets currently price in roughly two quarter-point cuts later in 2026, with the first expected in June and a potential second in September. However, Chairman Jerome Powell has reiterated that each decision will depend on incoming data, particularly inflation readings and labor market indicators. The delayed January jobs report, scheduled for release on February 11, will be closely scrutinized for signs of labor market weakening that could justify earlier rate cuts or continued strength that would support Bostic&#39;s more cautious approach.</p>

<h3>5. Palantir Projects 61% Revenue Growth for 2026 Far Above Forecasts as AI Demand Accelerates</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Technologies reported fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share of 25 cents versus 23 cents expected and revenue of $1.41 billion versus $1.33 billion expected, sending shares higher as management guided fiscal 2026 revenue to $7.18-$7.20 billion—implying 61% growth that far exceeded Wall Street&#39;s $6.27 billion estimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company&#39;s revenue grew 70% from $827.5 million in the year-ago period, with particularly strong performance in commercial markets where U.S. commercial revenue surged 137% to $507 million. Government revenue grew 66% year-over-year, driven by new contracts including a $448 million U.S. Navy deal to launch ShipOS for AI-powered shipbuilding modernization. Total contract value reached $4.26 billion, up 138% from the prior year, demonstrating unprecedented demand for Palantir&#39;s AI platforms across both government and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>The 2026 revenue forecast represents the 10th straight quarter of accelerating total revenue growth for Palantir, driven by upside in both commercial and government segments. CEO Alex Karp called the results &quot;the best results that I&#39;m aware of in tech in the last decade,&quot; highlighting how the company&#39;s positioning at the intersection of artificial intelligence and national security has created a unique growth trajectory. The Pentagon&#39;s 2026 budget request included a record $13.4 billion dedicated line item for AI—the first such allocation in DoD history—positioning Palantir as a primary beneficiary of the government AI spending wave.</p>
<p>However, the stock&#39;s valuation remains hotly debated, with Palantir trading at approximately 174 times forward earnings and a forward price-to-sales ratio of 67.5. Multiple analysts raised price targets following the earnings beat and guidance raise, with William Blair upgrading shares to Buy with a $200 price target. Bulls argue that Palantir&#39;s unique capabilities in handling sensitive government data and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) for commercial enterprises justify premium multiples, while bears contend that even the exceptional growth trajectory is already priced into shares, leaving little margin for error. The guidance for 61% revenue growth in 2026 would make Palantir the fastest company in software history to approach $10 billion in annual revenue at its current margins.</p>

<h3>6. Advanced Micro Devices Reports Strong Q4 Earnings But Stock Slides on Nvidia Comparison</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.53 per share on revenue of $10.27 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.32 per share and $9.67 billion in revenue, but shares declined as investors compared AMD&#39;s data center growth to Nvidia&#39;s dominant AI accelerator performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD&#39;s revenue beat was driven by strength across multiple segments, with data center revenue showing solid growth as the company&#39;s MI300 series AI accelerators gained traction with cloud service providers and enterprise customers. The Instinct MI300X GPU has emerged as the primary alternative to Nvidia&#39;s dominant H100 and H200 chips, with AMD capturing market share among customers seeking to diversify their AI hardware suppliers. However, AMD&#39;s data center growth of 34% year-over-year failed to match Nvidia&#39;s trajectory, disappointing investors who had hoped AMD would close the gap more rapidly.</p>
<p>The stock&#39;s 17% decline in early February reflected the market&#39;s harsh assessment that AMD remains a distant second in the AI accelerator market despite improving product competitiveness. While the MI300 series has won significant design wins at Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, and Meta&#39;s infrastructure, Nvidia&#39;s CUDA software ecosystem and first-mover advantage in AI training have proven difficult to overcome. AMD&#39;s CPU business also faced headwinds from Intel&#39;s improving competitive position in certain server segments, though AMD maintained overall market share leadership in data center processors.</p>
<p>Despite the stock&#39;s pullback, AMD&#39;s fundamental business remains healthy with strong execution across its product portfolio. The company&#39;s acquisition of ZT Systems for $4.9 billion closed in early 2026, providing AMD with enhanced systems design capabilities that should help it compete more effectively for large-scale AI infrastructure deployments. Management reiterated confidence in capturing a &quot;mid-teens&quot; percentage of the AI accelerator market by the end of 2026, which would represent tens of billions in annual revenue. However, investors are increasingly skeptical that AMD can achieve meaningful share gains against Nvidia&#39;s entrenched position, leaving the stock vulnerable to continued underperformance despite solid operational execution.</p>

<h3>7. Treasury Yields Fall to Three-Week Lows as Soft Labor Data Supports Rate Cut Expectations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell below the 4.2% mark to the lowest level in three weeks as soft labor market data supported the outlook for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026, with job openings falling to a five-year low in December and January job cuts reaching the highest total for the month since 2009.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield traded at approximately 4.22%, down from recent highs above 4.40% as investors reassessed the trajectory of monetary policy. The 30-year Treasury yield rose modestly to 4.87%, briefly touching 4.88% earlier—the highest level since September—before retreating. The curve steepening reflects expectations that the Fed will cut short-term rates while long-term yields remain elevated due to persistent fiscal deficits and inflation concerns that continue to exceed the Fed&#39;s 2% target.</p>
<p>Labor market weakness has emerged as a key factor shifting Fed expectations, with JOLTS data showing job openings plummeting and layoff announcements surging. January layoffs totaled 108,435—the highest January figure since the depths of the 2009 financial crisis—driven by large-scale reductions at UPS, Amazon, healthcare companies, and technology firms. The softening labor market has increased market pricing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, with investors now expecting two quarter-point reductions in 2026, likely beginning in June.</p>
<p>However, the Fed remains cautious about declaring victory over inflation, with recent data showing consumer prices expanding at the fastest pace in two years. At its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee kept the federal funds target rate at 3.50%-3.75%, with Chairman Jerome Powell emphasizing that policy decisions will remain data-dependent. The delayed January jobs report, rescheduled from February 7 to February 11 due to the government shutdown, will provide critical information about labor market momentum. If the report shows significant weakening, it could accelerate the timeline for Fed rate cuts, though officials have signaled they prefer to wait for clear evidence that inflation is sustainably returning to target before easing policy further.</p>

<h3>8. Oil Prices Hold Near $63 as Iran Tensions Create Risk Premium Amid Fundamental Oversupply</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crude oil prices stabilized near $63 per barrel on Monday as geopolitical risk premium from U.S.-Iran tensions offset concerns about fundamental oversupply, with analysts warning that prices could fall to EIA&#39;s forecast of $56 per barrel if diplomatic progress continues to drain war premium from markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oil experienced extreme volatility in the preceding week, with Brent crude breaching $72 per barrel on fears of U.S. military action against Iran before plunging back toward $60 after diplomatic talks in Oman produced what Tehran called &quot;a good start.&quot; The dramatic reversal illustrated how geopolitical speculation has become the dominant short-term driver of energy markets, overwhelming fundamental factors pointing to oversupply. The current price incorporates an estimated $3-$5 per barrel risk premium related to potential supply disruptions in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>OPEC+ maintained voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through the first quarter, with eight key producers agreeing on February 1 to pause planned output increases. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman cited seasonal factors and geopolitical uncertainty for the decision to keep barrels off the market. The group&#39;s next meeting is scheduled for March, when members will reassess market conditions including the trajectory of U.S.-Iran tensions, Chinese demand recovery, and the impact of potential tariff escalation on global economic growth.</p>
<p>Despite OPEC+ restraint, fundamental supply-demand dynamics point to growing oversupply in 2026. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts West Texas Intermediate crude will average $52 per barrel in 2026, down from $65 in 2025, with Brent expected to average $55 per barrel in the first quarter absent major supply disruptions. Several oil companies have completed or are about to complete major expansion projects, U.S. Permian Basin producers continue increasing output, and OPEC is positioned to gradually increase supplies—putting the world on pace for a supply glut. The challenge for oil markets is reconciling geopolitical risk that could send prices sharply higher with fundamental oversupply that should push prices significantly lower.</p>

<h3>9. Housing Market Forecast: Mortgage Rates Expected to Remain Above 6% Through 2026 as Home Price Growth Slows</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% throughout 2026 as persistently higher-than-desired inflation continues to offset a slowly weakening labor market, with the current average 30-year fixed rate at approximately 6.2% and forecasters projecting rates will hover near 6.3% for the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Major forecasters have aligned on a narrow range for 2026 mortgage rate expectations, with Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale and Redfin both projecting 30-year fixed rates will average 6.3%, while Fannie Mae predicts rates will average 6.2% in the first quarter before potentially declining modestly later in the year. The stubborn elevation of mortgage rates despite Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 reflects persistent inflation concerns and investors&#39; demands for higher risk premiums on long-term fixed-rate debt. J.P. Morgan expects rates to remain elevated at 6+% throughout the year.</p>
<p>Home price growth is projected to slow significantly in 2026 after years of rapid appreciation, with multiple forecasters expecting near-zero or minimal gains. J.P. Morgan projects U.S. home prices will &quot;stall at 0% nationally in 2026,&quot; meaning prices flatten on average rather than fall outright, though regional variation remains significant. Redfin expects the median U.S. home-sale price to rise just 1% year-over-year, while Zillow forecasts home values to grow 1.2% in 2026 after national values were roughly flat in 2025. The price deceleration reflects improving inventory levels as pandemic-era migration slows and affordability constraints limit buyer demand.</p>
<p>Construction activity is showing mixed signals, with the National Association of Home Builders projecting 1.05 million new homes built in 2026, up 4% from 2025. However, 2026 is shaping up to be the slowest year for single-family home construction starts since 2019 following a notably weak 2025. Home prices are rising faster in the Northeast and Midwest where there&#39;s less newly built housing, while in the South and West they&#39;re softening as insurance costs climb and supply increases. The housing market appears to be entering what analysts call &quot;The Great Housing Reset&quot;—a rebalancing after years of pandemic-driven distortions, with growing supply potentially pushing prices down in some markets while affordability remains challenged by elevated mortgage rates.</p>

<h3>10. Pharmaceutical Industry Sees Major GLP-1 Weight Loss Drug Price Cuts Through TrumpRx Platform</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk struck deals with the Trump administration to dramatically reduce prices of weight loss drugs through a new government platform called TrumpRx, with monthly costs dropping from over $1,000 to as low as $245 for Medicare patients and $350 for general purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the agreements announced in early 2026, Novo Nordisk&#39;s semaglutide agents Ozempic and Wegovy will see monthly prices reduced from approximately $1,000 and $1,350 respectively to $350 when purchased through TrumpRx. Medicare and state Medicaid programs will pay just $245 per month for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Eli Lilly&#39;s Zepbound and Mounjaro (tirzepatide for diabetes and obesity). Critically, Medicare will cover obesity treatments for the first time, representing a major expansion of access to weight loss medications for millions of seniors.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies also committed to making oral GLP-1 pills available at significantly reduced prices, with Novo Nordisk&#39;s oral semaglutide pill priced at $150 monthly for lower doses and up to $300 for higher doses, while Eli Lilly&#39;s oral weight loss pill—expected to gain FDA approval later in 2026—will cost $400 monthly. These prices apply when patients purchase without using health insurance, providing an affordable option for individuals whose plans don&#39;t cover weight loss drugs. The oral formulations represent a significant advancement over current injectable medications, potentially improving adherence and expanding the addressable patient population.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly reported strong fourth-quarter 2025 results and forecast 2026 profit above Wall Street estimates, betting on surging demand for obesity drugs as the company prepares to launch its oral weight-loss pill later this year. However, Lilly management warned that pricing will be a drag on growth in the low- to mid-teens in 2026, as the company expects to deliver industry-leading volume growth partially offset by lower realized prices from the TrumpRx agreements and increasing competitive pressure. The deals represent a landmark moment for pharmaceutical pricing policy, demonstrating the Trump administration&#39;s ability to negotiate significant price reductions while maintaining pharmaceutical company profitability through expanded volume access.</p>

<h3>1. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Assassinated in Libya, Thousands Mourn at Funeral</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3-6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, was assassinated on February 3 by four masked gunmen at his home in Zintan, Libya, triggering the largest funeral in Libyan history as thousands gathered in Bani Walid to mourn the controversial political figure who remained wanted by the International Criminal Court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four masked gunmen raided Gaddafi&#39;s residence in Zintan after disabling security cameras in a predawn assault. The 53-year-old politician, who had been his father&#39;s de facto number two from 2000 until the 2011 Libyan civil war, was killed in what his political team described as a &quot;cowardly and treacherous assassination.&quot; The assailants shut down the property&#39;s security cameras before storming the house, executing Gaddafi in an operation that bore the hallmarks of a planned hit rather than a spontaneous attack.</p>
<p>Libya&#39;s Public Prosecution Office in Tripoli announced an official investigation into the assassination, though early reports from the region suggested conflicting accounts about who was responsible. Some sources indicated potential involvement by France and the United Kingdom, though these claims remained unverified. Gaddafi had been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2011 on two counts of crimes against humanity for &quot;murder and persecution&quot; related to his role in suppressing opposition protests during the Libyan uprising that toppled his father&#39;s regime.</p>
<p>On February 6, thousands of Libyans attended Gaddafi&#39;s funeral in Bani Walid, marking what observers described as the biggest funeral in Libya&#39;s history. The massive turnout reflected both lingering support for the Gaddafi family among certain tribal groups and broader disillusionment with Libya&#39;s fragmented post-2011 political landscape. The assassination eliminates one of the few remaining figures with potential claim to national leadership based on the pre-revolution order, further complicating efforts to achieve political reconciliation in a country divided among rival governments, militias, and foreign-backed factions.</p>
<h3>2. Nigeria Gunmen Kill Nearly 200 in Deadliest Violence Since 2023 Across Kwara and Katsina States</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4-5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly 200 people were killed in coordinated attacks by suspected jihadist gunmen across Nigeria&#39;s Kwara and Katsina states on February 4, marking the deadliest outbreak of violence in the region in months as militants demanded residents abandon allegiance to the Nigerian government in favor of Sharia law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gunmen stormed the community of Woro in Kwara State on Tuesday evening, killing at least 170 people in the deadliest assault recorded this year in the district bordering Niger state. Residents told Reuters the gunmen, thought to be jihadists who often preached in the village, rounded up locals, bound their hands behind their backs, and executed them after demanding they switch allegiance from the Nigerian state to Sharia Islamic law. When villagers resisted these demands, the militants opened fire indiscriminately, targeting men, women, and children in a massacre that left entire families decimated.</p>
<p>A separate attack in Katsina State in northern Nigeria killed an additional 21 people, with gunmen moving from house to house murdering residents in a systematic pattern of violence. The coordinated nature of the attacks across two states suggested a level of planning and organization that alarmed Nigerian security officials. The violence represents an escalation in tactics by insurgent groups operating in Nigeria&#39;s northwest and north-central regions, where criminal gangs and jihadist militants have intensified operations amid weakened government control.</p>
<p>President Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced the deployment of an army battalion to Kwara State, with the military command spearheading an effort codenamed Operation Savannah Shield &quot;to checkmate the barbaric terrorists and protect defenceless communities.&quot; The military response reflects growing pressure on the Nigerian government to address deteriorating security conditions in rural areas where state presence has eroded. The attacks have displaced thousands of residents who fled to neighboring communities and urban centers, adding to Nigeria&#39;s already severe humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>
<h3>3. Japan&#39;s LDP Wins Historic Supermajority in Snap Election Under PM Sanae Takaichi</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japan&#39;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party secured 316 seats in the February 8 House of Representatives election, giving Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi&#39;s party the highest proportion of Lower House seats of any party in postwar Japanese history, just four months into her tenure following the party&#39;s coalition with the Japan Innovation Party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LDP&#39;s landslide victory represents a dramatic political comeback, with the party winning 316 seats compared to its pre-election total of 198 seats. Together with its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party (JIP), the bloc won 352 seats out of 465 total, significantly expanding its majority beyond the 233 required for control. The results give Takaichi, who became Prime Minister on October 21, 2025 after winning the LDP presidential election, an unprecedented mandate to pursue her policy agenda.</p>
<p>Takaichi had called the snap election in hopes of attracting sufficient votes to put her party back in the majority following a period of political uncertainty. The gamble paid off spectacularly, with the LDP achieving its strongest electoral performance in decades. The victory consolidates Takaichi&#39;s position as Japan&#39;s first long-term female Prime Minister and provides her government with the political capital to advance controversial policies including constitutional revision, increased defense spending, and economic stimulus measures.</p>
<p>The opposition Central Reform Alliance, composed of the former Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito (the LDP&#39;s former coalition partner), secured between 37 and 91 seats according to final tallies, a crushing defeat that leaves opposition parties fragmented and demoralized. The election results signal voter acceptance of Takaichi&#39;s nationalist conservative agenda and her administration&#39;s approach to managing Japan&#39;s economic challenges, demographic decline, and regional security concerns amid rising tensions with China and North Korea. International observers noted the election could embolden Japan to take a more assertive role in Indo-Pacific security architecture.</p>
<h3>4. Iran Sentences Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi to Seven Additional Years in Prison</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iranian authorities sentenced 2023 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to seven additional years and six months in prison on Saturday, along with two years of internal exile and a travel ban, as the imprisoned human rights activist remains in deteriorating health following a hunger strike protesting her detention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Revolutionary Court in Mashhad handed down the sentence on Saturday, which includes six years imprisonment for assembly and collusion against national security and 1.5 years for propaganda against the government. The court also punished Mohammadi with two years of internal exile in the remote city of Khusf and a two-year travel ban, penalties that will run concurrently with her existing 13 years and nine months sentence on previous charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran&#39;s government.</p>
<p>Mohammadi had been arrested in December at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate based in Mashhad. Supporters said Mohammadi began a hunger strike on February 2 to protest her detention and the broader crackdown on dissent in Iran, though she ended the nearly week-long hunger strike over the weekend amid concerns about her deteriorating health. The Nobel laureate won the 2023 Peace Prize while imprisoned for her campaign to advance women&#39;s rights and abolish the death penalty in Iran.</p>
<p>The additional sentence comes amid Iran&#39;s brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that began in late 2025, with human rights groups documenting thousands of deaths and arrests. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) documented a total of 18,571 cases as of February 5, 2026, including 6,941 confirmed deaths—at least 6,495 of them protesters—with 11,630 additional cases under review. Estimates of the total number of protesters killed range from 2,000 to 20,000, making it one of the deadliest government crackdowns in modern Iranian history.</p>
<h3>5. UK Prime Minister&#39;s Chief of Staff Resigns Over Mandelson Ambassador Appointment Amid Epstein Scandal</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#39;s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney resigned on Sunday, taking full responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as U.K. ambassador to the United States despite Mandelson&#39;s documented links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, triggering the gravest crisis of Starmer&#39;s 18-month premiership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McSweeney&#39;s resignation followed the January 30 release of court files in the United States that revealed the depth of Labour veteran Peter Mandelson&#39;s relationship with Epstein. The files sparked a police investigation for misconduct in office over indications that Mandelson leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he served as a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010. The scandal has put Starmer&#39;s judgment and vetting processes under intense scrutiny less than two years after Labour won one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern British history.</p>
<p>In a statement, McSweeney said: &quot;The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself. When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.&quot; The resignation represents a significant political blow to Starmer, as McSweeney was instrumental in the Labour leader&#39;s rise to power and served as his principal strategist throughout the successful 2024 general election campaign.</p>
<p>The controversy has triggered widespread criticism from across the political spectrum, with opposition parties demanding Starmer withdraw Mandelson&#39;s appointment and explain how such serious allegations were not identified during the vetting process. Political analysts described the scandal as Starmer&#39;s most perilous moment yet, potentially undermining his carefully cultivated image as a leader committed to integrity and accountability. The loss of McSweeney leaves Starmer without his most trusted advisor at a critical juncture when the government faces economic headwinds, public sector strikes, and increasingly fractious relations with the Trump administration.</p>
<h3>6. Canada and France Open Greenland Consulates in Show of Support Against U.S. Annexation Threats</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canada and France inaugurated diplomatic consulates in Nuuk, Greenland&#39;s capital, on Friday in a strong demonstration of support for NATO ally Denmark following President Donald Trump&#39;s repeated insistence on securing control of the Arctic island, with France becoming the first European Union country to establish a consulate general in Greenland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand traveled to Nuuk to open Canada&#39;s consulate, accompanied by Indigenous Governor General Mary Simon, with officials stating the mission could enhance cooperation on climate change and Inuit rights. France&#39;s Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs announced that Jean-Noel Poirier would take up duties as consul general, marking a significant diplomatic development as the first EU member state to establish such a presence in the semi-autonomous Danish territory.</p>
<p>The consulate openings come as President Trump has backed off recent threats to seize Greenland militarily, following what he described as a &quot;framework&quot; deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater U.S. influence in the strategically vital Arctic region. A U.S.-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington&#39;s security concerns, though details have not been made public. Trump has cited security concerns and Arctic sovereignty as justifications for seeking control of Greenland, which hosts important U.S. military installations including Thule Air Base.</p>
<p>The Franco-Canadian diplomatic moves signal European determination to reinforce Danish sovereignty over Greenland and resist unilateral U.S. actions that could destabilize the Arctic security framework. Greenland, which has significant autonomy within the Danish realm but relies on Copenhagen for defense and foreign affairs, sits at the center of intensifying great power competition as climate change opens new shipping routes and resource extraction opportunities in the Arctic. The consulate openings represent a carefully calibrated response that affirms allied support for Denmark while avoiding direct confrontation with the Trump administration.</p>
<h3>7. Pentagon Cuts Academic Ties with Harvard Over &quot;Woke&quot; Ideology Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6-7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on February 6 that the Pentagon will end all professional military education, fellowships, and certificate programs with Harvard University starting in the 2026-27 school year, declaring the institution &quot;no longer meets the needs of the War Department&quot; and criticizing the Ivy League school for promoting &quot;globalist and radical ideologies.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hegseth stated that &quot;For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks.&quot; The announcement affects military education programs across multiple services, though personnel currently attending classes at Harvard will be permitted to finish their courses.</p>
<p>The decision marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration&#39;s prolonged confrontation with Harvard over demands for institutional reforms. The standoff has included threats to revoke federal research funding, investigations into alleged discrimination in admissions practices, and public criticism of the university&#39;s handling of campus protests related to Middle East policy. The Pentagon&#39;s move represents the most concrete action taken against the institution to date.</p>
<p>Harvard has not yet issued a detailed public response to the Pentagon&#39;s decision, though university officials privately expressed concern that the move politicizes military education and could harm national security by limiting the intellectual development of future military leaders. Critics of Hegseth&#39;s decision, including some retired senior military officers, argued that exposure to diverse academic perspectives strengthens rather than weakens military leadership, and that the decision reflects ideological litmus testing inappropriate for educational policy.</p>
<h3>8. Federal Court Rules Trump Administration&#39;s Secret Climate Panel Violated Law</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 30-Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A U.S. District Court in Massachusetts ruled on January 30 that the Trump administration violated federal law when it secretly formed a &quot;Climate Working Group&quot; comprised of five climate change skeptics to write a report attacking climate science, with the court declaring the violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act are &quot;now established as a matter of law.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court&#39;s judgment determined that the Department of Energy, Secretary of Energy Wright, and the Climate Working Group violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) by forming and operating in secret without public disclosure, failing to maintain fairly balanced membership, and not making materials available to the public. The Climate Working Group was created in 2024 and tasked with writing a report that the Trump administration subsequently used as justification for proposing to overturn the EPA&#39;s Endangerment Finding—the scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare.</p>
<p>The Federal Advisory Committee Act was passed by Congress after Nixon-era scandals to prevent federal government advisory committees from forming or operating in secret. The law requires that advisory groups have fairly balanced membership and that materials created by such groups be available to the public. Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed the lawsuit alleging the Climate Working Group&#39;s creation violated these fundamental transparency and accountability requirements.</p>
<p>The ruling carries significant implications for the Trump administration&#39;s broader efforts to repeal climate protections based on the Climate Working Group&#39;s report. Legal experts suggested the decision could invalidate regulatory changes predicated on the group&#39;s conclusions, forcing the administration to restart policy development processes using properly constituted advisory bodies. The case highlights ongoing tensions between the administration&#39;s climate policy agenda and federal laws designed to ensure scientific integrity and public accountability in government decision-making.</p>
<h3>9. Indonesia and Australia Sign Historic Security Treaty on Common Defense</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indonesia and Australia signed a landmark security treaty on February 6 committing both nations to consult each other if either faces external threats, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and President Prabowo Subianto describing the Australia-Indonesia Treaty on Common Security as taking defense cooperation to unprecedented levels and reflecting deep bilateral trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treaty was signed in Jakarta on Friday, modeled after a 1995 security agreement between the two countries but significantly expanded in scope. While full details have not been disclosed, the pact commits Australia and Indonesia to mutual consultation in the event of threats to either nation&#39;s security, though it stops short of constituting a formal mutual defense alliance requiring automatic military assistance. The agreement represents the most significant bilateral defense commitment between the often-testy neighbors in decades.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Albanese announced supporting initiatives including development of joint defense training facilities in Indonesia, establishment of a new embedded position for a senior Indonesian military officer in the Australian Defence Force, and expansion of the Junior Leaders&#39; Forum Military Education Exchange to build ties between future military leaders. The measures aim to institutionalize defense cooperation beyond individual programs and create lasting structural linkages between the two militaries.</p>
<p>The treaty reflects both nations&#39; assessment of growing regional security challenges, particularly concerning Chinese military expansion in the South China Sea and broader Indo-Pacific power competition. For Australia, the agreement diversifies security partnerships beyond traditional alliances with the United States and other Five Eyes nations. For Indonesia, historically committed to non-alignment, the treaty signals willingness to accept greater security interdependence with a Western-aligned power while maintaining strategic autonomy. Regional analysts noted the treaty could serve as a template for other Southeast Asian nations seeking to balance relations between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<h3>10. Bangladesh Faces Election Violence as February 12 Parliamentary Vote Approaches</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8-12</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bangladesh&#39;s February 12 parliamentary elections are proceeding amid escalating political violence that has killed at least 16 activists since the vote was announced in December, with authorities deploying 900,000 security personnel including 108,730 military members to protect 42,761 polling centers in the country&#39;s first election since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&#39;s ouster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Widespread political violence has troubled Bangladesh&#39;s election preparations, with leaders from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jamaat-e-Islami, and other opposition parties killed in recent weeks. About 900,000 personnel will be deployed from February 8-14 to ensure security, with more than half of the country&#39;s polling centers classified as risky and receiving the bulk of additional security forces. The massive security deployment reflects the government&#39;s assessment that violence could escalate further as election day approaches.</p>
<p>A spate of recent attacks has amplified fears among Bangladesh&#39;s religious minorities, particularly the Hindu community, ahead of the February 12 vote. While the government insists most incidents have been ordinary crimes, minority leaders have documented a pattern of targeted intimidation and violence they attribute to political motives. The climate of fear has led some minority voters to question whether they can safely participate in the electoral process.</p>
<p>The election represents Bangladesh&#39;s first parliamentary vote since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party ruled for over a decade until mass protests forced her from power in 2025. Hasina, now in exile in India, has denounced the upcoming election and her party faces a ban from participating. The exclusion of the Awami League—historically one of Bangladesh&#39;s two dominant parties—raises questions about the legitimacy of the electoral outcome and the possibility of post-election instability, particularly if results are disputed or if violence against Awami League supporters or Hindu minorities intensifies.</p>

<h3>1. Cleveland-Cliffs and Becton Dickinson Report Earnings as February Reporting Season Continues</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and Becton, Dickinson and Company released Q4 2025 earnings before markets opened on Monday, February 9, with analysts expecting Cleveland-Cliffs to report a loss of $0.62 per share on $4.62 billion revenue while Becton Dickinson is forecast to post earnings of $2.82 per share on $5.15 billion revenue as 78 S&amp;P 500 companies report this week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cleveland-Cliffs announced full-year and fourth-quarter 2025 earnings results before the U.S. market open on Monday, with the steelmaker hosting a conference call with securities analysts and institutional investors at 8:30 am ET. Analysts expected Cleveland-Cliffs to report a loss per share of $0.62 and $4.62 billion in revenue, reflecting ongoing challenges in the steel industry from weak demand in key end markets and elevated input costs that have compressed margins throughout 2025.</p>
<p>Becton, Dickinson and Company released its Q1 2026 results before market open on Monday, with the earnings call scheduled for 8:00 AM ET. Analysts expected the medical technology company to post earnings of $2.82 per share and revenue of $5.15 billion for the quarter. The results will provide insight into demand trends for medical devices, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical systems across both developed and emerging markets.</p>
<p>During the upcoming week, 78 S&amp;P 500 companies (including 3 Dow 30 components) are scheduled to report results, with major corporations including Coca-Cola, CVS, AstraZeneca, and Ford releasing earnings on Tuesday, February 10. The February reporting season is being closely watched for signs of how companies are navigating a complex economic environment characterized by moderating inflation, slowing growth, and persistent consumer caution. Earnings guidance for full-year 2026 will be particularly scrutinized as investors assess whether companies can sustain profit margins amid wage pressures and potential tariff impacts.</p>
<h3>2. January Jobs Report Rescheduled for February 11 Following Shutdown Delay</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4-11</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics rescheduled the January employment report to Wednesday, February 11—five days later than originally planned—due to a government shutdown delay, with economists forecasting nonfarm payroll growth of 60,000 to 80,000 jobs and unemployment holding steady at 4.4% as labor market balance remains a critical Federal Reserve policy consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The January jobs report will be released on February 11 following a government shutdown that disrupted the original release schedule. According to FactSet, nonfarm payroll employment is forecast to increase by 80,000 in January versus 50,000 in December, while economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a gain of 60,000 jobs. The wide range of estimates reflects uncertainty about seasonal adjustment factors and the impact of winter weather on hiring patterns.</p>
<p>The report is projected to show that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.4%, with wage growth also likely to remain stable, signaling a labor market in balance as weak hiring matches a slow-growing workforce. The jobs report is expected to show continued gradual cooling from the tight labor conditions of 2022-2023 without deteriorating into recessionary territory, a &quot;soft landing&quot; scenario the Federal Reserve has been attempting to engineer through its interest rate policy.</p>
<p>The delayed January jobs report and upcoming February 13 CPI release (showing inflation data also postponed by the shutdown) represent critical data points for Federal Reserve policymakers as they assess the appropriate path for monetary policy in 2026. Markets are currently pricing in two rate cuts for 2026, with the first likely in June, though the timing depends heavily on whether inflation continues to moderate and employment remains stable. The labor market data will be particularly important given recent weak readings on job openings and jobless claims that have raised concerns about potential deterioration.</p>
<h3>3. ON Semiconductor Reports Q4 Earnings Amid Technology Sector Volatility</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ON Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, February 9, with analysts expecting earnings of $0.62 per share on revenue of $1.54 billion as the semiconductor manufacturer navigates challenges including an 11.98% revenue decline and margin pressures that have left the stock with a neutral rating from analysts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ON Semiconductor released quarterly earnings during market hours on Monday, with the company facing heightened scrutiny amid broader semiconductor sector volatility and concerns about demand trends for automotive and industrial chips. Analysts expected the company to announce earnings of $0.62 per share and revenue of $1.54 billion for the quarter, representing continued pressure on the company&#39;s financial performance.</p>
<p>Examining ON Semiconductor&#39;s financials over the prior three months revealed significant challenges, with the company experiencing a revenue decline of approximately 11.98% as of September 30, 2025. Additionally, ON Semiconductor&#39;s net margin of 16.44% lags behind industry averages, suggesting difficulties in maintaining strong profitability amid competitive pressures and pricing headwinds in key markets. The company&#39;s recent performance included a +6.78% EPS surprise and +1.97% revenue surprise in its most recent prior report, though the stock price declined 3.59% following that release.</p>
<p>With 8 analyst ratings, ON Semiconductor has a consensus rating of Neutral with an average one-year price target of $62.12, indicating minimal expected upside from current levels. The cautious analyst stance reflects concerns about the company&#39;s exposure to automotive semiconductor markets where electric vehicle demand has moderated and traditional auto production remains sluggish. The earnings report comes as the broader semiconductor sector faces questions about the sustainability of AI-driven growth and whether infrastructure spending will translate into sustained revenue growth for chip manufacturers.</p>
<h3>4. Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations Set for June as Markets Price Two Cuts in 2026</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Financial markets are pricing in two Federal Reserve rate cuts of 25 basis points each for 2026, with the first reduction most likely in June and a second potentially in September, as policymakers balance persistent 3% inflation against signs of labor market softening and moderating economic growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady in a range between 3.5% and 3.75% at its January 2026 meeting, pausing after recent cuts and signaling a cautious approach to further easing. Futures markets are pricing in at most two rate reductions in 2026, with the Fed&#39;s own projections indicating only one rate cut for the year—less than market participants expect. The divergence between market pricing and Fed guidance reflects ongoing uncertainty about the inflation trajectory and economic resilience.</p>
<p>One notable outlier is Moody&#39;s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, who expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear. Zandi&#39;s forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, predicting that labor market weakness and disinflation will force the Fed&#39;s hand earlier and more aggressively than currently anticipated. However, most analysts remain skeptical of such an aggressive easing path given that inflation is still running closer to 3% than the Fed&#39;s 2% goal.</p>
<p>Markets are expecting the Fed to wait until at least June before adjusting its benchmark rate again, with any earlier move dependent on either a sharp deterioration in employment data or an unexpected acceleration in disinflation. The Fed faces a delicate balancing act: labor market weakness that justifies rate cuts versus persistent inflation concerns that argue for maintaining restrictive monetary policy. Federal Reserve Chair Powell has stated that the economy remains on &quot;firm footing&quot; and that the current rate level is not necessarily restrictive, comments that suggest the bar for further rate cuts may be higher than markets anticipate.</p>
<h3>5. Dollar Strength Pressures Commodities as Gold and Silver Retreat from Record Highs</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2-9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Bloomberg dollar gauge appreciated approximately 1.2% over recent sessions, pressuring commodity prices across the board as gold retreated from its record $5,594.82 per ounce peak and silver pulled back from an all-time high of $121.64, with easing geopolitical tensions and strong U.S. manufacturing data contributing to the dollar&#39;s strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commodity prices fell sharply in early February, with losses spanning precious metals, oil, and industrial metals as easing geopolitical tensions and a firmer U.S. dollar prompted investors to unwind defensive positions. The mechanism is straightforward: a stronger dollar typically makes commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, dampening demand and creating selling pressure. The dollar&#39;s recent appreciation followed unexpectedly strong U.S. manufacturing data and signs of diplomatic progress on Middle East tensions.</p>
<p>Despite the recent pullback, precious metals had experienced extraordinary gains in January, with gold surging to a record $5,594.82 an ounce and silver reaching an all-time high of $121.64. These levels proved vulnerable to profit-taking once the dollar strengthened and immediate geopolitical crisis scenarios appeared less likely. UBS sees gold consolidating in the $4,500-4,800 per ounce range in the near term but expects it to rise to $6,200 per ounce by mid-year, supported by various factors including central bank demand, geopolitical risks, and concerns about fiscal sustainability.</p>
<p>Continued dollar weakness earlier in 2026 had acted as a tailwind to commodity prices, supported by fiscal concerns, geopolitical tensions, and strong demand. Market leadership shifted from mega-cap technology in 2025 as markets transitioned to a more balanced environment across market cap size and economic sectors, with commodity-linked equities benefiting from this rotation. Looking ahead, commodity price trajectories will depend heavily on the dollar&#39;s path, which in turn hinges on Federal Reserve policy decisions, U.S. economic data, and the evolution of global trade and geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h3>6. Stock Market Outlook Focuses on Jobs Report and CPI Data for Week of February 9-12</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9-12</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The week of February 9-12 will see critical economic data releases including the delayed January jobs report on Wednesday and continued corporate earnings, with markets looking for confirmation that the labor market remains stable and inflation continues moderating to support expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monday, February 9 features earnings reports from UDR, Principal Financial Group, ON Semiconductor, Cincinnati Financial, Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., Apollo Global Management, Waters, and Loews, with many more earnings scheduled throughout the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 for the first time ever after rallying more than 1,200 points on Friday, February 7, while the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped more than 2% in a broad-based rally that recovered much of the prior week&#39;s losses.</p>
<p>The big jobs report Wednesday is expected to show the U.S. added 60,000 jobs last month, up from an increase of 50,000 in December, with the unemployment rate forecast to stay unchanged at 4.4%. The employment data will be critical for assessing whether the labor market is achieving a sustainable balance or deteriorating in ways that might force earlier Federal Reserve intervention. January CPI data, also delayed by the shutdown, is expected to show inflation increasing 0.29% monthly and 2.5% annually, an improvement from December though still short of the Federal Reserve&#39;s 2% target.</p>
<p>Market leadership has shifted from mega-cap technology in 2025 as markets have transitioned to a more balanced environment across market cap size and economic sectors. Additionally, continued dollar weakness has boosted commodities prices, most notably in precious metals, though this trend reversed in early February. The market is still pricing in two Fed rate cuts for 2026, more than the central bank has indicated it might deliver, setting up potential disappointment if inflation proves stickier than expected or if the Fed maintains its cautious stance on easing.</p>
<h3>7. Israel Continues Air Strikes on Lebanon Despite November 2024 Ceasefire Agreement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2-9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Israeli military forces struck several locations in southern Lebanon on February 2, including villages where evacuation warnings were issued, claiming to hit Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, as more than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire since the November 2024 ceasefire—with Hezbollah launching only one attack in response despite over 11,000 Israeli violations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Israel&#39;s military struck multiple locations in south Lebanon on Monday, February 2, including in two villages where it issued evacuation warnings, claiming it was hitting Hezbollah targets. The Israeli military stated it struck &quot;several Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in southern Lebanon, in order to prevent re-establishment attempts.&quot; The Lebanese health ministry reported that an Israeli strike on Ansariyeh in southern Lebanon killed one person and wounded four others, while another strike on Qleileh wounded an additional four people.</p>
<p>Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war between Israel and the Iran-backed group, Israel has kept up regular strikes on parts of Lebanon and has maintained troops in five border areas it deems strategic. More than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire, according to an AFP tally of health ministry reports. The Lebanese group Hezbollah has launched only one attack in the 14 months since the ceasefire began, despite more than 11,000 Israeli violations documented by observers.</p>
<p>In January, Lebanon&#39;s army announced completion of the first phase of its plan to disarm Hezbollah, covering the area south of the Litani river approximately 30 kilometers from the Israeli border. Israel, which accuses Hezbollah of rearming, has criticized the army&#39;s progress as insufficient, while Hezbollah has rejected calls to surrender its weapons entirely. The ongoing strikes and counteraccusations raise questions about the sustainability of the ceasefire and the possibility of renewed large-scale conflict if tensions continue to escalate.</p>
<h3>8. 2026 Winter Olympics: Breezy Johnson Wins Downhill Gold as Lindsey Vonn Suffers Catastrophic Crash</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>American skier Breezy Johnson captured gold in the women&#39;s downhill at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics on February 8, marking the first U.S. medal of the Games, in a race marred by a devastating crash involving teammate Lindsey Vonn who was competing just days after suffering an ACL tear and required emergency surgery for a broken leg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breezy Johnson won gold in the women&#39;s downhill race, reclaiming the narrative on the iconic Cortina slope where she crashed while training four years earlier, ending her hopes of competing in the 2022 Winter Games. Johnson&#39;s victory represented a remarkable comeback story and gave the United States its first medal of the 2026 Olympics. Hours after the event, Johnson revealed that part of her gold medal broke off while she was celebrating the victory, stating &quot;Well, I was jumping up and down in excitement, and it fell off.&quot;</p>
<p>The race was marred by Lindsey Vonn&#39;s attempt to compete despite having ruptured her ACL just over a week prior. Just 13.4 seconds into her run, Vonn&#39;s right arm snagged a gate, sending her spinning in the air into a dramatic crash on the slope. Vonn was evacuated from the mountain by helicopter and required surgery on her broken left leg. The decision to allow Vonn to compete despite her recent injury has sparked intense debate about athlete safety protocols and whether medical clearances were appropriately rigorous.</p>
<p>The U.S. team also won gold in team figure skating on Day 2 of the Olympics, adding to the nation&#39;s medal count in the early stages of the Milan Cortina Games. The Winter Olympics continue through February 22, with competitions across alpine skiing, snowboarding, ice hockey, figure skating, and numerous other winter sports disciplines. The Games have proceeded despite concerns about warm weather affecting snow conditions at some venues and ongoing debates about the environmental sustainability of hosting winter sports events amid accelerating climate change.</p>
<h3>9. Coca-Cola and Major Corporations Report Earnings Week of February 10</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 10</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coca-Cola is scheduled to report Q4 2025 earnings on Tuesday, February 10, before market open, with analysts expecting earnings per share of $0.56 as the beverage giant navigates shifting consumer preferences, pricing power limitations, and international currency headwinds in a challenging macroeconomic environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coca-Cola will release Q4 2025 earnings on Tuesday, February 10, 2026, before market open, joining a wave of major corporations reporting results this week. Analysts expect the company to announce earnings of $0.56 per share, with investors closely watching for commentary on volume trends, pricing strategies, and international market performance. The earnings will provide insight into how consumer staples companies are managing the tension between maintaining margins through pricing power and preserving volume in the face of inflation-weary consumers.</p>
<p>Also reporting earnings on February 10 are CVS, AstraZeneca, and Ford, offering perspectives from the pharmacy retail, pharmaceutical, and automotive sectors respectively. The diverse range of reporting companies will provide a broad snapshot of the U.S. and global economy, with particular focus on consumer spending patterns, healthcare utilization trends, and automotive demand. Investors will scrutinize guidance for full-year 2026 to assess whether companies see improving conditions or continued headwinds.</p>
<p>The earnings season so far has been characterized by significant volatility, with software stocks experiencing historic selloffs while &quot;old economy&quot; sectors like materials, energy, and industrials have outperformed. Overall, 59% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported to date beat earnings expectations, with 76% reporting actual EPS above mean estimates. However, the forward guidance has been mixed, with some companies expressing caution about 2026 prospects while others remain confident in sustained demand.</p>
<h3>10. U.S. Stock Market Crosses 50,000 Threshold Amid Rotation from Technology to Value Sectors</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7-9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 50,000 for the first time on Friday, February 7, rallying more than 1,200 points in a session that saw the S&amp;P 500 rise nearly 2% and the Nasdaq jump over 2%, though the S&amp;P 500 remains in negative territory for 2026 with approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization wiped out during recent volatility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 for the first time ever after rallying more than 1,200 points on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 rising nearly 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumping more than 2%. The broad-based rally represented a sharp reversal from the previous week&#39;s technology-led selloff and was driven by strength in the beaten-down tech sector alongside gains in industrials, materials, and energy. However, the S&amp;P 500 Index remains red for 2026, having wiped out roughly $1 trillion in market capitalization during the recent volatility.</p>
<p>The U.S. stock market is witnessing a massive sector rotation as billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into &quot;Old Economy&quot; value sectors of basic materials, energy, and industrials. Small-cap value stocks are up 5.94% in 2026 compared to large-cap growth at 2.80%, representing a reversal of last year&#39;s dynamic where mega-cap technology dominated returns. Several sectors hit fresh all-time highs this week, including industrials, materials, energy, and consumer staples.</p>
<p>The market rotation reflects investor reassessment of which companies have sustainable business models versus those built primarily on growth narratives, with Wall Street&#39;s shift into value drawing comparisons to the dot-com bust aftermath. The volatility has been particularly acute in software stocks, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling it &quot;the worst structural sell-off in software I&#39;ve ever seen in 25 years&quot; as fears mount that AI tools could disrupt traditional enterprise software business models. Looking ahead, the market direction will depend heavily on upcoming economic data, corporate earnings guidance, and Federal Reserve policy signals.</p>

<h3>1. New START Nuclear Treaty Expires, Ending Last US-Russia Arms Control Agreement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The landmark New START treaty officially expired on February 5, leaving the world&#39;s two largest nuclear superpowers without binding limits on strategic nuclear weapons for the first time in decades, as President Trump called for a &quot;new, improved and modernised&quot; replacement while UN Secretary-General warned of a &quot;grave moment&quot; for global security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treaty, which limited each nation to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 700 deployed delivery systems, could not be extended because it permitted only one five-year extension—which was exercised in 2021. Today, there are no negotiations underway, and none are even planned, leaving the arms control architecture that helped prevent nuclear escalation during the Cold War in ruins.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the expiration represents a critical juncture for international peace and security, as binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons fall away amid heightened global tensions. Without New START, arms control experts warn that both nations could hedge against uncertainty by expanding their arsenals over time, potentially triggering unrestricted nuclear competition not seen since the 1960s.</p>
<p>President Trump stated that &quot;we should have our nuclear experts work on a new, improved and modernised treaty,&quot; but provided no details on timeline or negotiating framework. Russia has repeatedly indicated it will not engage in arms control talks while the US supports Ukraine militarily, creating a diplomatic impasse that leaves the world entering uncharted territory without legally binding constraints on the arsenals that contain 90% of global nuclear weapons.</p>
<h3>2. United States Accuses China of Secret 2020 Nuclear Test, Presses for Trilateral Arms Treaty</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration accused China of conducting a secret nuclear explosive test in June 2020 and using &quot;decoupling&quot; techniques to hide it from international monitors, as Washington called for a new trilateral arms control agreement including Russia and China to replace the expired New START framework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Thomas DiNanno made the allegations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, stating that China sought to conceal the June 22, 2020 explosion by &quot;obfuscating the explosions&quot; through methods designed to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring. The timing of the accusation—just one day after New START expired—appeared calculated to build pressure for Beijing to join arms control negotiations.</p>
<p>However, the allegations faced immediate contradiction from international monitoring organizations. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization stated its system &quot;did not detect any event consistent with the characteristics of a nuclear weapon test explosion&quot; on June 22, 2020, with subsequent analyses not altering that determination. The discrepancy raised questions about US intelligence assessments and diplomatic strategy.</p>
<p>China&#39;s Embassy spokesperson rejected the allegations, stating that China &quot;follows a policy of &#39;no first use&#39; of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense, and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium.&quot; Beijing has repeatedly refused to participate in arms control negotiations, arguing that such treaties would unfairly constrain its military development and prevent it from achieving parity with the US and Russia, whose arsenals are roughly ten times larger than China&#39;s estimated 500 warheads.</p>
<h3>3. Congress Passes $50 Billion Foreign Aid Bill Despite Trump&#39;s Proposed 79% Cut</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress allocated $50 billion for foreign aid in fiscal year 2026—a 16% reduction from 2025 levels—rejecting the Trump administration&#39;s budget request for just $31 billion that would have represented a 79% cut when including proposed rescissions and cancellations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislation brings an end to most forms of traditional US civilian assistance and formally shutters the US Agency for International Development (USAID), redirecting tens of billions of dollars toward domestic priorities, border enforcement, and selected security commitments. The budget eliminates $6.2 billion in global health spending, $3.2 billion in humanitarian aid, and $1.6 billion in food assistance provisions that had been cornerstones of American development policy for decades.</p>
<p>In place of traditional development aid, the legislation creates the America First Opportunity Fund, a $2.9 billion program restricted to expenditures that directly advance US economic or national security interests. The shift represents a fundamental reorientation of American foreign policy away from soft power investments and toward transactional relationships focused on immediate strategic returns.</p>
<p>While Congress provided significantly more funding than the administration requested, the $50 billion still marks a dramatic retreat from the $58.8 billion allocated in fiscal year 2025. Development advocates warned that the cuts will undermine America&#39;s ability to compete with China&#39;s Belt and Road Initiative, damage relationships with developing nations, and create humanitarian crises that could ultimately require more expensive military interventions.</p>
<h3>4. Syrian Government and Kurdish SDF Implement Ceasefire Agreement in Al-Hasakah</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Syrian army moved into the northeastern city of Al-Hasakah under a US-backed ceasefire agreement with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, beginning a gradual integration process that could reshape the balance of power in northeastern Syria after years of autonomous Kurdish administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 30, the Syrian transitional government announced it had reached a comprehensive agreement with the SDF including a ceasefire, gradual military and administrative integration, deployment of Interior Ministry forces in Al-Hasakah and Qamishli, integration of local institutions into the state, guarantees of civil and educational rights for the Kurdish community, and the return of displaced persons. On February 2, General Security Service forces began deploying to implement the framework.</p>
<p>The United States hailed the agreement as a historic milestone toward unity and reconciliation after 14 years of war. The deal establishes a framework for incorporating SDF fighters into Syria&#39;s national army and police forces while integrating civilian institutions controlled by the group into the central government structure—a process that will test whether Damascus can accommodate Kurdish autonomy demands while asserting sovereignty.</p>
<p>The implementation comes as Turkey continues to pressure Kurdish forces along Syria&#39;s northern border, creating a complex three-way dynamic between Damascus, Ankara, and Washington. The outcome will significantly impact regional stability, the future of US military presence in eastern Syria, and the broader question of how post-civil war Syria manages its diverse ethnic and political factions.</p>
<h3>5. Pakistan Concludes Massive Balochistan Counterterrorism Operation, 216 Militants Killed</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pakistan&#39;s military concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1, a week-long counterterrorism campaign in Balochistan province that killed 216 militants of the Balochistan Liberation Army following coordinated attacks on security installations, a high-security prison, and civilian areas across the province.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The operation was launched on January 29 in response to BLA&#39;s &quot;Operation Herof 2.0,&quot; which involved armed assaults and suicide bombings targeting security installations, police stations, and civilian areas. Multiple attacks were attempted and carried out in Quetta, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kalat, Gwadar, Pasni, Tump, and Mastung. Around 31 civilians and 22 security personnel were also killed during the violence that triggered the military response.</p>
<p>Pakistani security forces stated that the 40-hour operation resulted in the deaths of 216 militants and insurgents, according to the Armed Forces&#39; media wing, the ISPR. The offensive included deployment of helicopters and drones to end the standoff with Baloch rebels, with the government accusing India of backing the separatist movement—claims that New Delhi has consistently denied.</p>
<p>The attacks and subsequent military operation were widely condemned by China, France, Turkey, the US Embassy, and the UN Security Council. The violence highlights the persistent insurgency in Pakistan&#39;s largest but least developed province, where separatist groups have waged a decades-long campaign for independence, citing exploitation of natural resources and political marginalization by the central government.</p>
<h3>6. Costa Rica Elects First Female President Since 2010 in First-Round Victory</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laura Fernández Delgado of the ruling Sovereign People&#39;s Party won Costa Rica&#39;s presidential election with 48.30% of the vote, exceeding the 40% threshold required to avoid a runoff and becoming the Central American nation&#39;s second female president after Laura Chinchilla (2010-2014).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The February 1 elections saw Fernández defeat Álvaro Ramos Chaves of the National Liberation Party and 18 other candidates in a contest that centered on security, economic growth, and the controversial legacy of outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves. Her party also secured a commanding majority in the Legislative Assembly with 31 of 57 seats, against the PLN&#39;s 17, giving her government significant power to implement its agenda.</p>
<p>Fernández will be sworn in on May 8, 2026, continuing the aggressive reorienting of Costa Rican politics started by her political sponsor President Chaves. Her victory reflects voter support for the PPSO&#39;s conservative populist platform, which emphasizes law enforcement, economic development, and a nationalist approach to foreign policy—a departure from Costa Rica&#39;s traditional moderate centrism.</p>
<p>The election took place amid heightened political tensions in Central America, with neighboring countries experiencing democratic backsliding and increased Chinese influence in the region. How Fernández balances relations between Washington and Beijing while managing domestic economic challenges will define her presidency and Costa Rica&#39;s role in a strategically contested region.</p>
<h3>7. Record Snowstorm Kills 45 in Japan, Self-Defense Forces Deploy for First Time in 21 Years</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japan deployed Self-Defense Forces to Aomori Prefecture for the first time in 21 years as record-breaking snowfall killed at least 45 people and injured over 500 since January 20, with many victims suffering fatal falls while attempting to clear snow from roofs or heart attacks from extreme physical exertion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The death toll varies across reports, with Japan&#39;s Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirming at least 30 deaths and 324 injuries as of early February, while more recent tallies exceed 45 fatalities and 500 injuries. Niigata Prefecture saw the highest death toll with 12 fatalities, followed by six deaths in Akita Prefecture and four in Aomori Prefecture, with most occurring when people attempted to remove accumulated snow from around their homes.</p>
<p>Many victims suffered sudden heart attacks due to extreme physical exhaustion during snow removal, while others died after slipping from building roofs or being buried by snow that slid from high places. The severity of the storm prompted the unprecedented military deployment to assist with snow removal and emergency operations in communities cut off by drifts exceeding three meters in some mountain valleys.</p>
<p>The snowfall represents one of the deadliest winter weather events in modern Japanese history, highlighting the vulnerability of rural and mountain communities to extreme weather despite Japan&#39;s advanced infrastructure and disaster preparedness systems. Climate scientists note that warming atmospheric patterns can paradoxically increase heavy snowfall events in some regions through enhanced moisture transport.</p>
<h3>8. Washington Post Lays Off One-Third of Newsroom, Eliminates Sports and Foreign Bureaus</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Washington Post laid off nearly 300 of its roughly 800 journalists—one-third of the newsroom—eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus, and books coverage in the most extensive cuts at the storied newspaper in years as owner Jeff Bezos restructures the organization amid sustained financial losses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Executive Editor Matt Murray announced the layoffs during a Zoom call with employees, stating that the changes are necessary after years of financial challenges. Murray noted that the media environment has evolved greatly, with search traffic that once helped the paper &quot;thrive&quot; now in decline due to the growth of artificial intelligence—organic search traffic has fallen by nearly half in the last three years alone.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging job losses primarily affected sports, books, and podcast units, with foreign desks also heavily impacted, along with cuts to business and national teams. The Washington Post Guild stated that the outlet&#39;s workforce had shrunk by 400 people in the past three years, representing a wholesale transformation of one of America&#39;s most influential news organizations.</p>
<p>The layoffs mark the culmination of a difficult period for the Post that has included leadership turnover, controversial editorial decisions, and subscriber losses following the newspaper&#39;s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. The cuts reflect broader challenges facing legacy media as digital advertising revenues decline, subscription growth stagnates, and AI-powered search threatens to disintermediate news organizations from their audiences.</p>
<h3>9. Myanmar Junta Creates Union Consultative Council to Maintain Military Control After Elections</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myanmar&#39;s military leader Min Aung Hlaing signed the Union Consultative Council Law, creating a powerful new body that will provide &quot;guidance and coordination&quot; on security, foreign relations, and legislative matters—a mechanism analysts say allows him to retain decisive authority even if he does not directly hold the presidency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Union Consultative Council was formally proposed on February 3 after the conclusion of Myanmar&#39;s 2025-26 general election, which saw the military-backed party declared the winner in voting that ASEAN and international observers refused to recognize as legitimate. Under the new legislation, the council is formed by the president and must include a minimum of five members, including a chairperson and secretary.</p>
<p>Critics point out that the law&#39;s provisions effectively place the council above the president in influence but below the president in formal authority, creating a position—that of council chief—that could allow Min Aung Hlaing to consolidate power around himself even in a nominal civilian government. The structure mirrors arrangements used by military regimes to maintain control while creating a facade of democratic governance.</p>
<p>The new consultative council law is widely interpreted as a pre-emptive move to ensure military dominance as Myanmar remains mired in civil war nearly five years after the February 2021 coup. Resistance forces control significant territory across the country, the economy has collapsed, and international isolation has deepened—yet the junta shows no signs of relinquishing power or engaging in meaningful political dialogue.</p>
<h3>10. Storm Leonardo Kills Two, Forces 11,000 Evacuations Across Spain and Portugal</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storm Leonardo battered the Iberian Peninsula with more than 40 centimeters of rain in 24 hours, killing at least two people—one in Portugal and one in Spain—and forcing more than 11,000 residents to evacuate their homes as emergency services dealt with over 3,300 incidents including flooding, falling trees, and landslides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A man in his 60s was killed after being swept away by floodwaters while attempting to drive across a flooded area in southeastern Portugal. In southern Spain&#39;s Malaga province, a girl remains missing after being dragged away by the Turvilla River in Sayalonga while trying to rescue her dog. Emergency responders continue search operations despite dangerous conditions and receding floodwaters complicating recovery efforts.</p>
<p>The storm brought added hardship for Portugal, which was still reeling from Storm Kristin the previous week, which killed at least five people, injured hundreds, and cut off tens of thousands from the power grid. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro estimated damage from the consecutive storms exceeded four billion euros ($4.7 billion), putting enormous strain on emergency services and disaster relief budgets.</p>
<p>Portugal extended its state of emergency amid the destruction brought by Storm Leonardo, with meteorologists warning that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events. The back-to-back storms overwhelmed drainage systems, triggered devastating mudslides, and demonstrated the vulnerability of Mediterranean infrastructure to intensifying Atlantic storm systems.</p>
<h3>11. Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard Seizes Two Oil Tankers in Persian Gulf Over Fuel Smuggling</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard Navy seized two foreign oil tankers carrying approximately 1 million liters of fuel near Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf, detaining 15 crew members on fuel smuggling charges just one day before scheduled high-level nuclear talks with the United States in Muscat, Oman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tankers were carrying about 6,300 barrels of fuel including diesel and were transferred to Bushehr after being seized on Thursday. Iranian authorities did not provide the nationality of the tankers or specify what flags they were flying, nor did they disclose the nationalities of the 15 crew members taken into custody by judicial bodies for investigation.</p>
<p>The seizure comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington following Iran&#39;s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests and the Trump administration&#39;s deployment of significant military forces to the region. Iran occasionally seizes oil-carrying vessels in the Persian Gulf over smuggling charges, though the timing—just before nuclear negotiations—appeared designed to demonstrate Iran&#39;s control over the strategic waterway.</p>
<p>The incident highlights the fragility of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate US-Iran tensions, with both sides engaging in shows of force even as they pursue negotiations. The Strait of Hormuz and surrounding waters remain one of the world&#39;s most critical energy chokepoints, with roughly one-fifth of global oil supply transiting the narrow passage, making any disruption a matter of international economic concern.</p>
<h3>12. Nigerian Forces Kill Senior Boko Haram Commander in Sambisa Forest Raid</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nigeria&#39;s military announced the death of Abu Khalid, described as Boko Haram&#39;s deputy leader in the Sambisa Forest, along with ten other militants during a Saturday night raid in the Kodunga area of Borno State, recovering weapons, food items, and medical supplies from the extremist group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Army spokesman Sani Uba identified Abu Khalid as a key figure within &quot;the terrorist hierarchy, coordinating operations and logistics in the Sambisa axis.&quot; The operation targeted a Boko Haram command post that had been used to plan attacks across northeastern Nigeria, where the Islamic extremist group has waged an insurgency since 2009 that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions.</p>
<p>The raid represents part of Nigeria&#39;s ongoing counterterrorism efforts in the Lake Chad Basin region, where Boko Haram and its Islamic State-affiliated splinter group ISWAP continue to mount attacks despite years of military pressure. The Sambisa Forest has served as a primary stronghold for the militants, providing dense vegetation cover and proximity to civilian populations that complicate military operations.</p>
<p>While Nigerian authorities have announced the deaths of senior Boko Haram commanders numerous times over the years, the group has demonstrated resilience through decentralized leadership and continued ability to recruit from marginalized communities. The killing of Abu Khalid, if confirmed, would represent a tactical victory but is unlikely to fundamentally alter the conflict dynamics without broader efforts to address the poverty, governance failures, and ethnic tensions that fuel the insurgency.</p>
<h3>13. Sudan Forces Break Two-Year Siege of Kadugli, Advance in South Kordofan</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sudanese Armed Forces announced they opened a road into Kadugli, breaking through an over two-year siege and achieving their second major advance in South Kordofan in as many weeks, as the brutal civil war between SAF and the Rapid Support Forces enters its third year with no diplomatic resolution in sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conflict continues to escalate across multiple frontlines as both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces seek to consolidate territorial control through ground operations, artillery shelling, heavy drone strikes, and aerial bombardments. The Kordofan region has emerged as a key epicenter of hostilities, while fighting persists in North Darfur and Sennar states.</p>
<p>On January 11, the SAF announced the official return of national institutions to the capital, Khartoum, after recapturing the city in March 2025 from RSF forces that had seized control in April 2023 when the conflict erupted. The government had relocated to Port Sudan following the outbreak of the war that has devastated Africa&#39;s third-largest nation.</p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis continues to worsen, with an estimated 33.7 million people—around two-thirds of Sudan&#39;s population—expected to need humanitarian assistance in 2026. More than 20 million require health assistance, while 21 million face acute food insecurity. Sudan represents the world&#39;s largest displacement crisis, with 13.6 million people uprooted—9.3 million internally displaced and 4.3 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Overcrowded conditions and disrupted services have fueled outbreaks of cholera, malaria, dengue, and measles across much of the country.</p>
<h3>14. Trump Cuts India Tariffs to 18% After Modi Pledges to Halt Russian Oil Purchases</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump announced he would slash US tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% and remove a separate 25% Russia-related duty after Prime Minister Modi pledged to stop buying Russian oil and committed to purchasing more than $500 billion worth of American energy, technology, agricultural, and other products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trade deal ended months of escalating tensions between the two countries, with the administration also rescinding punitive tariffs imposed over India&#39;s purchases of Russian oil that had stacked on top of reciprocal tariff rates. Indian markets surged on the announcement, with the Nifty 50 jumping nearly 5% and the rupee strengthening to 90.40—its best day since November 2022—as trade war fears eased dramatically.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Modi notably welcomed the reduced tariffs in a post on social media but did not mention cutting purchases of Russian oil, raising questions about the specifics of the agreement. Nevertheless, India has begun slowing oil purchases from Russia, with January imports around 1.2 million barrels per day and projections showing declines to about 1 million bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned that legally binding text has yet to materialize, and implementation details remain unclear. The 18% US tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors in the battle for American market access, but whether the deal can withstand political scrutiny in both countries—particularly regarding the Russian oil commitment and agricultural tariff eliminations—will determine its longevity and economic impact.</p>
<h3>15. European Central Bank Holds Rates at 2% for Fifth Consecutive Meeting Amid Uncertain Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank maintained its key policy rate at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, with policymakers emphasizing that inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move despite eurozone inflation cooling to 1.7% in January—below the ECB&#39;s 2% target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision comes amid heightened economic uncertainty, with ECB officials monitoring the euro&#39;s recent appreciation and its potential disinflationary effects on the economy. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll predicted the ECB would leave rates unchanged for the remainder of 2026, reflecting expectations that inflation will remain contained even as growth remains subdued.</p>
<p>The ECB&#39;s cautious stance contrasts with more aggressive rate-cutting cycles in some other major economies but aligns with the Bank of England, which also held rates at 3.75% in February by a narrow 5-4 vote. The close vote reflects divisions on the committee about when to begin cutting rates, with some policymakers concerned about persistent services inflation while others worry about weak economic growth across the eurozone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve held its policy rate at 3.5-3.75% in late January, with Chairman Powell emphasizing that economic activity remains solid and the balance of risks to the Fed&#39;s dual mandate is improving. The divergent monetary policy paths across major central banks reflect different inflation dynamics, labor market conditions, and growth trajectories as the global economy navigates the post-pandemic adjustment period.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Alphabet Projects $185 Billion AI Capex for 2026, Doubling Annual Investment</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&#39;s parent company reported record fourth-quarter earnings while announcing capital expenditure plans of $175-185 billion for 2026—more than double its $91.4 billion spend in 2025—marking the largest capital expenditure commitment ever announced by a technology company as CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the AI infrastructure investment is keeping him awake at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alphabet beat Wall Street expectations with Q4 2025 earnings per share of $2.82 versus $2.63 estimated and revenue of $113.83 billion versus $111.43 billion expected. Annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time, with net income growing 15% to $132.2 billion. Google Cloud revenues surged 48% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, driven by enterprise AI adoption and infrastructure services.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s Gemini AI app reached more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million in the previous quarter. Alphabet achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency gains, and improved utilization. Approximately 60% of Q4 capex was invested in servers, with 40% allocated to data centers and networking equipment.</p>
<p>Despite strong operational performance, shares traded relatively flat as investors weighed the enormous spending commitment against uncertain returns on AI infrastructure. The guidance implies Alphabet is betting hundreds of billions of dollars that AI will transform internet services, cloud computing, and advertising—a wager that could reshape the technology industry but carries significant execution risk if demand fails to materialize or competition erodes margins.</p>
<h3>2. Meta Surges 10% After Beating Expectations, Announces $115-135 Billion AI Spending Plan</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meta Platforms reported Q4 2025 earnings per share of $8.88—beating forecasts by 8.42%—and revenue of $59.9 billion representing 24% year-over-year growth, while announcing plans to spend $115-135 billion in capital expenditures for 2026 to build AI infrastructure, sending shares surging 10% in extended trading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta&#39;s advertising business generated $58.1 billion for the quarter, making up nearly 97% of total revenue, demonstrating continued dominance in digital advertising despite competition from TikTok and other platforms. Operating income reached $24.7 billion with a 41% margin, while net income hit $22.8 billion, reflecting the company&#39;s ability to monetize its massive user base across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.</p>
<p>For Q1 2026, Meta projected revenue between $53.5-56.5 billion, with full-year expenses estimated at $162-169 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized AI&#39;s transformative potential, noting that the company is planning significant investments in AI infrastructure and talent acquisition despite potential supply chain constraints limiting GPU availability from Nvidia and other chip manufacturers.</p>
<p>The results and guidance contrast sharply with broader tech sector volatility, positioning Meta as a winner in the AI infrastructure race as it builds capacity for both internal AI products and potential future monetization through AI-powered advertising, content recommendation, and business tools. The company&#39;s cash generation provides flexibility to invest aggressively while maintaining shareholder returns through its ongoing buyback program.</p>
<h3>3. Microsoft Stock Plunges 10% on Azure Growth Slowdown Despite Record Capital Spending</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft shares suffered their biggest single-day decline since 2020, falling 10% after reporting that Azure cloud growth slowed from 40% in Q1 to 39% in Q2, disappointing investors despite the company announcing record capital expenditures of $37.5 billion for the quarter—66% higher than the prior year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decline extended through the following trading days, with shares falling an additional 3.5% as analysts digested implications of slowing cloud growth amid surging AI infrastructure investment. Stifel downgraded the stock from buy to hold on February 5, warning that consensus expectations for 2027 &quot;are too optimistic&quot; given the gap between capex spending and revenue acceleration.</p>
<p>Azure growth is projected to decelerate further to 37-38% in fiscal Q3, forming a concerning trend for investors who had expected AI services to accelerate cloud revenue growth. CFO Amy Hood noted that about two-thirds of the $37.5 billion quarterly capex was spent on GPUs and CPUs to keep up with AI demand, raising questions about return on investment as infrastructure spending outpaces revenue growth.</p>
<p>The stock decline reflects growing investor skepticism about whether massive AI spending by hyperscale cloud providers will generate adequate returns, or if the industry is building excess capacity that could lead to price competition and margin compression. Microsoft&#39;s struggle to translate record AI investment into accelerating cloud growth has become a cautionary tale as the sector grapples with what some analysts call an &quot;AI infrastructure wall.&quot;</p>
<h3>4. Amazon Plummets 8% on $200 Billion AI Spending Forecast Despite Strong AWS Growth</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon shares tumbled 8% after the e-commerce and cloud giant reported Q4 earnings of $1.95 per share—narrowly missing the $1.97 consensus—and guided to capital expenditures potentially reaching $200 billion in 2026, more than double its 2025 spending, to build AI infrastructure for Amazon Web Services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the stock decline, AWS revenue grew robustly, maintaining its position as the market-leading cloud platform ahead of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The division continues to be Amazon&#39;s profit engine, generating operating margins significantly higher than the company&#39;s retail business, but the massive capex commitment raises questions about how long the AI spending surge can continue without more visible revenue acceleration.</p>
<p>The $200 billion guidance represents one of the largest capital investment programs in corporate history, rivaling or exceeding commitments from Alphabet and Meta as tech giants race to build the infrastructure necessary for training and deploying next-generation AI models. Approximately 60-70% of the spending will go toward securing GPU inventory from Nvidia, AMD, and potentially custom silicon from Amazon&#39;s own chip design teams.</p>
<p>Analysts questioned whether customer demand for AI services justifies the enormous infrastructure buildout, or whether hyperscalers are engaging in a prisoner&#39;s dilemma where none can afford to fall behind in capacity even if overall industry returns remain uncertain. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky defended the spending as necessary to meet &quot;significant cloud customer demand&quot; but acknowledged that near-term margin pressure is inevitable.</p>
<h3>5. S&amp;P 500 Earnings Growth Hits 13% in Q4 2025, Tenth Consecutive Quarter of Expansion</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corporate America reported blended earnings growth of 13.0% for the fourth quarter of 2025, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of annual earnings expansion and the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth, as 76% of companies reporting beat analyst expectations despite macroeconomic headwinds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With 59% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported Q4 results, companies are delivering earnings that are 7.6% above estimates in aggregate, demonstrating continued resilience in corporate profitability. Ten sectors are reporting year-over-year revenue growth, led by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Health Care sectors, with technology sector earnings exploding 25% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts are projecting earnings growth rates of 11.3% for Q1 2026 and 14.9% for Q2 2026, with full calendar year 2026 expected to deliver 14.1% earnings expansion. The optimistic forecasts reflect expectations that AI-driven productivity gains, moderating inflation, and potential interest rate cuts will support profit margins even as revenue growth faces tougher comparisons.</p>
<p>However, the earnings strength masks significant divergence between AI beneficiaries and the broader market. Technology giants investing heavily in AI infrastructure are reporting explosive revenue and profit growth, while traditional cyclical sectors face margin pressure from tariffs, wage inflation, and slowing global demand. The concentration of earnings growth in a handful of mega-cap stocks raises questions about the sustainability of market valuations if AI monetization disappoints.</p>
<h3>6. Gold Surges Past $5,500 to Record High as Safe-Haven Demand and Central Bank Buying Intensify</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-21.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gold reached a new all-time high of $5,555 per ounce, marking a 100% gain over the last twelve months, as escalating geopolitical uncertainty, Federal Reserve independence concerns, and massive central bank purchases drive unprecedented safe-haven demand for the precious metal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spot gold increased to $5,501.18 per ounce, with February futures contracts exceeding $5,568 per unit. The rally reflects a fundamental repricing of gold as investors no longer view current prices as &quot;imminent crisis&quot; levels but rather as appropriate for &quot;a world of persistent instability, heavy debt burdens and eroding monetary trust,&quot; according to market strategists.</p>
<p>Global gold ETFs witnessed their strongest year of inflows on record in 2025, with annual inflows surging to $89 billion and global gold ETF assets doubling to $559 billion. Central bank purchases remained robust as nations diversify reserves away from dollar-denominated assets amid concerns about US fiscal sustainability and the weaponization of the dollar in geopolitical disputes.</p>
<p>A weakening US dollar has provided additional tailwind, making dollar-priced assets like gold more affordable for holders of other currencies. Additionally, a Trump administration criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has elevated safe-haven demand due to implications for central bank independence. Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale forecast gold reaching $6,000 per ounce by year-end as structural drivers remain intact.</p>
<h3>7. Emerging Markets Suffer Worst Week Since November as Global Risk Appetite Collapses</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-22.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emerging market stocks fell 1.4%—their steepest weekly drop since mid-December—as a global flight to safety drove investors out of developing-nation equities from record highs, with volatility spanning commodities and technology shares unsettling portfolio managers worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell as much as 1.5% on Friday before paring losses, while a similar measure tracking currencies showed mixed performance. Both gauges were poised for their steepest weekly drop since November, pulling a key index down from record highs reached in January as risk-off sentiment gripped global markets.</p>
<p>The selloff reflects multiple converging pressures: geopolitical tensions including US-Iran standoffs and the expiration of New START, uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy outlook, concerns about lofty technology valuations following massive AI capex announcements, and fears that tariff policies could disrupt global trade flows that many emerging economies depend upon.</p>
<p>Developing-nation central banks face a challenging environment as they balance domestic growth concerns against the need to defend currencies and control inflation. Countries with high dollar-denominated debt loads are particularly vulnerable if the risk-off sentiment persists, potentially forcing interest rate hikes that could trigger recessions in economies already struggling with weak external demand and capital outflow pressures.</p>
<h3>8. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings, Guides to $80-83 Billion Revenue on Weight Loss Drug Boom</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-23.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion or $7.39 per share, crushing Wall Street expectations, as blockbuster demand for weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro drives unprecedented revenue growth in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 drug category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pharmaceutical giant guided to 2026 revenue between $80-83 billion, dramatically exceeding analyst expectations of $77.62 billion, with adjusted earnings projected between $33.50-35 per share compared to consensus estimates of $33.23. The guidance implies continued market share gains against competitor Novo Nordisk, which has faced supply constraints limiting its ability to meet surging demand.</p>
<p>Production capacity investments are paying off, allowing Lilly to meet demand while Novo Nordisk struggles with shortages. The company&#39;s success reflects broader transformation in the pharmaceutical industry as GLP-1 drugs emerge as potentially the largest drug class in history, with applications expanding beyond obesity and diabetes into cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other conditions.</p>
<p>Clinical trials exploring new indications could expand the total addressable market well beyond current analyst models, potentially justifying Lilly&#39;s premium valuation despite shares trading at historically elevated price-to-earnings multiples. The company&#39;s execution in ramping production capacity faster than competitors has established a structural advantage that could persist for years as the global obesity epidemic drives sustained demand growth.</p>
<h3>9. Chipotle Stock Sinks 11% on Fourth Consecutive Quarter of Traffic Declines</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-24.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chipotle Mexican Grill shares fell as much as 11% in extended trading after reporting a fourth consecutive quarter of falling customer traffic and projecting flat same-store sales growth for 2026, signaling that the burrito chain&#39;s woes are not expected to disappear quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company posted adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share for Q4, slightly above the $0.24 consensus estimate, with revenue of $2.98 billion compared to expectations of $2.96 billion. However, traffic to Chipotle restaurants fell 3.2% and comparable restaurant sales declined 1.7%—the first annual same-store sales drop since 2016, alarming investors accustomed to consistent growth.</p>
<p>Executives noted pullback in spending from consumers of all income cohorts, although low-income diners have made the most significant shift in behavior. The 2026 outlook disappointed Wall Street as the company projected flat sales while analysts had forecast 1.8% growth, suggesting management sees limited near-term improvement in consumer spending patterns.</p>
<p>The traffic declines raise questions about whether Chipotle&#39;s premium pricing strategy has reached its limits, or whether broader economic pressures are forcing consumers to cut back on fast-casual dining. The company faces the dual challenge of maintaining value perception while protecting margins in an inflationary environment where ingredient costs, labor expenses, and occupancy charges continue to rise.</p>
<h3>10. Snowflake and OpenAI Announce $200 Million Partnership for Enterprise AI Integration</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-25.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowflake and OpenAI entered a multi-year, $200 million partnership that brings OpenAI frontier intelligence directly into Snowflake&#39;s data cloud, enabling the company&#39;s 12,600 enterprise customers to build AI applications and agents using their proprietary data without moving information outside Snowflake&#39;s governed environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the agreement, OpenAI models like GPT-5.2 will be available natively within Snowflake&#39;s AI Data Cloud across all three major cloud providers, allowing organizations to build custom applications and agents grounded in their enterprise data. Snowflake customers can use the models with tools like Snowflake Cortex AI to develop intelligent assistants, automated analytics, and AI-driven decision support tied directly to enterprise datasets.</p>
<p>The partnership is significant because it represents a direct, first-party integration of OpenAI&#39;s frontier models into Snowflake&#39;s platform rather than being mediated through a cloud provider like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud. This establishes deep technical integration that could provide performance and governance advantages over alternative architectures.</p>
<p>Analysts view the deal as strategic positioning in the enterprise AI race, where the battle is shifting from model development to production deployment at scale. Snowflake&#39;s emphasis on data governance and security—combined with OpenAI&#39;s leading language models—addresses enterprise concerns about deploying AI while maintaining control over proprietary information, intellectual property, and customer data.</p>
<h3>11. Producer Price Inflation Jumps 0.5% as Businesses Begin Passing Tariff Costs to Consumers</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-26.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Producer Price Index increased 0.5% in December—more than double the forecast of 0.2%—driven by a 0.7% surge in service prices, as businesses signal they are beginning to pass tariff costs down the supply chain after absorbing the majority of duties in 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Core goods PPI rose 0.4% in December, pointing to continued pass-through of tariffs into wholesale prices. JPMorgan estimates businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that proportion could flip to just 20% in 2026 as inventory stockpiles run out and price increases become unavoidable, setting the stage for renewed consumer inflation pressures.</p>
<p>The jump in wholesale prices fits into a wider trend of &quot;deglobalization inflation,&quot; where tariffs and supply chain domestication are raising the floor for prices across goods and services. With businesses passing more tariff costs to consumers, forecasters project US inflation rising to 2.7% in 2026 from current levels, complicating the Federal Reserve&#39;s efforts to return inflation to its 2% target.</p>
<p>Service sector price increases of 0.7%—the largest gain since July—suggest that inflation pressures are broadening beyond goods affected by tariffs. Wage growth, commercial real estate costs, and business services expenses are all contributing to wholesale price gains that will eventually flow through to consumer prices in industries from healthcare to hospitality.</p>
<h3>12. European Central Bank and Bank of England Hold Rates as Inflation Cools Below Targets</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-27.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank maintained its key policy rate at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting while the Bank of England held rates at 3.75% by a narrow 5-4 vote, as both institutions navigate slowing growth and below-target inflation amid uncertainty about economic trajectory and the impact of potential US tariffs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eurozone inflation cooled to 1.7% in January—below the ECB&#39;s 2% target—yet policymakers emphasized that inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant immediate rate cuts. Concerns about the euro&#39;s appreciation led some policymakers to monitor its potential disinflationary effects, while uncertainty about US trade policy creates additional complexity for monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p>Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the remainder of 2026, reflecting views that inflation will remain contained even as economic growth disappoints. The Bank of England&#39;s 5-4 vote reflects deeper divisions, with some members concerned about persistent services inflation while others worry about weak growth across major European economies.</p>
<p>The cautious approach from both central banks contrasts with expectations earlier in 2025 that aggressive rate cutting would be necessary to support growth. Resilient services inflation, tight labor markets, and uncertainty about fiscal policy in major economies have convinced policymakers to maintain restrictive policy despite below-target headline inflation and sluggish economic performance.</p>
<h3>13. Oil Prices Hold Near $63 as Iran Tensions Create Risk Premium Amid Oversupply Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-28.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude settled above $63 a barrel after a volatile week that saw prices whipsaw on US-Iran tensions, upcoming nuclear talks, and competing concerns about global oversupply as production surges from non-OPEC+ countries outpace demand growth projections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oil markets rallied earlier in the week on geopolitical risk premium following US military deployments to the Gulf and threats of strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but gave back gains as diplomatic talks scheduled in Muscat reduced immediate conflict probability. Iran&#39;s seizure of two oil tankers added modest upward pressure but failed to sustain momentum amid fundamental concerns about supply-demand balance.</p>
<p>OPEC+ extended production cuts through Q1 2026, attempting to support prices as surging output from Brazil, Argentina, Guyana, and US shale producers threatens to create oversupply conditions. Latin America&#39;s three emerging oil powers are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing Venezuela&#39;s recovery despite sanctions relief.</p>
<p>Energy analysts project crude prices will remain range-bound in the $60-70 range through mid-2026 barring major geopolitical shocks, with the balance between growing non-OPEC supply and uncertain global demand creating a cap on price appreciation. Chinese economic weakness, electric vehicle adoption acceleration, and efficiency gains in transportation continue to moderate long-term demand forecasts.</p>
<h3>14. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.11%, Lowest Level in Three Years, Spurring Housing Activity</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-29.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.11%—the lowest level since late 2022—driving a surge in purchase applications and refinance activity as the spring home-buying season approaches, with some lenders offering rates below 6% for well-qualified borrowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freddie Mac reported the 15-year fixed mortgage averaged 5.50%, while Morgan Stanley projects rates could decline to 5.75% later in 2026 if inflation continues moderating and the Federal Reserve signals openness to additional rate cuts. The decline creates opportunities for both first-time buyers entering the market and existing homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments.</p>
<p>Purchase and refinance applications have jumped year-over-year as lower rates improve affordability despite home prices remaining elevated in many markets. A surprising share of homeowners still carry mortgage rates above 5%, creating significant refinance demand as rates decline toward 6%. Housing industry experts note that activity &quot;is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season&quot; after two years of rate-driven headwinds.</p>
<p>However, affordability challenges persist in major metropolitan areas where inventory shortages and elevated prices offset the benefit of lower rates. The combination of pent-up buyer demand, falling rates, and limited housing stock could produce highly competitive spring markets with bidding wars returning in desirable locations, potentially preventing the price cooling that would make homeownership accessible to middle-income families.</p>
<h3>15. US Manufacturing Expands for First Time in 12 Months as New Orders and Production Surge</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-30.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ISM Manufacturing Index showed factory activity expanding in January for the first time in a year, with surges in new orders and production signaling potential economic resilience and ending the longest manufacturing contraction streak since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expansion reflects improved business confidence, easing supply chain pressures, and stabilizing demand conditions after months of inventory reduction and cautious ordering patterns. Transport stocks hit new all-time highs with the Dow Jones Transportation Average rising 2%, led by United Airlines, Old Dominion, and Delta Air Lines as investors positioned for strengthening economic activity.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs projects the US will substantially outperform global growth forecasts—estimating 2.6% GDP growth versus 2.0% consensus—due to reduced tariff drag, potential tax cuts, and easier financial conditions. The manufacturing rebound reinforces the bullish thesis that the economy can achieve a soft landing despite 18 months of restrictive Federal Reserve policy.</p>
<p>However, the sustainability of the manufacturing recovery remains uncertain given ongoing tariff threats, elevated interest rates relative to historical norms, and slowing global demand from major trading partners. Energy led January sector performance at 14.37%, followed by materials and consumer staples, while health care, information technology, and financials declined as investors rotated toward defensive positioning amid geopolitical turbulence.</p>

<h2>Fusion Energy</h2>
<h3>1. Canada&#39;s General Fusion Sets World Record with 600 Million Neutrons Per Second - <em>Jan 15</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Magnetized target fusion breakthrough produces highest neutron output ever recorded, demonstrating viable commercial pathway to fusion energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Canadian company General Fusion achieved a historic milestone in January 2026 by producing approximately 600 million fusion neutrons per second at peak output, marking the highest neutron yield ever recorded for magnetized target fusion (MTF). The results, published in the journal Nuclear Fusion and independently verified by external scientists, represent a major validation of MTF as a viable pathway to commercial fusion energy alongside tokamaks and inertial confinement approaches.</p>
<p>The achievement came from General Fusion&#39;s long-running Plasma Compression Science experiment series at its facility in Burnaby, British Columbia. In fusion research, neutron output serves as the primary indicator of successful fusion reactions, since neutrons carry most of the reaction energy. By demonstrating sustained high neutron yields, General Fusion has proven that its approach can achieve the plasma conditions necessary for net energy production. During compression, plasma density rose to approximately 190 times the starting value while the confining magnetic field strengthened by more than 13 times—all while maintaining plasma stability instead of the violent instabilities that typically plague fusion experiments.</p>
<p>General Fusion&#39;s approach differs fundamentally from conventional tokamaks by using mechanical pistons to rapidly compress a spinning plasma vortex inside a liquid metal liner. This eliminates the need for expensive superconducting magnets and dramatically simplifies the reactor design. Mike Donaldson, Senior Vice President for Technology Development at General Fusion, stated the team has &quot;demonstrated the viability of a stable fusion process&quot; that will inform their LM26 demonstration project. The company projects achieving transformative milestones within 24 months and bringing commercial fusion power to the grid by the early to mid-2030s, potentially ahead of larger tokamak projects like ITER.</p>
<h3>2. China&#39;s EAST Tokamak Breaks Through Plasma Density Barrier - <em>Jan 1</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists achieve stable plasma operation beyond the Greenwald density limit, unlocking a critical path toward sustained fusion ignition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China&#39;s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) successfully demonstrated stable plasma confinement at densities 1.6 times higher than the theoretical Greenwald limit—a ceiling that has constrained tokamak performance for decades. The breakthrough, published in Science Advances on January 1, 2026, represents one of the most significant advances in fusion physics in recent years and could reshape how future reactors are designed.</p>
<p>For decades, pushing plasma density beyond the Greenwald limit typically triggered violent disruptions that damage reactor walls and terminate fusion reactions. EAST researchers discovered that by carefully controlling plasma-wall interactions during startup—specifically by optimizing fuel gas pressure and applying electron cyclotron resonance heating—they could minimize impurity buildup and energy losses. This allows the plasma to enter what theorists call a &quot;density-free regime,&quot; where the usual ceiling no longer applies.</p>
<p>The implications extend far beyond EAST itself. ITER, SPARC, and other next-generation reactors aim to achieve sustained fusion ignition, which requires maintaining extremely high plasma densities. If this approach can be replicated across different reactor designs, it could accelerate timelines for commercial fusion power by allowing reactors to operate closer to optimal conditions without fear of catastrophic instabilities. Researchers at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and other institutions are now working to validate these findings on spherical tokamaks and conventional designs.</p>
<h3>3. France&#39;s WEST Tokamak Achieves Six-Minute Tungsten Plasma Record - <em>Jan 20</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Upgraded tungsten-walled reactor sustains plasma at 50 million degrees Celsius, demonstrating materials crucial for commercial fusion plants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>France&#39;s WEST (Tungsten Environment in Steady-State Tokamak) reactor achieved a landmark milestone in January 2026 by sustaining plasma at 50 million degrees Celsius for six continuous minutes—the longest duration ever achieved with all-tungsten plasma-facing components. The achievement, following a major upgrade from carbon to tungsten interior walls, demonstrates that tungsten can withstand the extreme conditions inside fusion reactors while maintaining plasma stability over operationally relevant timescales.</p>
<p>Tungsten represents the material of choice for next-generation fusion reactors because of its exceptional heat resistance and high melting point (3,422°C), making it far superior to the carbon tiles used in earlier tokamaks. However, tungsten presents significant engineering challenges: even microscopic amounts of tungsten contamination can rapidly cool the plasma and quench fusion reactions. WEST researchers overcame this problem by developing advanced plasma control techniques that minimize plasma-wall contact while efficiently exhausting heat and impurities through the divertor—the exhaust system that handles particles leaving the plasma.</p>
<p>The six-minute duration represents a critical threshold for commercial fusion reactors, which must operate continuously for hours or days to be economically viable. WEST&#39;s success validates the all-tungsten design planned for ITER and provides crucial operational data for optimizing plasma scenarios. The achievement is part of a broader international collaboration involving over 200 researchers from 40 institutions worldwide, with WEST serving as a testing ground for ITER technologies. Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and other fusion research centers are now adapting WEST&#39;s plasma control strategies for their own tungsten tokamak experiments.</p>
<h3>4. South Korea&#39;s KSTAR Installs Advanced Tungsten Divertor for 300-Second Target - <em>Jan 10</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Next-generation divertor upgrade positions KSTAR to achieve five-minute plasma duration by end of 2026, advancing commercial fusion timeline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>South Korea&#39;s KSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research) tokamak completed installation of an advanced tungsten divertor in early January 2026, enabling the facility to pursue sustained plasma operation exceeding 300 seconds—five full minutes—by the end of the year. The upgrade replaces KSTAR&#39;s previous carbon divertor with tungsten components capable of withstanding heat fluxes up to 10 megawatts per square meter, matching the thermal loads expected in commercial fusion power plants.</p>
<p>KSTAR has progressively extended its high-performance plasma duration over recent campaigns, sustaining ion temperatures of approximately 100 million degrees Celsius for 48 seconds and maintaining high-confinement mode for 102 seconds in recent experiments. The tungsten divertor installation removes the primary limitation preventing longer pulses: carbon components degraded too quickly under sustained high heat flux, contaminating the plasma and forcing premature shutdown. Tungsten&#39;s superior thermal properties and resistance to erosion enable KSTAR to pursue the multi-minute operations required to study steady-state fusion burn physics.</p>
<p>Achieving 300 seconds of sustained high-temperature plasma would represent a critical milestone for magnetic confinement fusion, demonstrating that tokamaks can maintain fusion conditions over timescales relevant to commercial power generation. KSTAR&#39;s results will directly inform the design and operation of Commonwealth Fusion Systems&#39; SPARC reactor and other private fusion ventures targeting commercial operation in the early 2030s. The facility&#39;s research focuses on understanding and controlling edge-localized modes (ELMs)—explosive plasma instabilities that erode reactor walls—through advanced magnetic field shaping and real-time feedback control systems developed through international collaboration with ITER and other fusion programs.</p>
<h3>5. MIT and Commonwealth Fusion Systems Announce Five-Year SPARC Collaboration - <em>Jan 6</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Expanded research partnership positions MIT as key contributor to world&#39;s first net-energy fusion demonstration expected in 2027.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MIT&#39;s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) and Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) announced a five-year expansion of their collaboration in early January 2026, deepening MIT&#39;s involvement in SPARC—the demonstration tokamak that CFS expects will achieve net fusion energy in 2027. The agreement formalizes MIT&#39;s role in cutting-edge fusion research and education while CFS focuses on engineering and commercializing fusion technology, exemplifying the productive partnership between academic research institutions and private fusion companies.</p>
<p>Under the expanded agreement, MIT researchers will contribute to SPARC&#39;s physics optimization, diagnostic development, and plasma control systems while conducting fundamental research into high-temperature superconducting magnet technology and advanced materials for fusion applications. PSFC Director Dennis Whyte emphasized that &quot;CFS will build SPARC and develop a commercial fusion product, while MIT PSFC will focus on its core mission of cutting-edge research and education,&quot; ensuring both institutions leverage their respective strengths. The partnership enables MIT graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to access SPARC&#39;s unprecedented plasma conditions once the facility begins operations.</p>
<p>SPARC is currently under construction at CFS headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts, with the first of 18 massive toroidal field magnets recently installed on the assembly jig. The compact tokamak utilizes high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets capable of generating magnetic fields exceeding 20 Tesla—the strongest fusion magnets in the world. This enables SPARC to achieve fusion conditions in a device with only 1/65th the volume of ITER while targeting a fusion gain (Q) of approximately 11, meaning it will produce roughly 11 times more fusion energy than the energy required to heat the plasma. If successful, SPARC will validate the physics and engineering for ARC, CFS&#39;s planned 400-megawatt commercial fusion power plant targeted for the early 2030s.</p>

<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Landmark research published in Science challenges conventional estimates, finding longevity is far more heritable than previously believed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A groundbreaking study published in Science on January 29, 2026, revealed that genetic factors account for approximately 50-55% of human lifespan variation—dramatically higher than the 10-25% estimates that have dominated longevity research for decades. The research, which analyzed data from twin cohorts using advanced mathematical modeling, demonstrates that previous estimates were confounded by extrinsic mortality factors such as accidents, infections, and environmental hazards that mask the true genetic contribution to aging.</p>
<p>The research team distinguished between extrinsic mortality (deaths from external causes) and intrinsic mortality (deaths from internal biological aging processes). By isolating intrinsic mortality and controlling for shared environmental factors in twin studies, the researchers found that heritable genetic variants exert far greater influence on how long individuals live than previously recognized. Importantly, the study emphasizes that heritability is not a fixed property—it applies to specific populations in specific environments at specific times, meaning the genetic contribution to lifespan may vary across different societies and historical periods.</p>
<p>The findings have profound implications for longevity research and drug development. If more than half of lifespan variation is genetically determined, substantial returns can be expected from large-scale efforts to identify longevity-associated genetic variants, refine polygenic risk scores, and link specific genetic differences to biological pathways that regulate aging. Pharmaceutical companies are now prioritizing the discovery of drugs that mimic the protective effects seen in individuals who naturally live to 100 or beyond. The research strengthens the scientific rationale for investigating interventions targeting fundamental aging mechanisms rather than treating age-related diseases individually, potentially transforming how medicine approaches human healthspan and lifespan.</p>
<h3>2. Scientists Map Human Genome in Unprecedented 4D Detail Revealing Hidden DNA Architecture - <em>Jan 7</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature study provides revolutionary insights into how DNA folds, loops, and repositions across time and cell types, unlocking disease mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An international research collaboration published in Nature on January 7, 2026, unveiled the most detailed maps to date of the human genome&#39;s three-dimensional organization across time and space—effectively creating a &quot;4D blueprint&quot; of how DNA operates inside living cells. The study identified over 140,000 DNA looping interactions in human embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts, revealing how genes physically interact with regulatory elements located millions of base pairs away and how these interactions change as cells function and divide.</p>
<p>DNA doesn&#39;t remain static inside cells—it constantly folds, loops, and rearranges in patterns that fundamentally shape how genes behave. The research team used advanced chromosome conformation capture techniques combined with computational modeling to map these dynamic structures at unprecedented resolution. Critically, they developed AI-powered tools that can predict how a genome will fold based solely on its DNA sequence, enabling researchers to estimate how genetic variants—including disease-linked mutations—might alter 3D genome structure without conducting expensive laboratory experiments.</p>
<p>The findings explain a longstanding mystery in genomics: why many disease-associated genetic variants fall outside of protein-coding genes yet still cause significant harm. The answer lies in three-dimensional genome architecture—these variants disrupt DNA loops that connect genes with distant regulatory elements, changing when and where genes are expressed. The research consortium demonstrated that computational predictions of genome folding can identify previously unknown disease mechanisms and suggest novel therapeutic strategies. Pharmaceutical companies are now exploring ways to target specific DNA loops or develop drugs that restore normal genome architecture in diseases caused by structural genome disruptions. The 4D genome maps will accelerate precision medicine by enabling clinicians to interpret the functional consequences of genetic variants discovered in patient sequencing.</p>
<h3>3. Genetic Study Reveals Four-Fold Variation in DNA Repeat Expansion Rates with Age - <em>Jan 9</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysis of 900,000 individuals identifies genetic variants controlling DNA instability, linking expansions to kidney and liver disease risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A comprehensive genetic study published in Nature in early January 2026 analyzed data from over 900,000 people and discovered that certain DNA sequences—composed of short sequences repeated many times—become progressively longer and more unstable with age. Crucially, the study identified 29 genetic locations where inherited variants modify the rate of repeat expansion by up to four-fold, explaining why some individuals experience rapid DNA instability while others remain relatively stable throughout life.</p>
<p>DNA repeat expansions cause devastating neurological diseases including Huntington&#39;s disease, myotonic dystrophy, and multiple forms of ataxia. The new research expanded understanding of repeat instability far beyond these rare conditions, demonstrating that common genetic variants influence expansion rates across the genome. Paradoxically, the same DNA repair genes had opposite effects on different repeats: variants that stabilized some sequences actually destabilized others, revealing unexpected complexity in how cells maintain genome stability during aging.</p>
<p>The study identified a newly recognized repeat expansion disorder linked to the GLS gene, which occurs in approximately 0.03% of the population. Individuals carrying this expansion face 14-fold higher risk of severe kidney disease and 3-fold higher risk of liver disease—conditions not previously associated with repeat expansion disorders. This discovery suggests many common diseases may have unrecognized genetic repeat expansion components. The research establishes blood-based DNA repeat measurements as potential biomarkers for testing future therapies aimed at slowing repeat expansion in diseases like Huntington&#39;s, where expansion rate correlates with symptom onset and severity. Multiple biotechnology companies are now developing small molecule therapies and antisense oligonucleotides designed to stabilize DNA repeats, with clinical trials expected to begin in 2026.</p>
<h3>4. Rare Genetic Variant in MSI2 Gene Provides 30% Protection Against Blood Cancer - <em>Jan 1</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Science study identifies inherited DNA change that reduces clonal hematopoiesis and myeloid disease risk, offering therapeutic target for prevention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers reported in Science on January 1, 2026, the discovery of a rare genetic variant that provides substantial protection against the development of clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) and myeloid blood cancers. The variant, designated rs17834140-T, weakens the activity of the MSI2 gene encoding musashi RNA binding protein 2, a key regulator of blood stem cell maintenance. Individuals with one copy of the protective variant show 16% reduced risk of developing CHIP and 20% protection against myeloid diseases, while those with two copies enjoy 30% reduced CHIP risk.</p>
<p>CHIP occurs when a single mutated blood stem cell outcompetes its neighbors, gradually taking over blood production. While CHIP itself is not cancer, it substantially increases risk of developing leukemia and other blood cancers, and is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. The rs17834140-T variant disrupts a binding site for the transcription factor GATA-2, reducing MSI2 expression in hematopoietic stem cells and suppressing an entire network of genes that mutant stem cells rely on for competitive advantage. This effectively creates a less favorable environment for clonal expansion.</p>
<p>About 4% of people worldwide carry at least one copy of the protective variant, though prevalence varies dramatically across populations—highest in individuals of Finnish ancestry and lowest in Amish, Middle Eastern, and East Asian populations. The findings were derived from genetic analyses involving hundreds of thousands of participants across multiple biobanks. Researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center who led the study suggest that drugs inhibiting MSI2 activity could potentially prevent blood cancer development in high-risk individuals, such as those with existing CHIP or family histories of leukemia. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have initiated programs to develop MSI2 inhibitors for blood cancer prevention, representing a paradigm shift from treating established cancers toward intercepting them before malignancy develops.</p>
<h3>5. CRISPR Base Editor Safely Activates Fetal Hemoglobin Gene Without DNA Cutting - <em>Jan 4</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>UNSW Sydney researchers develop gentler gene therapy approach for sickle cell disease by removing chemical modifications rather than editing DNA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists at UNSW Sydney developed a novel CRISPR technique published on January 4, 2026, that reactivates silenced genes by removing chemical modifications without cutting DNA—potentially offering a safer approach to treating genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia. The technique, which resolves a decades-long debate about gene silencing mechanisms, uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups acting as molecular anchors that keep genes switched off.</p>
<p>Traditional CRISPR-Cas9 works by cutting both strands of DNA to disable or repair genes, but this approach carries risks of unintended chromosomal rearrangements and off-target mutations. The new base-editing approach is fundamentally different: rather than breaking DNA, it chemically erases the epigenetic marks that silence genes. The UNSW team demonstrated this approach by reactivating the fetal globin gene, which naturally produces hemoglobin before birth but becomes silenced in adults. Reactivating fetal globin offers a potential cure for sickle cell disease by compensating for defective adult hemoglobin.</p>
<p>The technique addresses a key safety concern that has limited clinical adoption of gene editing therapies. By avoiding DNA breaks, the risk of cancer-causing mutations or chromosomal instability is dramatically reduced. Current sickle cell gene therapies use CRISPR to permanently disable the BCL11A gene, which suppresses fetal globin production, but this approach requires complete disruption of a gene with other important functions. The epigenetic editing approach offers more precise control—turning genes on or off by degrees rather than permanently destroying them. Multiple biotechnology companies are now adapting the technology for clinical development, with applications extending beyond sickle cell disease to other conditions caused by abnormal gene silencing, including certain cancers, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases.</p>

<h2>AI Advancements</h2>
<h3>1. OpenAI&#39;s o3 Model Achieves Breakthrough on ARC-AGI Benchmark Through Test-Time Compute - <em>Jan 16</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Reasoning-focused model demonstrates that scaling inference compute unlocks adaptive intelligence comparable to human problem-solving flexibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI&#39;s o3 model achieved a breakthrough on the ARC-AGI benchmark in mid-January 2026, demonstrating a fundamental shift in AI capabilities from pattern-matching to genuine adaptive reasoning. Unlike previous models trained primarily through massive pre-training datasets, o3 achieved its results by &quot;thinking longer&quot; during inference—using extended test-time compute to explore multiple solution paths, identify flaws in its reasoning, and iteratively refine its approach before producing answers.</p>
<p>François Chollet, the Google researcher who created ARC-AGI specifically to test for general intelligence rather than memorization, called o3&#39;s performance &quot;a genuine breakthrough in adaptability.&quot; The benchmark requires models to solve novel visual reasoning puzzles they&#39;ve never encountered during training, testing the ability to form abstractions and apply them to unfamiliar situations—capabilities that define human-like intelligence. Previous state-of-the-art models scored below 50% on ARC-AGI, while o3 achieved scores approaching human performance by dedicating significantly more computational resources to deliberation during inference.</p>
<p>The achievement represents vindication of the &quot;test-time compute scaling&quot; hypothesis: that giving models more time and resources to &quot;think&quot; during inference can unlock qualitatively new capabilities that pre-training alone cannot achieve. This finding triggered a paradigm shift across the AI industry, with Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta, and Chinese labs racing to develop competing reasoning models. By late January 2026, multiple labs had released models with extended reasoning capabilities, fundamentally changing how AI systems approach complex problems. The shift from &quot;fast, reflexive&quot; to &quot;slow, deliberative&quot; AI mirrors the dual-process theory of human cognition, suggesting AI may be converging toward cognitive architectures with human-like flexibility and depth.</p>
<h3>2. AI Companions Reach 72% Teen Adoption as Safety Concerns Mount Following Suicide Links - <em>Feb 7</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Chatbot emotional support use surges among adolescents while regulators and safety groups demand guardrails after multiple deaths linked to AI interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AI companion chatbots have become mainstream among teenagers, with 72% of adolescents now using AI for friendship and emotional support according to surveys released in early February 2026. Platforms including Replika, Character.AI, Snapchat&#39;s My AI, and others have created customizable AI personalities offering voice interaction, memory of past conversations, and integration into smart devices—transforming AI from utilitarian assistant to emotionally responsive companion. The rapid adoption reflects teens&#39; growing comfort with AI relationships, but has triggered urgent safety concerns following multiple suicides linked to chatbot interactions.</p>
<p>Adolescents describe AI companions as easier to talk to than people because they respond instantly, remain consistently calm and affirming, and are available 24/7 during emotional crises. However, this accessibility has become controversial after cases emerged of vulnerable young people sharing suicidal thoughts with chatbots instead of trusted adults or mental health professionals. Families of deceased teens have alleged that AI responses failed to discourage self-harm and in some cases appeared to validate dangerous thinking. Critics point out that chatbots are deliberately programmed to be affirming and agreeable to encourage user attachment—creating business incentives that may conflict with user wellbeing.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association issued a health advisory in February 2026 specifically addressing AI companions and adolescent mental health, calling on AI companies to implement robust safety mechanisms including automatic escalation to crisis resources when users express suicidal ideation. Child safety organizations argue that AI companions &quot;can only perform empathy&quot; and lack the genuine human understanding required to navigate complex emotional situations. Several jurisdictions are considering age restrictions or mandatory safety features for AI companion platforms. The controversy highlights a broader tension in AI development: while these tools can provide valuable support and reduce loneliness, deploying them without adequate safeguards for vulnerable populations creates significant risks. Multiple AI companion platforms announced enhanced safety features in response to the growing criticism, but regulatory frameworks remain fragmented.</p>
<h3>3. AI-Generated Code Reaches 30% of New Code at Microsoft and Google - <em>Jan 25</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Generative AI coding assistants fundamentally transform software development as major tech companies report AI writing nearly one-third of new code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft and Google executives revealed in late January 2026 that AI systems now generate approximately 30% of all new code written at both companies—up from 25% just three months earlier and representing a dramatic acceleration in AI-assisted software development. Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated the company is using AI to write &quot;well over 30%&quot; of new code, while Microsoft confirmed similar adoption rates across its engineering teams. The milestone marks AI&#39;s transition from experimental development tool to core infrastructure for software engineering at the world&#39;s largest technology companies.</p>
<p>The surge in AI code generation reflects rapid improvements in specialized coding models including GitHub Copilot, Google&#39;s Gemini Code Assist, and newer &quot;repository intelligence&quot; systems that understand not just individual code snippets but the relationships, dependencies, and history across entire codebases. These systems can now generate entire functions or modules based on natural language descriptions, suggest refactorings that improve code quality, automatically write unit tests, and even identify security vulnerabilities during development. The technology has progressed from autocomplete for single lines to systems capable of implementing complete features spanning multiple files.</p>
<p>The transformation is giving rise to &quot;vibe coding&quot;—an emerging development paradigm where programmers describe desired functionality in natural language and AI generates, refines, and debugs the implementation. While some developers embrace AI as productivity-enhancing, others express concern that over-reliance on generated code may erode deep understanding of software architecture and introduce subtle bugs that human review may miss. The shift is also raising questions about code ownership, liability for AI-generated bugs, and whether AI coding assistants will eventually replace junior developers or simply elevate the entire profession to work at higher levels of abstraction. Software engineering curricula are rapidly adapting to teach students how to effectively collaborate with AI coding tools, recognizing that AI-assisted development is becoming the industry standard rather than optional enhancement.</p>
<h3>4. Multimodal AI Video Understanding Achieves Real-Time Generation with Molmo 2 - <em>Dec 20, 2025</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>State-of-the-art open model enables precise spatial-temporal reasoning while real-time video generation approaches sub-second latency for commercial applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Allen Institute for AI released Molmo 2 in late December 2025, a breakthrough multimodal AI model achieving state-of-the-art video understanding through precise spatial-temporal reasoning, object tracking across frames, and multi-frame analysis. The 8-billion-parameter model surpasses its 72-billion-parameter predecessor in accuracy while introducing fundamental advances in how AI processes video: treating time as a physical dimension through spatial-temporal tokenization rather than sampling individual frames. This architectural shift enables AI to understand motion, causality, and temporal relationships that were previously inaccessible to video AI systems.</p>
<p>Molmo 2&#39;s capabilities extend beyond passive video analysis to active pointing, object tracking, and answering complex questions that require reasoning across multiple frames and modalities. The model outperforms proprietary competitors including Gemini 3 on video tracking tasks despite being fully open-source and significantly smaller. This efficiency breakthrough came from training approaches that better leverage the structure of visual data, enabling more capable models to run on less expensive hardware—democratizing access to advanced video AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Parallel advances in video generation are enabling real-time synthesis, with industry analysts projecting sub-second video generation will become standard in 2026. The integration of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) with native multimodality is producing digital avatars approaching photorealism, while true audiovisual synthesis—where AI understands scenes and generates perfectly matched sound—is emerging as a commercial capability. Research institutions including Hong Kong Polytechnic University have developed systems like VideoMind that enable long-form video reasoning and question-answering across feature-length content. These capabilities are being rapidly commercialized for applications including content moderation, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging, where understanding dynamic visual information is critical. The convergence of real-time video understanding and generation is creating new categories of applications from interactive virtual beings to AI cinematographers that can direct and edit video content autonomously.</p>
<h3>5. AI Drug Discovery Achieves Record Investigational New Drug Filings in 2025 - <em>Jan 15</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine learning platforms deliver highest single-year jump in clinical trial applications for AI-originated molecules, signaling pharmaceutical transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry achieved a milestone in 2025 with the highest single-year increase in Investigational New Drug (IND) filings for molecules designed using artificial intelligence platforms. Companies including Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, BenevolentAI, Absci, and Generate Biomedicines collectively filed more than a dozen INDs for AI-originated small molecules and biologics, concentrated in oncology, fibrosis, autoimmune disorders, and rare diseases. The surge validates AI&#39;s graduation from experimental research tool to platform-scale engine driving pharmaceutical innovation.</p>
<p>The progress builds on transformative advances in protein structure prediction, particularly AlphaFold3 and open-source alternatives like OpenFold3, which now accurately predict three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes, antibody-antigen interactions, and protein-DNA/RNA binding. These capabilities give medicinal chemists unprecedented insight into how candidate drugs interact with biological targets, dramatically accelerating lead optimization. Boltz-2, an open-source model from MIT and Recursion, delivers near physics-level accuracy for binding affinity predictions at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than traditional molecular dynamics simulations—enabling researchers to computationally screen millions of candidates before synthesizing any.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies are integrating AI throughout drug development pipelines through collaborative initiatives like the AI Structural Biology Network, where major pharmaceutical companies fine-tune foundation models using proprietary structural data via federated learning—benefiting from shared knowledge without exposing confidential intellectual property. Early clinical results are encouraging: Insilico Medicine&#39;s INS018_055, an AI-designed drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, demonstrated favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in Phase IIa trials announced in January 2026. Iktos entered a €1+ billion multi-target AI partnership with Servier for oncology and neurology drug discovery. As these AI-originated molecules progress through Phase II and Phase III trials, the industry awaits proof that AI&#39;s promise translates into approved therapies reaching patients—a validation that would trigger even more aggressive AI investment across pharmaceutical research.</p>

<h2>Inflation &amp; Finance Metrics</h2>
<h3>1. January Layoffs Hit 108,435, Highest Start to Year Since 2009 Recession - <em>Feb 5</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, a 118% surge from a year earlier, with tech and finance sectors bearing the brunt as companies redirect spending toward AI infrastructure while trimming costs elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, marking a 118% increase from the fewer than 50,000 announced a year ago and representing the worst start to a year for layoffs since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Amazon&#39;s 16,000 layoffs contributed heavily to the tech industry losing 22,291 jobs in January, extending a multi-year wave of workforce reductions into 2026 as firms redirect budgets toward artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and data centers while trimming costs in legacy operations.</p>
<p>Global technology companies and startups cut nearly 25,000 jobs in January alone, with major announcements including Meta&#39;s 1,500 job cuts representing about 10% of its Reality Labs division, software companies Autodesk and Pinterest each eliminating close to 1,000 roles, and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson announcing 1,600 role eliminations in Sweden as part of cost-saving measures. The layoff surge reflects a fundamental shift in capital allocation, with artificial intelligence cited for 7,624 cuts in January, though much of the downsizing represents budget redirections toward AI models, graphics processing units, cloud infrastructure, and large-scale data centers.</p>
<p>The January layoff figures mark a stark reversal from the tight labor market of 2021-2022 and signal mounting economic uncertainty despite relatively low unemployment rates. Some layoffs are scheduled through February 23, 2026, with affected employees receiving at least 90 days of pay, benefits, and job transition assistance. The concentration of layoffs in high-wage tech and finance sectors creates a paradox where aggregate employment figures remain stable while knowledge workers face unprecedented job insecurity, complicating the Federal Reserve&#39;s assessment of labor market health as it navigates monetary policy decisions in 2026.</p>
<h3>2. S&amp;P 500 Net Profit Margins Hit 13.2%, Highest Level Since 2009 Despite Recession Fears - <em>Feb 6</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The blended net profit margin for S&amp;P 500 companies reached 13.2% in Q4 2025, the highest since FactSet began tracking the metric in 2009, with 76% of companies beating earnings estimates by an aggregate 7.6%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>S&amp;P 500 companies reported the highest net profit margin in over 15 years during Q4 2025, with the blended net profit margin reaching 13.2%, surpassing all previous quarters since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2009. The robust profitability comes despite persistent recession warnings and economic uncertainty, with corporations demonstrating pricing power and operational efficiency that has allowed them to maintain and expand margins even as revenue growth has moderated from pandemic-era peaks.</p>
<p>At the sector level, four sectors reported year-over-year increases in net profit margins compared to Q4 2024, led by Information Technology (29.0% vs. 26.8%) and Industrials (12.5% vs. 10.7%), reflecting continued strength in software, semiconductors, and capital equipment. However, six sectors reported year-over-year decreases, led by Real Estate (33.5% vs. 35.1%), suggesting divergence between technology-driven growth sectors and interest-rate-sensitive industries. The blended year-over-year earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 reached 13.0%, with 76% of companies reporting actual EPS above analyst estimates, beating consensus by an aggregate 7.6%.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, estimated net profit margins for Q1 2026 through Q4 2026 are projected at 13.2%, 13.8%, 14.2%, and 14.2% respectively, suggesting analysts expect margin expansion to continue through the year. The sustained profitability amid economic uncertainty highlights corporations&#39; ability to pass costs to consumers, reduce operating expenses, and leverage technology to enhance productivity. However, the margin strength also raises questions about sustainability, as persistently high corporate profits could draw political scrutiny and regulatory pressure, particularly if consumer affordability continues to deteriorate.</p>
<h3>3. Federal Reserve Ends Quantitative Tightening as Balance Sheet Stabilizes at $6.6 Trillion - <em>Dec 1, 2025</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve officially ended quantitative tightening on December 1, 2025, after reducing its securities holdings by $2.2 trillion since June 2022, with the balance sheet stabilizing at $6.6 trillion or 21% of GDP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve concluded its quantitative tightening program on December 1, 2025, marking the end of a three-and-a-half-year effort to normalize its balance sheet following the massive pandemic-era expansion. Since balance sheet reduction began in June 2022, the Federal Reserve&#39;s total securities holdings declined by more than $2.2 trillion, with redemptions of approximately $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities and $600 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2025, the Fed&#39;s assets stood at $6.6 trillion, representing about 21% of GDP, down from the March 2022 peak of nearly $9 trillion but still dramatically above pre-pandemic levels of $800 billion or 6% of GDP in December 2005.</p>
<p>The FOMC directed the Desk to roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve&#39;s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve&#39;s holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills, signaling a shift from active balance sheet reduction to maintenance mode. The Fed will likely use reserve management purchases (RMPs) in the coming months to help maintain liquidity without affecting longer-term borrowing costs, which is a goal reserved for quantitative easing (QE). This approach allows the Fed to provide short-term liquidity support while avoiding the market distortions and inflation risks associated with large-scale asset purchases.</p>
<p>The end of quantitative tightening comes amid persistent inflation above the Fed&#39;s 2% target and ongoing debate about the appropriate size of the central bank&#39;s balance sheet. Some economists argue that the Fed should continue reducing its holdings to pre-pandemic levels to avoid market dependency on central bank support, while others contend that the larger balance sheet is necessary to ensure adequate financial system liquidity given the growth of the economy and financial markets since 2008. The FOMC&#39;s decision to halt QT while maintaining elevated holdings suggests a pragmatic middle ground, preserving optionality to resume asset purchases if economic conditions deteriorate while avoiding the risks of overly aggressive balance sheet reduction.</p>
<h3>4. JPMorgan Chase Reports Record $185.6 Billion Annual Revenue Despite Q4 Reserve Charge - <em>Jan 13</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>JPMorgan Chase beat Q4 2025 earnings expectations with $5.23 per share versus $5.00 consensus, posting full-year managed revenue of $185.6 billion and net income of $57.0 billion despite a $2.2 billion Apple Card reserve charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JPMorgan Chase reported record annual financial performance for 2025, with managed revenue reaching $185.6 billion, net income of $57.0 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $20.02, despite taking a preannounced $2.2 billion reserve tied to its takeover of the Apple Card loan portfolio from Goldman Sachs. The bank&#39;s Q4 2025 results topped analyst expectations, with adjusted earnings of $5.23 per share versus $5.00 consensus estimate, and revenue of $46.77 billion versus $46.201 billion expected, driven by better-than-expected trading operations revenue.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Payments saw $5.1 billion in revenue in Q4 2025, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting the bank&#39;s dominance in corporate treasury services and merchant processing. Profit fell 7% to $13.03 billion, or $4.63 per share in Q4, primarily due to the Apple Card reserve charge, which the bank characterized as a one-time impact that should not affect future quarters. The bank&#39;s trading division delivered particularly strong results, benefiting from elevated market volatility and robust client activity in fixed income, currencies, and commodities.</p>
<p>Analysts expect U.S. bank earnings to rise by high single digits year-over-year in 2025, with JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs each reporting record or near-record annual hauls in trading fees. Bank of America reported Q4 earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $0.96, representing a potential 17% jump from the same period last year. Falling interest rates, rising Wall Street trading and advisory fees, stable consumer credit, and regulatory deregulation have all supported bank profitability, positioning the sector for continued growth in 2026 despite concerns about commercial real estate exposure and potential recession risks.</p>
<h3>5. Real Wages Rose 0.9% in 2025 as Nominal Wage Growth Outpaced Inflation for 11th Straight Month - <em>Dec 10, 2025</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Between December 2024 and December 2025, nominal wages grew 3.8% to $1,266 per week while inflation stood at 2.7%, resulting in real wage growth of 0.92% or $12 per week in inflation-adjusted purchasing power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>American workers experienced meaningful real wage growth in 2025, with inflation-adjusted earnings increasing 0.9% as nominal wage growth of 3.8% outpaced inflation of 2.7% for the full year. Between December 2024 and December 2025, the nominal average wage grew from $1,221 to $1,266—$45 more per week—with accounting for inflation yielding real wage growth of 0.92% or an additional $12 per week in purchasing power. Wage growth exceeded inflation in every month from February 2024 through December 2025, marking the longest sustained period of real wage gains since the pre-pandemic economy.</p>
<p>From December 2024 to December 2025, real average hourly earnings increased 0.9%, seasonally adjusted, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The change in real average hourly earnings combined with no change in the average workweek resulted in a 1.0% increase in real average weekly earnings over this period. The Atlanta Fed&#39;s Wage Growth Tracker, which measures the median wage growth of individuals, showed similar trends, with wage growth concentrated among job switchers, who typically command higher compensation in tight labor markets than workers who remain with the same employer.</p>
<p>However, the real wage gains of 2025 only partially offset the purchasing power losses of 2021-2023, when inflation surged to multi-decade highs and real wages declined sharply. Cumulatively, workers still face higher costs for essentials like housing, food, and healthcare compared to pre-pandemic levels, even accounting for nominal wage increases. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release Real Earnings for January 2026 on February 11, providing the first data point for whether real wage growth continued into the new year or whether tariff-driven inflation has begun eroding workers&#39; purchasing power.</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Developments</h2>
<h3>1. Bitcoin Mining Costs Reach $87,000 as Network Hashrate Rebounds to 913 EH/s - <em>Feb 5</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin trades near $70,000, roughly 20% below the estimated average production cost of $87,000, as the network hashrate rebounds to 913 EH/s and energy consumption surges to 854,400 kWh per Bitcoin, exceeding Belgium&#39;s daily electricity use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin miners faced intensifying financial pressure in February 2026 as the cryptocurrency&#39;s price of approximately $70,000 traded roughly 20% below the estimated average production cost of around $87,000, creating a profitability crisis across the industry. Bitcoin&#39;s network hashrate rebounded to 913 EH/s after experiencing significant volatility, having reached multiple all-time highs above 1 Zettahash/s (1,000 EH/s) in January 2026 before temporary weather-related curtailment caused sharp short-term declines. The surging hashrate to 894.5 EH/s increased the energy required to mine one Bitcoin to approximately 854,400 kWh, with daily Bitcoin mining now consuming more electricity than the entire country of Belgium over the same 24-hour period.</p>
<p>With revenues below operating costs, miners continued selling bitcoin holdings to fund day-to-day operations, cover energy expenses, and service debt, creating persistent selling pressure on the market. Major mining company HIVE produced 297 Bitcoin in January with 290% hashrate growth year-over-year, demonstrating the arms race dynamics driving hash power expansion even as individual mining profitability deteriorates. The next difficulty retarget scheduled for February 8-10, 2026, projects a downward adjustment of 16-18% to 116-121 trillion, representing one of the largest difficulty decreases in recent years and offering immediate margin relief if Bitcoin price stabilizes or climbs.</p>
<p>The combination of high production costs and compressed margins is forcing industry consolidation, with smaller and less efficient miners facing insolvency while well-capitalized operations with access to cheap renewable energy expand market share. The upcoming 16-18% difficulty drop offers a lifeline for struggling miners by reducing computational requirements and energy costs, potentially restoring profitability if Bitcoin price holds above $70,000. However, sustained prices below production costs threaten a wave of miner bankruptcies, equipment liquidations, and potential network security concerns if hashrate declines substantially in coming months.</p>
<h3>2. Crypto Theft Surges to $370 Million in January 2026 as Phishing Attacks Dominate - <em>Jan 31</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Cryptocurrency theft reached $370.3 million in January 2026, a 214% increase from December and four times January 2025 levels, with a single phishing incident accounting for $284 million as North Korean actors shift tactics from code exploits to operational compromise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry witnessed $370.3 million in theft during January 2026, marking a 214% increase from December and a fourfold rise from January 2025, according to blockchain security firm TRM Labs. A single phishing incident accounted for the majority of January&#39;s losses, with one victim losing $284 million to a social engineering scam, highlighting the evolving threat landscape as attackers shift from smart contract vulnerabilities to human-targeted deception. The rise in crypto thefts was driven largely by phishing attacks and social engineering schemes that often mimic legitimate services, such as customer support for wallet providers, to trick users into revealing sensitive information.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry witnessed over $3.4 billion in theft from January through early December 2025, with the February 21, 2025, compromise of Bybit alone accounting for $1.5 billion—the largest single theft of cryptocurrencies in the industry&#39;s history. Sophisticated actors, particularly those linked to North Korea (DPRK), are no longer just exploiting code vulnerabilities but are compromising the operational foundations of crypto asset services and the ecosystems around them. The Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea continues to pose the most significant nation-state threat to cryptocurrency security, achieving a record-breaking year for stolen funds despite an assessed dramatic reduction in attack frequency.</p>
<p>TRM Labs&#39; 2026 Crypto Crime Report indicates that while the total number of hacking incidents decreased in 2025, the average size of successful attacks increased substantially, suggesting attackers are focusing on higher-value targets and more sophisticated operational security compromises. Attack vectors have evolved from smart contract exploits and flash loan attacks to social engineering, insider threats, and supply chain compromises targeting infrastructure providers, exchanges, and custodians. The shift underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency crime from opportunistic code exploitation to organized, well-funded operations conducting reconnaissance, developing custom malware, and executing long-term infiltration campaigns against crypto companies.</p>
<h3>3. Circle&#39;s USDC Outpaces Tether&#39;s USDT Growth for Second Year as Fidelity Launches FIDD - <em>Jan 6</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Circle&#39;s USDC market cap increased 73% to $75.12 billion in 2025 while Tether&#39;s USDT added 36% to $186.6 billion, with Circle&#39;s outperformance driven by institutional demand for regulated stablecoins as Fidelity launches competing FIDD in February.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Circle Internet&#39;s USDC stablecoin grew faster than larger rival Tether&#39;s USDT for the second straight year in 2025, with USDC&#39;s market capitalization increasing 73% to $75.12 billion while USDT added 36% to $186.6 billion, fueled by rising institutional demand for regulated, blockchain-based dollars. JPMorgan analysis indicates USDC&#39;s outperformance is rooted in institutional demand for assets that meet regulatory guidelines, which prompted several high-profile investment banks and institutions to explore stablecoins, particularly regulated ones such as USDC. Tether&#39;s USDT remains unregulated in the U.S. and Europe, though the company operates as a licensed digital asset service provider in El Salvador.</p>
<p>The stablecoin landscape intensified in February 2026 with new entrants challenging the USDC-USDT duopoly. Fidelity Investments launched the Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD) stablecoin in early February to compete in the $308 billion stablecoin market, while Tether introduced USAT, its first U.S.-regulated dollar token aimed at institutional users, launched in partnership with federally chartered bank Anchorage Digital and Cantor Fitzgerald. USAT represents Tether&#39;s attempt to address regulatory criticism and capture institutional dollars that have increasingly favored Circle&#39;s USDC due to compliance and transparency concerns.</p>
<p>On February 4, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain reported that Tether&#39;s USDT and Circle&#39;s USDC collectively added more than $3 billion in newly minted supply over a three-day period, suggesting institutional accumulation or market-making activity despite the broader cryptocurrency market volatility. The entry of traditional finance giants like Fidelity validates the stablecoin market&#39;s importance while intensifying competitive pressure on Circle and Tether. Regulatory clarity remains the critical driver of stablecoin adoption, with Circle positioned to benefit from pending U.S. stablecoin legislation that would establish federal oversight and reserve requirements, potentially disadvantaging unregulated competitors.</p>
<h3>4. Solana and XRP Dominate Altcoin Season as ETF Launches Drive Institutional Flows - <em>Jan 2</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Solana hit 27.1 million active addresses in mid-January, a 56% weekly increase, while XRP ETFs attracted $1.37 billion in under 60 days with 43 consecutive days of positive inflows and exchange balances falling 57% to 1.7 billion tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solana and XRP emerged as the dominant altcoins of early 2026, with both networks experiencing explosive growth in adoption metrics, ETF inflows, and technical upgrades that position them as leading Layer-1 candidates for institutional integration. Solana became the most searched token since Q4 2024 and surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction volume, hitting 27.1 million active addresses in mid-January 2026, representing a 56% weekly increase. The network&#39;s planned major consensus upgrade with the new Alpenglow protocol, developed by Anza as a spinoff from Solana Labs, introduces Votor to finalize blocks in 100-150 milliseconds and Rotor, a more efficient data relay protocol.</p>
<p>XRP experienced a renaissance in early 2026 following Ripple&#39;s improved legal outlook after the SEC&#39;s dropped appeal and new XRP ETF approvals in global markets, positioning it as a regulated-friendly altcoin for institutional adoption. XRP ETFs attracted $1.37 billion in assets under management in under 60 days with 43 consecutive days of positive inflows, while exchange balances fell 57% to 1.7 billion tokens, suggesting holders are moving assets into long-term storage. Moscow Exchange (MOEX) announced plans to launch cash-settled futures tied to Solana, XRP, and TRON in 2026, expanding regulated derivative products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) also demonstrated strength, climbing 7% and outpacing broader market moves in early January, positioning itself as a leading Layer-1 candidate for meaningful growth in 2026 with advanced execution models, strong developer ecosystems, and real-world experimentation. The altcoin season narrative gained momentum as Bitcoin dominance declined from December peaks, with capital rotating into Layer-1 platforms offering smart contract functionality, DeFi ecosystems, and real-world payment applications. Analysts suggest Solana and XRP have strong potential to boom in 2026 due to major protocol upgrades, ETF optimism, rising institutional interest, and regulatory clarity that reduces legal uncertainty.</p>
<h3>5. Ethereum Maintains 68% DeFi Dominance as TVL Reaches $70 Billion Despite Competition - <em>Jan 6</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethereum accounts for approximately 68% of decentralized finance total value locked at $70 billion, exceeding Solana (8.96%), Bitcoin (6.67%), and all other chains combined as Layer-2 solutions and competitor blockchains compete for market share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ethereum maintained its overwhelming dominance of the decentralized finance sector in early 2026, accounting for approximately 68% of total value locked (TVL) at $70 billion, exceeding Solana, Tron, Arbitrum, and all other chains and Layer-2 solutions combined. The concentration of DeFi activity on Ethereum reflects the network&#39;s first-mover advantage, deep liquidity pools, extensive developer tooling, and battle-tested smart contract infrastructure that has weathered multiple market cycles and security challenges. Solana, the second-largest DeFi project by TVL, accounts for just 8.96% of the DeFi TVL share, while Bitcoin ranks third with 6.67% and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) holds fourth place.</p>
<p>The DeFi landscape in early January 2026 showed overall sector TVL has grown substantially from 2025 lows, driven by renewed interest in yield farming, liquid staking derivatives, and decentralized exchanges. However, Ethereum faces mounting competitive pressure from high-performance Layer-1 blockchains like Solana and Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism that offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees. The emergence of Bitcoin-based DeFi protocols leveraging wrapped BTC and Layer-2 networks demonstrates the expanding scope of decentralized finance beyond Ethereum&#39;s EVM ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite competition, Ethereum&#39;s DeFi dominance reflects network effects, liquidity depth, and institutional trust that create significant switching costs for users and protocols. The upcoming Ethereum protocol upgrades focused on scaling, blob space expansion, and account abstraction aim to reduce transaction costs and improve user experience while maintaining decentralization and security. Industry observers note that while Ethereum&#39;s DeFi market share may gradually decline as capital diversifies across multiple chains, the network is likely to retain majority dominance through 2026 given its established position, developer mindshare, and institutional integration.</p>

<h2>Dedollarisation &amp; US Dollar Trends</h2>
<h3>1. India&#39;s Forex Reserves Surge to Record $723.77 Billion Despite Rupee Hitting Historic Lows - <em>Jan 30</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>India&#39;s foreign exchange reserves reached an all-time high of $723.77 billion as of January 30, 2026, driven by a $10 billion RBI swap operation and gold revaluation gains, even as the rupee fell 0.4% against the dollar due to foreign fund outflows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>India&#39;s foreign exchange reserves surged to a record $723.77 billion as of January 30, 2026, marking a significant milestone as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bolstered its firepower to defend the rupee amid persistent depreciation pressure. The stockpile rose by approximately $8.05 billion to $709.4 billion in the week ended January 23, surpassing the previous high of $704.89 billion set in September 2024. In the week ended January 16, reserves jumped sharply by $14.167 billion to $701.36 billion, driven by both increased gold reserves and foreign currency assets.</p>
<p>Experts attributed the latest spurt in forex reserves to a $10 billion buy/sell swap the central bank conducted during the week, coupled with revaluation gains stemming from the rise in gold prices. Gold prices increased by 7.3% to $4,933 per ounce during the reported week, inflating the rupee value of India&#39;s substantial gold holdings. Despite the record reserves providing a buffer, the rupee fell 0.4% against the dollar during the week due to foreign fund outflows and delays in a trade deal between India and the United States, hitting a historic low of 85.93 in January.</p>
<p>The accumulation of forex reserves reflects the RBI&#39;s strategy to build defenses against external shocks, capital flight, and currency volatility, particularly as India navigates geopolitical tensions, global trade uncertainties, and domestic inflation pressures. The record reserves position India among the world&#39;s largest holders of foreign exchange, trailing only China, Japan, and Switzerland, and provide substantial capacity for the RBI to intervene in currency markets to prevent excessive rupee depreciation. However, the persistent weakness of the rupee despite record reserves highlights the structural challenges facing emerging market currencies amid dollar strength, rising U.S. interest rates, and global risk aversion.</p>
<h3>2. China&#39;s Digital Yuan CIPS Settlement System Expands to ASEAN and Middle East Nations - <em>Feb 7</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The People&#39;s Bank of China announced its digital RMB cross-border settlement system will be fully connected to ten ASEAN nations and six Middle Eastern countries, potentially enabling 38% of global trade to bypass SWIFT and settle in seconds rather than days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The People&#39;s Bank of China announced in February 2026 that its digital RMB cross-border settlement system would be fully connected to the ten ASEAN nations and six Middle Eastern countries, implying that approximately 38% of global trade could potentially bypass the U.S. dollar-dominated SWIFT network and settle using China&#39;s digital currency infrastructure. Unlike SWIFT, where transactions take between 3 and 5 days and involve multiple intermediaries, China&#39;s digital currency is designed to bridge payment systems and slash processing times to mere seconds, with a pilot project between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi demonstrating a payment settling in just about seven seconds with fees dropping by 98%.</p>
<p>China is accelerating its long-running effort to turn the yuan into a genuine global currency, with recent signals from Washington strengthening Beijing&#39;s resolve. President Xi Jinping has placed currency strength at the center of national power, defining it in outward-looking terms: international usage, trade settlement reach, influence in foreign-exchange markets, and reserve status. China has developed alternative payment systems such as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) and the digital yuan, facilitating transactions outside traditional networks like SWIFT, with CIPS expanding rapidly to reduce dependence on SWIFT and enhance RMB liquidity.</p>
<p>The yuan recently achieved a landmark share of global payments, with China&#39;s yuan hitting an internationalization milestone by capturing a record share of global payment value according to SWIFT data. However, Western analysts note the yuan still accounts for a small fraction of international transactions compared to the dollar and euro, and technical connectivity does not guarantee adoption if trading partners prefer dollar liquidity and stability. The digital yuan cross-border infrastructure represents China&#39;s most ambitious challenge to dollar dominance yet, but success depends on willing adoption by trade partners, regulatory frameworks in recipient countries, and confidence in yuan stability.</p>
<h3>3. Trump&#39;s Dollar Concerns Boost Xi&#39;s Global Yuan Ambitions as Renminbi Trade Settlement Accelerates - <em>Feb 3</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Trump&#39;s criticism of strong dollar policy is inadvertently boosting China&#39;s yuan internationalization push, as Beijing expands yuan trade settlement mechanisms and digital RMB adoption amid U.S. currency uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump&#39;s public concerns about the strong dollar are inadvertently strengthening China&#39;s hand in promoting global yuan adoption, as Beijing seizes on U.S. currency policy uncertainty to accelerate renminbi internationalization initiatives. Trump&#39;s dollar criticism, combined with tariff threats and trade tensions, has prompted trading partners to explore alternatives to dollar-denominated transactions, creating an opening for China&#39;s yuan that Beijing is aggressively pursuing. Xi Jinping has elevated currency strength as a pillar of national power, with yuan internationalization efforts focused on increasing trade settlement reach, foreign exchange market influence, and reserve currency status.</p>
<p>China&#39;s yuan is gaining traction as an international trade settlement currency, with multiple nations adopting the petroyuan for energy transactions, including Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, China, UAE, and Egypt as of January 2025. The yuan recently became the world&#39;s second main currency in trade settlements via SWIFT, though still dramatically trailing the dollar and euro in total volume. The People&#39;s Bank of China does not release statistics precise enough to confirm the exact share of China-Saudi oil trade settled in RMB, but industry sources confirm the first purchase of crude oil settled in digital yuan occurred in October 2023.</p>
<p>The strategic context for yuan internationalization has shifted dramatically, with BRICS nations expanding yuan usage for intra-bloc trade, the digital yuan cross-border infrastructure connecting to ASEAN and Middle East countries, and China&#39;s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) processing record volumes. However, fundamental challenges remain: the yuan is not freely convertible, Chinese capital controls limit liquidity, and the lack of transparent rule of law and independent central banking reduces confidence compared to dollar and euro alternatives. Trump&#39;s dollar skepticism may provide rhetorical support for yuan adoption, but structural barriers to displacing the dollar remain formidable.</p>
<h3>4. Commercial Real Estate Office Sector Faces 18% CMBS Delinquency as Vacancies Persist Near 23% - <em>Feb 1</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Office sector CMBS delinquency rates surged to nearly 18%, up 150 basis points year-over-year, as the commercial mortgage-backed security delinquency rate of 7.29% reaches nearly six times higher than traditional bank loans amid persistent vacancy rates near 23%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commercial real estate office sector faced intensifying financial stress in early 2026, with office sector delinquency rates increasing by 150 basis points over the past year to almost 18%, while the broader commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) delinquency rate reached 7.29%—nearly six times higher than traditional bank loans. Office vacancy rates closed 2025 at 18.4%, down 1.4% from 19.8% in December 2024, but many large markets continue to struggle with vacancy rates near 23%, indicating significant regional variation and persistent oversupply in major urban centers.</p>
<p>Moody&#39;s Analytics projects that commercial property vacancy rates will peak in 2026 at approximately 24% before beginning a gradual decline, with particular stress in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., where demand is insufficient to absorb high vacancies. Buildings with high shares of near-term lease expiries or elevated vacancies face inability to refinance as maturities approach, creating a wave of distressed asset sales and potential foreclosures. However, Moody&#39;s forecasts that a combination of continued economic growth and falling short-term interest rates will support borrowers&#39; ability to refinance their commercial real estate loans in 2026, leading securitization performance to improve in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>The office sector&#39;s struggles reflect structural shifts accelerated by the pandemic, including permanent remote and hybrid work arrangements that have reduced corporate space requirements, flight to quality as tenants consolidate into newer Class A buildings with modern amenities, and excess supply from the 2010s development boom that anticipated continued pre-pandemic office demand. The divergence between CMBS delinquency rates and traditional bank loan performance suggests that securitized office debt, often originated during the market peak, faces greater stress than more recent bank financing with conservative underwriting. Industry analysts anticipate office sector distress will persist through 2026, with gradual improvement dependent on demand recovery, building conversions to residential use, and the absorption of excess supply through demolitions and repurposing.</p>
<h3>5. Student Loan Forgiveness Becomes Taxable as Federal Exemption Expires January 1, 2026 - <em>Jan 1</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>A temporary federal exemption making student loan forgiveness tax-free expired on January 1, 2026, with debt canceled under income-driven repayment plans now counting as taxable income, though Public Service Loan Forgiveness remains tax-exempt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Student loan borrowers face a significant new financial burden in 2026 as a temporary federal exemption that made student loan forgiveness tax-free expired on January 1, 2026, with debt canceled under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans now counting as taxable income at the federal level. The change does not apply to debt canceled through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), which has always been tax-free at the federal level and remains so under current law. However, borrowers who anticipate qualifying for IDR forgiveness in 2026 should plan for a larger tax bill when filing their 2027 returns.</p>
<p>Federal Student Aid announced new guidance for loan servicers to move recertification dates back for those affected by the department&#39;s processing pause to at least February 2026, providing temporary relief for millions of borrowers. While IDR applications are not currently being processed, borrowers already enrolled in the plans will not see payment hikes as a result of the new guidance. Beginning July 1, 2026, the Education Department will offer a new kind of income-driven repayment plan called the repayment assistance plan, restructuring repayment options, terms for many loans, and eligibility for some post-graduate financing.</p>
<p>The tax treatment change affects borrowers who have been making payments under IDR plans for 20-25 years and qualify for remaining balance forgiveness, potentially creating tax bills of tens of thousands of dollars for borrowers whose forgiven amounts are treated as ordinary income. Financial advisors recommend borrowers anticipating forgiveness in 2026 begin setting aside funds for the tax liability or explore installment agreement options with the IRS. The expiration of the tax exemption represents a significant policy shift that reduces the value of income-driven repayment forgiveness and complicates financial planning for the millions of borrowers enrolled in IDR plans, potentially creating hardship for those unprepared for the tax consequences of debt cancellation.</p>
