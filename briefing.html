<h3>1. US-Iran Nuclear Talks Conclude in Oman with Agreement to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States and Iran concluded indirect nuclear talks mediated by Oman in Muscat on Friday, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi calling the session &quot;a good start&quot; focused solely on the nuclear issue, as both sides agreed to hold follow-on discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met directly with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi during the day-long session, which ran from 10 AM to 6 PM local time with Oman serving as intermediary between the two delegations. The talks represented the first restart of nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Tehran since last summer&#39;s military strikes against Iran, and focused exclusively on Iran&#39;s nuclear program rather than broader regional issues, according to IRNA.</p>
<p>The talks took place against a backdrop of massive U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf, with President Trump warning he could pivot to military action if negotiations fail to produce results quickly. Prediction markets now price a U.S. strike on Iran by mid-February at 31%, rising to 44% by month&#39;s end. The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has driven strike odds higher, particularly after an F-35 from the carrier shot down an Iranian Shahed-139 drone on February 3 that &quot;aggressively approached&quot; the ship.</p>
<p>In a sign that Washington intends to maintain economic pressure alongside diplomacy, the administration announced new sanctions on the same day talks concluded, targeting 15 entities, two individuals, and 14 shadow fleet vessels linked to Iran&#39;s illicit oil trade. The inconclusive outcome — characterized as suspended &quot;for now&quot; rather than collapsed — leaves open the possibility of resumed negotiations, though the timeline remains unclear as both sides face significant domestic political constraints.</p>

<h3>2. Ukraine Peace Talks in Abu Dhabi Yield Prisoner Swap and Military Dialogue Agreement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two days of trilateral peace talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in Abu Dhabi produced a deal to exchange 314 prisoners of war — the first such swap since September — and an agreement to reestablish high-level U.S.-Russia military-to-military dialogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced Thursday that the talks had yielded concrete results, with both sides agreeing to the prisoner exchange and the restoration of direct military communication channels between Washington and Moscow. Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev said there was &quot;positive movement forward,&quot; while Ukraine&#39;s lead negotiator Rustem Umerov described the discussions as &quot;substantive and productive, focused on concrete steps and practical solutions.&quot;</p>
<p>The main sticking point remains the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine. Moscow demands Kyiv withdraw troops from all of the Donetsk region, including a line of heavily fortified cities regarded as one of Ukraine&#39;s strongest defenses. Ukraine insists the conflict should be frozen along the current front lines and rejects any unilateral pullback. President Zelensky revealed ahead of the talks that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, with a &quot;large number&quot; still officially missing — though independent estimates from CSIS place the toll between 100,000 and 140,000.</p>
<p>The talks mark a significant diplomatic milestone as the war approaches its fourth anniversary this month, with the fact that all three parties are engaging directly described as notable in itself. However, European allies have expressed concern about being excluded from the process, and the fundamental territorial disputes appear far from resolution. A third round of talks has not yet been formally announced.</p>

<h3>3. Islamabad Mosque Suicide Bombing Kills 31 in Deadliest Attack on Capital Since 2008</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A suicide bomber attacked the Khadija Tul Kubra Mosque, a Shia mosque in Islamabad&#39;s southeastern Tarlai Kalan neighborhood, during Friday congregational prayers, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 169 in the deadliest attack on Pakistan&#39;s capital since the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attacker was stopped at the mosque&#39;s entrance by security personnel before opening fire and detonating explosives inside or near the mosque, causing significant structural damage and scattering debris across the surrounding area. ISIL&#39;s Pakistan branch (ISPP) claimed responsibility for what appears to be its deadliest operation in the country since its formation in May 2019. Pakistani authorities arrested four alleged &quot;facilitators&quot; on February 7 as thousands of mourners attended funeral prayers for the victims.</p>
<p>The attack comes amid a surge in militant violence across Pakistan, following the Balochistan Liberation Army&#39;s &quot;Operation Herof 2.0&quot; in late January that killed over 225 people across nine districts. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the bombing as a &quot;cowardly act of terrorism&quot; and declared a state of emergency in the capital, with hospitals appealing for blood donations. The UN Secretary-General also condemned the attack, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>The bombing has sharpened focus on cross-border security challenges, with Pakistani officials pointing to militant safe havens along the Afghan-Pakistan border. The escalating violence — from Balochistan separatist attacks to sectarian bombings in the capital — underscores the breadth of security threats facing Pakistan&#39;s government as it struggles to contain multiple insurgent and extremist movements simultaneously.</p>

<h3>4. Russia Escalates Hybrid Warfare Across Europe with Sabotage and Infrastructure Attacks</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia has dramatically escalated its hybrid warfare campaign against Western Europe since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with intelligence reports confirming a four-fold increase in sabotage operations in 2024 compared to the prior year and the surge accelerating through 2025 and into 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polish authorities revealed that two Ukrainian citizens hired by Russian intelligence used explosives to attempt to destroy a Warsaw-Ukraine railway line in November 2025 — a route crucially important for delivering military aid to Ukraine. A train conductor noticed the warped rail near the village of Mika, approximately 130 kilometers from the Polish-Ukrainian border, and alerted police. Poland subsequently expelled Russia&#39;s consul in Gdansk, and Interpol issued red notices for the two suspects, believed to have fled to Belarus.</p>
<p>Experts identify three pillars of Russian hybrid warfare expected to escalate in 2026: sabotage targeting Europe&#39;s expanding defense production infrastructure and Ukraine-bound supply chains; subversion through information warfare during key elections including Hungary&#39;s 2026 vote and the U.S. midterms; and coercion through increasingly aggressive airspace and naval violations. The attack on Romania&#39;s Cugir arms factory last year demonstrated Russia&#39;s willingness to target defense manufacturing directly.</p>
<p>Moscow&#39;s strategic objective is to weaken Western unity by creating a constant sense of vulnerability without crossing the threshold that would trigger a formal NATO response. Analysts warn that Europe still lacks credible hybrid deterrence, and the West&#39;s failure to establish clear thresholds for hybrid warfare has created a strategic vacuum that Russia continues to exploit. The campaign has expanded from espionage into drone-based airport shutdowns, arson attacks, and direct targeting of critical infrastructure.</p>

<h3>5. State Department Orders Deletion of All Pre-Trump Social Media Posts from Official Accounts</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. State Department has directed the removal of all posts made by its official accounts on the social media platform X before President Trump returned to office on January 20, 2025, with staff told that anyone wanting to access the deleted content must file a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The directive applies to all the department&#39;s active official X accounts, including those for U.S. embassies and missions worldwide, ambassadors, department bureaus, and programs, according to internal guidance screenshots obtained by NPR. The posts to be removed include embassy July 4th livestreams, photos of COVID vaccine donations to other nations, holiday greetings, condolences, cultural programming, and the day-to-day record of diplomatic engagements showing who the U.S. met with, when, and how.</p>
<p>Current and former State Department employees, as well as academics, have raised concerns that the purge will make the historical record of government communications and actions harder to trace. While the posts will be internally archived, requiring FOIA requests for access differs significantly from how the U.S. government typically handles archiving the online footprint of previous administrations. Critics argue the move effectively erases the public digital record of American diplomacy spanning multiple years.</p>
<p>The social media purge comes as the State Department undergoes broader changes under the Trump administration, with the deletion order representing one of the most sweeping acts of institutional digital erasure in modern U.S. government history. The move raises questions about government transparency and the preservation of public records, particularly as social media has become a primary channel through which governments communicate with domestic and international audiences.</p>

<h3>6. Colombia-Ecuador Trade War Escalates with Tit-for-Tat Tariffs and Energy Cutoffs</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecuador&#39;s imposition of a 30% &quot;security tariff&quot; on Colombian imports over drug trafficking failures has spiraled into a full-scale trade war, with Colombia retaliating by halting electricity exports, imposing reciprocal tariffs, and Ecuador responding with a 900% increase in oil pipeline fees for Colombian crude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crisis erupted when President Daniel Noboa announced Ecuador would levy a 30% tariff on its neighbor until Colombia showed &quot;a real commitment to jointly confronting drug-trafficking and illegal mining at the border.&quot; Colombia&#39;s Ministry of Commerce responded with a 30% tariff on 23 Ecuadorian products, while the Ministry of Mines and Energy announced an indefinite suspension of all international electricity sales to Ecuador, framing the move as essential to safeguarding Colombia&#39;s energy sovereignty.</p>
<p>The escalation has spread to energy infrastructure, with Ecuador raising the tariff for each barrel of Colombian oil transported through its state-owned Trans-Ecuadorian Oil Pipeline System from $3 to $30 per barrel — a 900% increase. Colombian and Ecuadorian merchants and truckers have staged protests at border crossings, warning that the trade war will devastate border economies and disrupt energy supplies in both countries. The reciprocal tariffs are affecting bilateral commerce worth approximately $2.3 billion annually.</p>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro met with President Trump in Washington on February 3 and reportedly asked the U.S. to mediate the dispute. Ecuador faces a trade deficit of more than $1 billion with Colombia, and Noboa has framed the tariffs as a national security measure against narcotics trafficking. However, analysts warn that the economic fallout — particularly the suspension of Colombian electricity to an energy-dependent Ecuador — risks creating a humanitarian dimension to what began as a diplomatic dispute.</p>

<h3>7. US Government Shutdown Ends But DHS Faces Second Closure as ICE Reform Talks Stall</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The partial U.S. government shutdown that began January 31 ended on February 3 when Trump signed a $1 trillion spending package, but the Department of Homeland Security faces a second shutdown on February 13 as negotiations over ICE reform demands remain deadlocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The House approved the spending package 217-214, funding several of the government&#39;s largest departments through September. However, the deal separated DHS funding into a two-week extension, giving lawmakers until February 13 to negotiate Democratic demands for immigration enforcement reforms prompted by the killings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti during ICE operations in Minneapolis. Democrats are demanding body cameras, identification requirements, a ban on agents hiding their identities, and judicial warrants for enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer issued a list of 10 demands, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune described reaching agreement in the remaining time as &quot;an impossibility.&quot; Republicans say they are open to body-worn cameras — already included in the underlying DHS spending bill with $20 million allocated — but reject warrant restrictions and mask bans. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered body cameras for agents in Minneapolis but Democrats want reforms codified into law rather than relying on executive discretion.</p>
<p>The funding impasse has broader consequences beyond DHS operations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39; January jobs report was delayed from February 7 to February 11 due to the shutdown&#39;s disruption of data collection. With only days remaining before the DHS funding deadline, the prospect of a second partial shutdown looms large, creating additional uncertainty for markets and federal employees already rattled by the first closure.</p>

<h3>8. Zelensky Reveals 55,000 Ukrainian Soldiers Killed as War Nears Fourth Anniversary</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky disclosed that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, with a &quot;large number&quot; still officially missing, as the war approaches its fourth anniversary amid ongoing peace talks in Abu Dhabi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure represents a significant increase from Zelensky&#39;s previous disclosures — 46,000 killed reported in February 2025 and 31,000 in February 2024 — suggesting the pace of casualties has not meaningfully slowed despite changes in the front-line dynamics. Independent estimates from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies place the actual toll significantly higher, between 100,000 and 140,000 killed, suggesting official figures substantially undercount the true cost of the conflict.</p>
<p>Zelensky&#39;s revelation came in an interview with French media ahead of the second round of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi, timed to build public support for meaningful negotiations as European and American audiences increasingly focus on the war&#39;s human cost. The disclosure represents a rare moment of public candor from Kyiv, which has generally withheld detailed casualty figures to maintain domestic morale and international support.</p>
<p>The fourth winter of Russia&#39;s war has been particularly brutal, with heat and electricity blackouts lasting for days as Russia repeatedly targets Ukraine&#39;s energy grid. The toll on Ukrainian society extends far beyond military casualties, with millions displaced internally and abroad. As peace talks continue, the cumulative human cost of the war — now acknowledged at unprecedented scale by Ukraine&#39;s own president — is increasingly shaping the calculus of all parties involved in negotiations.</p>

<h3>9. Winter Olympics Competition Begins with First Gold Medals Awarded in Milan Cortina</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2026 Winter Olympics entered full competition mode on Saturday, with Swiss racer Franjo von Allmen capturing the Olympic downhill to win the first gold medal of the Milan Cortina Games, as medal events begin across cross-country skiing, speed skating, snowboarding, and other disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day after Thursday&#39;s spectacular opening ceremony at Milan&#39;s San Siro stadium — which featured dual cauldron lightings in Milan and Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo and performances by Andrea Bocelli and Mariah Carey — athletes from 93 countries began competing across venues spanning northern Italy&#39;s Lombardy and Veneto regions. The Games, Italy&#39;s first Winter Olympics since Turin 2006, feature 116 medal events across 16 disciplines through February 22.</p>
<p>One of the most closely watched storylines is American alpine skiing legend Lindsey Vonn, who announced her return to professional racing in November 2024 with the goal of competing in Milan Cortina. However, just a week before the opening ceremony, Vonn crashed in Crans Montana, Switzerland, completely rupturing her ACL. Despite the injury, she has confirmed she will race in the women&#39;s downhill on Sunday, February 8, in what would be a remarkable feat of determination.</p>
<p>The Games carry significant geopolitical undertones as the world&#39;s athletes compete against a backdrop of ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, rising U.S.-Iran tensions, and trade disputes across multiple continents. The ceremony&#39;s theme of &quot;Harmony&quot; — reflecting the connection between Milan and Cortina despite the physical distance — offers a contrast to the fractured state of international relations outside the Olympic venues.</p>

<h3>10. EU-China Trade Tensions Deepen as Beijing&#39;s Industrial Overcapacity Threatens European Manufacturing</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Union faces what economists are calling a second &quot;China shock&quot; as Beijing&#39;s industrial overcapacity spreads beyond electric vehicles into semiconductors, wind components, pharmaceuticals, and industrial machinery, threatening the foundations of Europe&#39;s manufacturing base while bilateral trade imbalances widen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China now accounts for roughly one-third of total global value-added manufacturing, with its trade surplus approaching $1 trillion last year as domestic consumption fails to keep pace with industrial output. The EU, as China&#39;s largest export partner, is piling up protective measures including a planned fixed customs duty on low-value e-commerce parcels from July 2026, aimed at curbing cheap imports predominantly from China. Meanwhile, China has retaliated against EU electric vehicle tariffs by targeting European dairy, brandy, and pork imports.</p>
<p>The semiconductor dimension adds a strategic security layer to the economic tensions. Beijing has long argued the EU could help rebalance trade by selling advanced chips and manufacturing equipment currently under export restrictions, but European leaders remain wary of enabling Chinese technological advancement in sensitive areas. A recent shift in U.S. policy — with Trump authorizing sales of some advanced Nvidia chips to China — has complicated Europe&#39;s own calculus, as analysts note that outright restrictions have paradoxically incentivized China to develop its own semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>A critical moment approaches with China&#39;s anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy imports set to conclude on February 21, with provisional tariffs on European dairy products already reduced from as high as 42.7% to 11.7%. On the EV front, both sides have made progress toward a minimum price mechanism that could replace punitive tariffs. However, the structural challenge remains: Chinese overinvestment across a range of industries shows no signs of abating, leaving Europe caught between protecting domestic industry and maintaining access to affordable goods.</p>

<h3>1. Gold Surges Past $5,000 to Record Highs as Safe-Haven Demand Soars</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gold blasted through the $5,000 per ounce barrier for the first time in history, surging to $5,078 on Wednesday in its strongest single-day rally in 20 years, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, central bank buying, and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The precious metal&#39;s ascent has been staggering — up 73.6% compared to a year ago and 11.4% in just the past month. Central bank purchases have been a major catalyst, with Beijing extending its gold-buying streak for a 13th consecutive month, adding 30,000 ounces to reserves and bringing China&#39;s total stock to 74.12 million ounces. The de-dollarization trend among emerging market central banks has created sustained structural demand independent of traditional safe-haven flows.</p>
<p>JPMorgan issued its most bullish gold forecast yet at $6,300 per ounce by year-end 2026, while Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale target $6,000. The rally reflects a convergence of factors rarely seen simultaneously: rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the ongoing Ukraine war, persistent inflation concerns, a weakening U.S. dollar, and growing uncertainty about the trajectory of Federal Reserve policy. Gold&#39;s breakout above $5,000 triggered significant momentum-driven buying.</p>
<p>However, the rally has not been without volatility. After reaching $5,600 intraday on February 4, gold experienced a sharp pullback to $4,770 by Friday, a correction of nearly 15% that rattled traders who had chased the breakout higher. The whipsaw action underscores the speculative froth that has entered the gold market alongside genuine safe-haven demand, with analysts warning that while the structural bull case remains intact, the pace of gains has created conditions ripe for violent corrections.</p>

<h3>2. Palantir Surges 11% After Blowout Earnings as AI Government Spending Boom Lifts Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Technologies reported Q4 2025 revenue of $1.41 billion — up 70% year-over-year — beating estimates of $1.33 billion with adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share versus expectations of 23 cents, sending shares up 11% as CEO Alex Karp called it &quot;the best results that I&#39;m aware of in tech in the last decade.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. commercial revenue surged 137% to $507 million, while government revenue grew 66% year-over-year, driven by new contracts including a $448 million U.S. Navy deal to launch ShipOS for AI-powered shipbuilding modernization. Total contract value reached $4.26 billion, up 138% from the prior year. The Pentagon&#39;s 2026 budget request included a record $13.4 billion dedicated line item for AI — the first in DoD history — positioning Palantir as a primary beneficiary of the government AI spending wave.</p>
<p>Management guided 2026 revenue to $7.18-$7.20 billion, implying an accelerated growth rate above 60% that would make Palantir the fastest company in software history to approach $10 billion in annual revenue at its current margins. The guidance far exceeded Wall Street expectations and triggered a wave of analyst upgrades. William Blair upgraded shares to Buy ahead of the report with a $200 price target, and multiple firms raised their estimates following the results.</p>
<p>The stock&#39;s valuation remains a point of contention, with Palantir trading at approximately 174 times forward earnings and a forward price-to-sales ratio of 67.5. While the growth trajectory is exceptional, the rich multiple exposes the stock to sharp corrections on any disappointment. The company&#39;s positioning at the intersection of government AI spending and commercial enterprise adoption has made it one of the market&#39;s most debated stocks, with bulls pointing to the unprecedented demand environment and bears arguing that the valuation already prices in perfection.</p>

<h3>3. Crude Oil Surges to Six-Month Highs on Iran Risk Premium Before Diplomatic Whipsaw</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent crude oil breached $72 per barrel, marking a six-month high as the U.S.-Iran standoff drove a geopolitical risk premium estimated at $7-$8 per barrel, before crashing back toward $60 on Friday as diplomatic progress in Oman talks drained the war premium overnight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rally saw prices climb nearly 12% from the start of the year, fueled by the U.S. Navy&#39;s deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the Arabian Sea and the subsequent shoot-down of an Iranian Shahed-139 drone on February 3. Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard Corps also harassed a U.S.-flagged merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, with two IRGC boats and a drone threatening to board and seize the tanker Stena Imperative — escalating fears of a disruption to the waterway through which a fifth of global oil and LNG passes.</p>
<p>Energy analysts placed the probability of a U.S. strike on Iran at 75% in the coming weeks, while Polymarket volumes on Iran strike prediction markets hit $188 million. OPEC+ added to supply uncertainty by extending voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through Q1 2026, with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other producers agreeing to pause planned output increases. BloombergNEF projected oil could reach $91 per barrel by late 2026 in an Iran disruption scenario.</p>
<p>The dramatic reversal came Friday after diplomatic talks in Oman produced what Iran called &quot;a good start,&quot; with crude plunging back toward $60 as the risk premium evaporated almost instantly. The volatile week illustrated how geopolitical speculation has become the dominant short-term driver of energy markets, overwhelming fundamental factors like demand weakness and projected oversupply. The EIA forecasts Brent averaging just $56 per barrel in 2026 if geopolitical tensions ease — a staggering gap from the $72 highs reached during the week&#39;s peak anxiety.</p>

<h3>4. Bitcoin Plummets Below $61,000 in Worst Single-Day Crash Since FTX Collapse</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin suffered its steepest one-day decline since the FTX-driven crash in November 2022, plunging 15% to touch $60,062 as forced deleveraging cascaded through cryptocurrency markets, triggering $2.6 billion in liquidations and marking a 52% drawdown from its October 2025 record high of $126,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff accelerated through the week as multiple negative catalysts converged: institutional demand reversed with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recording outsized net outflows, leveraged positions worth billions were forcibly unwound, and broader risk-off sentiment from the equity market tech rout spilled into digital assets. Record realized losses of approximately $3.2 billion were recorded on February 5 alone, while the total crypto market shed roughly $900 billion in market capitalization over the preceding 22 days.</p>
<p>Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan characterized the decline as &quot;a full-bore, 2022-like crypto winter,&quot; while prediction markets placed a 56% probability on Bitcoin sliding to $70,000 or below before month&#39;s end. The token briefly recovered to $69,632 on Friday, gaining 9% in a relief bounce, but analysts warned the technical damage may take considerable time to repair. The unwinding of leveraged bets has wiped out all gains accumulated since President Trump&#39;s election.</p>
<p>The crypto winter marks a dramatic reversal from the optimism that surrounded Trump&#39;s pro-crypto stance, his appointment of crypto-friendly regulators, and the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Despite these policy tailwinds, macroeconomic headwinds — including equity market volatility, geopolitical uncertainty, rising correlations with risk assets, and waning institutional appetite — have overwhelmed the bullish narrative. The total cryptocurrency market lost approximately $350 billion in a single day on February 6, with the selloff extending to Ethereum, Solana, and virtually every major digital asset.</p>

<h3>5. Disney Names Josh D&#39;Amaro as Next CEO to Succeed Bob Iger Effective March 18</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney Company named Josh D&#39;Amaro, the 28-year company veteran who leads its Experiences division encompassing theme parks, cruise ships, and resorts, as its next chief executive officer to replace Bob Iger, marking the second CEO succession attempt in six years after Iger&#39;s previous pick Bob Chapek was ousted in 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D&#39;Amaro&#39;s appointment comes with a compensation package worth up to $45 million, with Iger remaining as a board member and senior advisor through the end of 2026. Dana Walden was simultaneously named president and chief creative officer, reporting to D&#39;Amaro effective March 18. The transition ends a closely watched succession process that had narrowed to D&#39;Amaro and Walden as the two internal frontrunners, with the board ultimately selecting the executive whose division generates the company&#39;s highest margins.</p>
<p>Disney reported fiscal Q1 2026 results the same week, with revenue of $25.98 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.63 beating analyst expectations of $25.74 billion and $1.57 respectively. Strength in parks and streaming drove the outperformance, though shares initially dropped 7% after the company warned of headwinds from declining international tourist attendance at domestic parks — a trend attributed to the strong U.S. dollar and global economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>D&#39;Amaro inherits a company navigating multiple strategic crossroads: the streaming business has turned profitable but faces intensifying competition, the parks division requires massive capital investment to maintain competitive advantages, and the traditional media business continues its structural decline. Analysts note that D&#39;Amaro&#39;s parks background positions him well for Disney&#39;s highest-margin business but raises questions about his approach to content strategy and the company&#39;s evolving relationship with technology platforms.</p>

<h3>6. UPS to Cut 30,000 Jobs in 2026 as Amazon Breakup Reshapes Delivery Giant</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 27</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>United Parcel Service announced plans to eliminate 30,000 positions in 2026 through attrition and voluntary separation programs, while closing 24 buildings in the first half of the year, as the shipping giant continues unwinding its partnership with Amazon in a transformation expected to save $3 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The job cuts follow 48,000 positions eliminated in 2025, making UPS one of the largest sources of U.S. job losses over the two-year period. The company reduced Amazon&#39;s volume by approximately 1 million packages per day in 2025 and plans to cut another million pieces daily in 2026, reducing total operational hours by approximately 25 million. The Amazon wind-down represents a deliberate strategic pivot away from low-margin e-commerce delivery toward higher-value healthcare, small business, and specialty shipping markets.</p>
<p>The reductions will be accomplished primarily through attrition, with UPS offering a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers. The 24 buildings identified for closure in the first half of 2026 reflect the shrinking physical footprint needed as Amazon volumes decline, with additional closures possible later in the year. The company&#39;s network optimization efforts aim to improve operating margins that had been compressed by the high-volume, low-margin Amazon business.</p>
<p>The announcement contributed to January&#39;s overall layoff total of 108,435 — the highest January figure since 2009 — alongside Amazon&#39;s own 16,000 cuts and significant reductions in healthcare, technology, and financial services. The UPS transformation underscores a broader restructuring across logistics and transportation as companies reassess business relationships and workforce needs in a slowing economy. Analysts note that while the short-term pain is significant, the strategic pivot should improve UPS&#39;s margin profile and competitive positioning over the medium term.</p>

<h3>7. OPEC+ Extends Production Cuts Through Q1 2026 as Iran Tensions Reshape Oil Markets</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eight key OPEC+ producers — Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman — agreed to maintain voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through March 2026, pausing planned output increases due to seasonal factors and geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision, made during a virtual meeting on February 1, keeps the alliance&#39;s most significant production restraint in place through the first quarter, with the previously announced barrels to be returned to the market &quot;either in part or in full, depending on evolving market conditions, and only in a gradual manner.&quot; The group&#39;s next meeting is scheduled for March, when members will reassess conditions including the trajectory of U.S.-Iran tensions, Chinese demand recovery, and the impact of potential tariff escalation on global economic growth.</p>
<p>The production freeze comes as geopolitical factors have overtaken fundamentals as the primary driver of oil prices. Brent crude rallied to $72 per barrel — its highest level in six months — on fears of a U.S. military strike on Iran, with analysts estimating a $7-$8 per barrel risk premium embedded in prices. The rally temporarily masked a more bearish fundamental outlook: the EIA forecasts global oil production will exceed demand in 2026, causing inventories to rise and prices to average just $56 per barrel absent major supply disruptions.</p>
<p>Internal OPEC+ dynamics remain strained despite the show of unity. A Saudi-UAE spat over production quotas continues to simmer, with the UAE pressing for a larger output allocation to match its expanded production capacity. Compensation cuts have tripled as key producers move to rein in members who exceeded quotas. Meanwhile, the potential disruption of Iranian supply through military action or tighter sanctions adds a wildcard that could dramatically alter the supply-demand balance and force OPEC+ to recalibrate its strategy.</p>

<h3>8. Dow Crosses 50,000 for First Time as Friday Rally Caps Volatile Week</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,207 points, or 2.47%, to close at a record 50,115 on Friday, crossing the 50,000 milestone for the first time as investors rotated aggressively from battered technology stocks into value names, financials, and industrials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The historic close capped one of the most volatile weeks in recent market memory, during which the S&amp;P 500 briefly turned negative for 2026, the Nasdaq endured a tech-driven rout, and South Korea&#39;s KOSPI triggered three circuit breakers in five sessions. Friday&#39;s rally was broad-based, with chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom gaining 7.8% and 7.2% respectively as investors reconsidered the selloff&#39;s severity. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1.97% to 6,932, while the Nasdaq advanced 2.18% to 23,031.</p>
<p>Despite the Friday surge, the week revealed deepening fractures beneath the market&#39;s surface. The &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; mega-cap stocks diverged sharply: Alphabet&#39;s $185 billion AI spending plan initially spooked investors before shares recovered, while Amazon plunged 8% on its own $200 billion capex forecast and an earnings miss. The rotation from growth into value accelerated, with the Dow&#39;s 2.5% weekly gain contrasting with the Nasdaq&#39;s 1.8% weekly decline.</p>
<p>The Dow&#39;s milestone comes in a markedly different character than previous round-number breakthroughs, driven less by broad economic optimism than by a flight from overvalued technology shares into defensive sectors. Manufacturing data provided a tailwind, with ISM and S&amp;P Global PMIs showing the sharpest increase in production since May 2022. However, the delayed January jobs report, ongoing government shutdown uncertainty, and unresolved questions about AI spending returns leave investors navigating with limited visibility into the economy&#39;s true trajectory.</p>

<h3>9. ECB and Bank of England Hold Rates as Central Banks Navigate Growth-Inflation Dilemma</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank held rates unchanged at 2% for a fifth consecutive meeting while the Bank of England voted 5-4 to maintain rates at 3.75% in a closer-than-expected decision, as both central banks grappled with persistent inflation against a backdrop of weakening growth and external risks from U.S. tariff threats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bank of England&#39;s narrow vote surprised markets, with four members pushing for a 25-basis-point cut to 3.5% versus forecasts of a 7-2 hold. The tight margin signals growing internal divisions over the pace of monetary easing, with pay growth and services price inflation continuing to ease while the UK economy shows signs of strain. UK borrowing costs came under additional pressure from the Mandelson-Epstein political crisis, adding to the challenging backdrop for policymakers.</p>
<p>ECB President Christine Lagarde played down concerns about the euro&#39;s recent strength but warned the outlook remained &quot;unpredictable&quot; given tariff threats and currency volatility. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the rest of 2026, with the updated assessment confirming inflation should stabilize at the 2% target in the medium term. Eurozone economies continue to grapple with weak manufacturing output and uncertain trade policy under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The coordinated holds reflect the global challenge facing central bankers as the post-pandemic inflation cycle enters its final phase. U.S. Treasury yields fell to around 4.22% on the 10-year as weaker employment data reinforced bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts, with markets pricing a first reduction in June and a second potentially in September. The divergence between a data-dependent Fed and a politically constrained ECB creates cross-currents in currency and bond markets that add complexity to an already challenging investment landscape.</p>

<h3>10. Amazon Falls 8% on $200 Billion AI Spending Forecast Despite Strong AWS Growth</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon shares plunged 8% on Friday after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results — with earnings per share of $1.95 missing estimates of $1.97 — and stunned investors by projecting $200 billion in 2026 capital expenditure, the largest spending commitment of any technology company in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AWS revenue expanded 24% in Q4 to beat expectations, marking what the unit&#39;s CEO called &quot;the fastest growth in 13 quarters,&quot; while total company revenue of $213.39 billion topped the $211.33 billion consensus. However, the bottom-line miss combined with the staggering capex guidance triggered an immediate selloff as investors questioned the returns timeline on such massive AI infrastructure investment. The spending plan represents a near-doubling from 2025 levels and would make Amazon the second-largest corporate capital spender after Alphabet, which announced its own $185 billion plan days earlier.</p>
<p>The combined $385 billion in AI spending commitments from just two companies in a single week crystallized investor anxiety about the AI investment cycle. Big Tech&#39;s aggregate AI capital expenditure is now approaching $700 billion, with investors increasingly asking whether these investments can generate proportional returns within a reasonable timeframe. The market&#39;s negative reaction to Amazon&#39;s plans contrasted with Alphabet&#39;s relatively muted response, suggesting that investor tolerance for AI spending escalation is reaching a breaking point.</p>
<p>Despite the near-term concerns, Amazon&#39;s cloud computing business showed genuine strength, with AWS operating income and margins improving as AI workloads drive higher-value consumption patterns. The company is investing in custom AI chips, data center construction, and networking infrastructure to serve demand from enterprise customers and its own AI services. Analysts remain broadly positive on the stock&#39;s long-term trajectory but acknowledge that the sheer scale of capital commitment creates meaningful execution risk and limits near-term earnings growth.</p>

<h3>1. Thailand Votes in Snap Election as Political Crisis Deepens with Cambodia Border Tensions</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thailand&#39;s snap general elections are underway on February 8, with 53 million eligible voters deciding the composition of the House of Representatives and voting on whether to replace the 2017 constitution, as Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul&#39;s coalition collapse coincides with escalating border tensions with Cambodia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai party, called for the dissolution of Parliament due to the inability to reach a consensus with the Prachachon party, his coalition partner, on constitutional reform. About 53 million people in the kingdom of 71 million are eligible to vote for the 500-seat House of Representatives through a mixed electoral system. Polling stations opened at 8am (01:00 GMT) and will close at 5pm (10:00 GMT), with vote counting beginning shortly after and results announced as tallies are completed.</p>
<p>A Suan Dusit University survey of 26,661 people between January 16-28 gave the progressive People&#39;s Party 36% support, with Pheu Thai at 22.1% and Bhumjaithai at 18.9%. The People&#39;s Party has been campaigning heavily before the election, with support stirring hope that the democratic future it promises may finally be within reach. The election represents a critical moment for Thai democracy, with voters weighing whether to break free from years of military-backed governance and constitutional constraints that have limited civilian political power.</p>
<p>The early election call reflects the worsening of the Thai political crisis, which coincides with increased tensions on the border with Cambodia. The Election Commission expects to know more than 90% of the unofficial vote count by around 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM local time. The official results will be announced on April 9, whereby the new House will then convene to elect a new prime minister and parliamentary speakers within 15 days, setting the stage for potential political transformation in Southeast Asia&#39;s second-largest economy.</p>
<h3>2. Haiti&#39;s Transitional Presidential Council Dissolves After Two Years of Tumultuous Rule</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haiti&#39;s presidential council stepped down on February 7 after almost two years of tumultuous rule, handing power to US-backed Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime as the country prepares for its first general elections in a decade amid rampant gang violence that has left thousands dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Transitional Presidential Council handed power to Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime after almost two years of tumultuous governance marked by rampant gang violence, with the transfer of power taking place on Saturday under tight security. The Council was sworn in at the National Palace on April 25, 2024, to exercise the powers and duties of the president of Haiti either until an elected president is inaugurated or until February 7, 2026, whichever came first—making Saturday&#39;s dissolution the constitutional endpoint of its mandate.</p>
<p>The transitional period has been characterized by escalating security challenges, with powerful gangs controlling an estimated 80% of the capital Port-au-Prince and launching coordinated attacks on government institutions, police stations, and civilian neighborhoods. The council faced criticism for internal divisions, allegations of corruption, and its inability to restore basic security and services to Haiti&#39;s 11 million citizens. International observers have questioned whether the council&#39;s dissolution and handover to the prime minister represents genuine progress toward democratic governance or merely another chapter in Haiti&#39;s prolonged political instability.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Fils-Aime is expected to remain in power as the country prepares for the first general elections in a decade, though no firm date has been set due to security concerns and logistical challenges. The United States has maintained significant influence over Haiti&#39;s transitional arrangements, providing security assistance and diplomatic backing for the current leadership structure. The dissolution of the council marks a pivotal moment for Haiti, with the coming months likely to determine whether the country can chart a path toward stability and democratic renewal or faces further fragmentation and violence.</p>
<h3>3. Jimmy Lai Faces Sentencing in Hong Kong on National Security Charges</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hong Kong media tycoon and democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai will be sentenced on February 9 in a closely watched case, with the 78-year-old founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper facing potential life imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three High Court judges who oversaw Lai&#39;s high-profile trial are expected to hand down penalties on the 78-year-old defendant at 10am on Monday, February 9. Lai was found guilty in December 2025 of two charges of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces under a China-imposed national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material. The trial has been widely viewed as a test case for Hong Kong&#39;s national security legislation and the future of press freedom in the former British colony.</p>
<p>Global leaders, including United States President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have called for Lai&#39;s release, while rights groups say his trial is a death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong. Some countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have said the trial is politically motivated and demanded Lai&#39;s immediate release. The sentencing comes as part of a broader crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong following the massive pro-democracy protests of 2019-2020, with authorities using the national security law to prosecute activists, journalists, and opposition politicians.</p>
<p>The judges will also sentence six former senior executives of Lai&#39;s Apple Daily tabloid-style newspaper, three companies associated with the outlet, and two activists in addition to Lai. International human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings as a violation of fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong&#39;s Basic Law and international human rights conventions. The case has attracted unprecedented international attention, with observers noting that the outcome will signal how far Beijing is willing to go in reshaping Hong Kong&#39;s legal and political landscape to align with mainland Chinese governance models.</p>
<h3>4. US and Russia Close to Handshake Deal to Observe Expired Nuclear Treaty</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5-8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. and Russia are closing in on an informal agreement to continue observing the expiring New START arms control treaty beyond its February 5 expiration, with negotiators agreeing to observe the spirit of the treaty through a &quot;handshake&quot; deal as the first time in more than half a century looms without binding limits on strategic nuclear arsenals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New START treaty officially expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time since the early 1970s that there will be no legally binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces without another agreement being under negotiation. While the U.S. and Russian negotiators agreed to observe the spirit of New START, the parties have not formally signed an agreement to that effect, with one U.S. official cautioning that the agreement would have to be &quot;a handshake&quot; deal because an extension is technically not permissible by law.</p>
<p>The treaty capped the US and Russia each at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers, and up to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. It also established detailed transparency and verification mechanisms, including data exchanges, notifications, and on-site inspections that provided critical insight into each nation&#39;s nuclear capabilities. Russia suspended the treaty in early 2023 over Washington&#39;s support for Ukraine, though Moscow said it would still observe agreed upon restrictions.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a &quot;grave moment&quot; as the final US-Russia nuclear arms treaty expired, noting that for the first time in more than half a century, the world faces a situation without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two countries that possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons, or more than 10,500 warheads combined. President Trump has suggested that if New START expires, a &quot;better&quot; agreement could be negotiated and said that China should be included, though Beijing has consistently argued that it will not join formal arms control negotiations while its arsenal remains far smaller than those of the US and Russia.</p>
<h3>5. US Military Buildup in Middle East Reaches Largest Scale Since 2003 Iraq Invasion</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and its strike group deployed to the Middle East on January 26 as part of the largest U.S. military buildup in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with Trump administration envoys signaling military resolve to Iran aboard the carrier on February 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was deployed to the Middle East on January 26, 2026, with its strike group, including guided-missile destroyers, cruisers, support vessels, and surveillance aircraft. The USS Abraham Lincoln serves as a mobile airfield and the flagship vessel of the US Navy&#39;s Carrier Strike Group 3, an operational formation that includes several thousand personnel—likely between 6,000 and 7,000 sailors and marines. Middle East analysts say people close to President Trump believe he is likely to strike Iran, with discussions centered around the U.S. military buildup in the region being the largest since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>CENTCOM chief Admiral Brad Cooper, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, who are leading negotiations with Iran, boarded the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier on February 7 in an apparent signal of military resolve to Iran. The high-profile visit came as diplomatic talks between the U.S. and Iran continued in Oman regarding nuclear issues, with Iran&#39;s foreign minister describing the discussions as &quot;a good start&quot; while noting that decisions on further rounds of talks would be taken after consultation with Tehran.</p>
<p>On February 3, 2026, six IRGC Navy gunboats attempted to stop and seize a US tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, but the Stena Imperative tanker ignored their demands and continued toward the Arabian Sea under the escort of the USS McFaul (DDG 74). Moreover, a US F-35 fighter jet shot down an Iranian Shahed 139 drone approaching the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, marking a significant escalation in tensions. Concerns over potential military escalation have mounted, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warning that any confrontation could spark a wider regional war that could draw in multiple Middle Eastern nations and potentially trigger a global oil crisis.</p>
<h3>6. Vietnam&#39;s Internal Military Document Reveals Preparations for Potential US War</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An internal Vietnamese military document issued by the Navy under the Ministry of Defense shows Vietnam&#39;s military was taking steps to prepare for a possible American &quot;war of aggression&quot; and considered the United States a &quot;belligerent&quot; power, despite having elevated relations with Washington to the highest diplomatic level just a year earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The internal military document was issued by Vietnam&#39;s Navy under the Ministry of Defense on August 1, 2024, entitled &quot;The 2nd US Invasion Plan (357/KH-BTL),&quot; which was signed by Vice Admiral Tran Thanh Nghiem and certified by Rear Admiral Vu Van Nam. The document confirms a deep-seated fear of external forces fomenting an uprising against the Communist leadership in a so-called &quot;color revolution,&quot; like the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, or the 1986 Yellow Revolution in the Philippines.</p>
<p>While the document states that &quot;there is currently little risk of a war against Vietnam,&quot; it does note that &quot;due to the U.S.&#39;s belligerent nature, we need to be vigilant to prevent the U.S. and its allies from &#39;creating a pretext&#39; to launch a war of aggression against our country.&quot; The disclosure highlights what analysts describe as a dual-track approach in Vietnam&#39;s foreign policy: outward diplomatic engagement alongside persistent internal suspicion. A year after Vietnam elevated its relations with Washington to the highest diplomatic level, the revelation of military planning documents targeting potential American military action underscores the complexity of U.S.-Vietnam relations.</p>
<p>The document&#39;s existence became public through reports in early February 2026, sparking debate among regional security analysts about the implications for U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia. Analysts note that Vietnam&#39;s Communist Party leadership maintains deep-rooted concerns about Western influence on its political system, even as it pursues economic and security cooperation with the United States as a counterweight to Chinese regional dominance. The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-Asian relations, with the Trump administration seeking to strengthen security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region while navigating complex historical legacies and ideological differences with communist-governed states.</p>
<h3>7. Nigerian Gunmen Kill Three and Kidnap Catholic Priest in Kaduna State Attack</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gunmen killed three villagers and abducted 11 people, including a Catholic priest, during a predawn attack in northwest Nigeria on February 7, marking the latest in a cycle of violence that has surged in the conflict-battered north of the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The incident occurred in Karku community of Kauru Local Government Area in the early hours of Saturday at about 3:20 am (WAT), at the priest&#39;s residence. The abducted priest is Rev. Fr. Nathaniel Asuwaye of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Karku. Three residents lost their lives in the attack, named as Mr. Jacob Dan&#39;azumi, Mr. Maitala Kaura, and Alhaji Kusari. The assault was described as &quot;an act of invasion by a group of terrorists&quot; by Catholic officials and local authorities.</p>
<p>The attack is the latest in a cycle of violence that has surged in the conflict-battered north of Nigeria, where armed groups—including bandits, kidnappers, and jihadist militants—operate across multiple states with varying degrees of organization and ideological motivation. Northwest Nigeria has experienced a dramatic increase in kidnappings for ransom over the past several years, with criminal gangs targeting schools, churches, travelers, and individual households. The region&#39;s security crisis has been compounded by ethnic tensions, competition over scarce resources, and the proliferation of small arms.</p>
<p>Nigeria&#39;s security forces have struggled to contain the violence despite military operations and the designation of bandit groups as terrorists. Religious leaders have called for greater government action to protect vulnerable communities, with Catholic bishops expressing particular concern about attacks targeting clergy and worshippers. The kidnapping of priests has become increasingly common in Nigeria&#39;s northwest and north-central regions, with criminal groups viewing clergy as valuable targets for ransom demands, knowing that religious communities and international Catholic organizations may be willing to pay for their release.</p>
<h3>8. Amsterdam and Florence Ban Fossil Fuel Advertising in Public Spaces</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amsterdam and Florence became the latest cities to ban fossil fuel advertising in public spaces, with Amsterdam&#39;s city council passing a legally binding ban on January 22 that will prohibit advertising for air travel, cruises, petrol-powered cars, and meat products starting May 1, 2026, making it the first capital in the world to enact such comprehensive restrictions through local law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amsterdam city council approved a bid by green political party GroenLinks and animal welfare party Partij voor de Dieren to ban fossil fuel and meat adverts in public spaces and on the city&#39;s public transport network. The measure will prohibit advertising for air travel, cruises, and petrol-powered cars, with the official start date of the regulation set for May 1, 2026. Companies that go against the new law could face fines of between €20,000 and €100,000, with repeat offenders paying double the amount.</p>
<p>Florence followed suit in early February 2026, becoming the first Italian city to adopt a ban on fossil fuel advertising in public spaces in an 18-3 vote. A motion passed in Florence means it will soon become the first Italian city to ban fossil fuel advertising in public spaces, targeting ads for flights, cruises, fossil energy contracts, and cars. Both cities are part of a broader global trend, as over 50 cities, mostly European, have either restricted such ads in specific areas or tabled motions to introduce formal limitations.</p>
<p>Several Dutch municipalities, Stockholm, Edinburgh, and Sydney have banned fossil fuel advertising altogether, representing a growing movement among urban governments to use advertising regulations as a climate policy tool. Environmental advocates argue that fossil fuel advertising normalizes high-carbon lifestyles and undermines efforts to meet Paris Agreement climate targets, while industry groups contend that advertising bans represent government overreach and may violate commercial free speech protections. The Amsterdam and Florence decisions are likely to inspire similar efforts in other European cities, potentially creating a patchwork of local advertising restrictions that could complicate marketing campaigns for airlines, automotive companies, and energy providers across the continent.</p>
<h3>9. Munich Security Conference Set to Address Transatlantic Divisions and Global Security</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 13-15</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 62nd Munich Security Conference will take place from February 13 to 15, 2026, assembling more than 450 senior decision-makers to debate pressing issues of international security policy at a fundamental inflection point, with longstanding alliances called into question and mounting instability across the globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During its main conference in February, the MSC assembles more than 450 senior decision-makers as well as thought leaders from around the world, including heads of state, ministers, leading personalities of international and non-governmental organizations, high-ranking representatives from business, the media, academia, and civil society to debate pressing issues of international security policy. Topics addressed at the MSC 2026 will include European security and defense, the future of the transatlantic relationship, the revitalization of multilateralism, competing visions of the global order, regional conflicts, and the security implications of technological advances.</p>
<p>With longstanding alliances called into question, the rules-based international order eroding, and mounting instability and escalating conflicts across the globe, this year&#39;s Munich Security Conference takes place at a fundamental inflection point. The 2026 edition is expected to bring back echoes of 2025, when US Vice President JD Vance signaled the breakdown of the transatlantic consensus on the war in Ukraine and the conceptual abyss that separates the new Trump administration from European allies.</p>
<p>The MSC kick-off will take place on February 9, 2026, and the next Munich Security Report will be released ahead of the 62nd Munich Security Conference on the same day. European leaders are expected to use the forum to discuss strategies for managing relations with the Trump administration, coordinating responses to Russian aggression, addressing the challenges posed by China&#39;s rise, and strengthening European defense capabilities. The conference comes at a moment when traditional assumptions about American security commitments to Europe are being questioned, forcing European nations to contemplate greater strategic autonomy while navigating complex dependencies on U.S. military power and intelligence capabilities.</p>
<h3>10. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Halts Trading in China-Linked Ramp-and-Dump Stocks</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SEC has halted trading in suspected ramp-and-dump stocks with potential China links as SEC Chairman Paul Atkins launches a crackdown to protect U.S. investors, with the agency announcing enforcement actions against nearly a dozen Chinese companies showing &quot;indications of manipulative behavior.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has announced enforcement actions against stocks it suspects are involved in &quot;pump-and-dump&quot; or &quot;ramp-and-dump&quot; schemes tied to foreign-based companies, including entities with operations in China. Atkins noted that the problematic companies are &quot;small, kind of penny stocks on Nasdaq,&quot; particularly East Asian and China-related companies. The SEC has identified nearly a dozen Chinese companies that showed &quot;indications of manipulative behavior&quot; and involvement with &quot;ramp-and-dump&quot; schemes.</p>
<p>Atkins stated: &quot;We have really good folks who are monitoring the markets and looking at the data that we collect … and then we&#39;re taking steps to shut down the trading before investors can get hurt.&quot; The action represents part of Atkins&#39; broader effort to tighten SEC scrutiny of Chinese firms trading on U.S. exchanges, with the chairman saying the agency is reassessing exemptions for foreign private issuers, particularly Chinese firms operating in China but incorporated offshore.</p>
<p>The crackdown comes amid growing bipartisan pressure in Washington to address concerns about Chinese companies accessing U.S. capital markets without meeting the same disclosure and audit requirements as domestic firms. Congressional leaders have been pushing for stricter enforcement of existing rules and consideration of legislation that would mandate delisting of Chinese firms that fail to comply with U.S. auditing standards. The SEC&#39;s actions signal a shift toward more aggressive oversight of foreign issuers, particularly those from jurisdictions where regulatory cooperation has been limited or where national security concerns about financial flows have been raised by intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Salesforce and ServiceNow tumbled nearly 7% in a single session this week, pushing ServiceNow&#39;s year-to-date losses to 28% and Salesforce&#39;s 2026 decline to almost 26%. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund has plummeted about 20% so far in 2026, including a 6.5% drop during the first week of February. &quot;I could tell you in 25 years, this structural sell-off in software is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, highlighting the unprecedented nature of the sector&#39;s decline.</p>
<p>The most important reason for the sell-off is the ongoing fear that these companies will be disrupted by AI tools, especially those made by Anthropic. A selloff in global providers of data analytics, professional services, and software deepened after Anthropic launched plug-ins for the Claude Cowork agent on Friday—automating legal work like reviewing contracts, non-disclosure agreement triage, and compliance workflows. Investors fear that agentic AI capabilities could replace significant portions of the workflow automation, data management, and analytics services that have been the bread and butter of enterprise software companies.</p>
<p>Software stocks have also plunged because of their valuations, which surged in the past few years, with companies like Adobe and ServiceNow going through a valuation reset. Among the worst performers in software ETFs so far this year are Intuit, a maker of tax preparation software, and DocuSign, which handles PDFs and other documents, with both down more than 30% as investors question whether AI agents will replace their core offerings. The sector&#39;s struggles reflect a broader reckoning about which software companies can successfully integrate AI into their products versus those whose entire business models may be rendered obsolete by advancing AI capabilities.</p>
<h3>2. Tech-to-Value Rotation Accelerates as &quot;Old Economy&quot; Sectors Outperform AI Giants</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. stock market is witnessing a massive sector rotation as billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into &quot;Old Economy&quot; value sectors of basic materials, energy, and industrials, with small-cap value stocks up 5.94% in 2026 compared to large-cap growth at 2.80%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. stock market is currently witnessing a tectonic shift in capital allocation as the &quot;AI hype cycle&quot; of the early 2020s gives way to the &quot;Physical Reality&quot; of 2026, with a massive sector rotation seeing billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into &quot;Old Economy&quot; value sectors of Basic Materials, Energy, and Industrials. While it&#39;s only a few weeks into 2026, the latest data shows that the tables are turning in the stock market, with small-cap companies outpacing large caps in an early reversal of last year&#39;s dynamic.</p>
<p>There&#39;s ongoing internal rotation within the market—some sectors (energy, materials, industrials, staples) are strong, while tech, consumer discretionary, and real estate lag. Investment firm Asbury&#39;s SEAF model currently favors industrials, materials, and energy, emphasizing defensive and cyclical sectors. Additionally, XLP (staples/defensive stocks) has outperformed XLY (consumer discretionary) since January 7th, with staples outperforming discretionary by 19%, signaling investors are rotating into safer, more defensive positions.</p>
<p>The AI boom of 2023–2025 focused on the models; the rotation of 2026 is focused on the power, the metal, and the machinery, mirroring the post-Dotcom era where after the collapse of speculative tech, the market spent years rewarding the companies that built the physical internet and global trade routes. Several sectors hit fresh all-time highs this week, such as industrials, materials, energy, and consumer staples, representing a shift from the tech-dominated gains of previous years. Wall Street&#39;s rotation into value has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bust, with analysts warning that the parallels—while not exact—suggest investors are reassessing which companies have sustainable business models versus those built primarily on growth narratives.</p>
<h3>3. Nvidia Rebounds 8% as CEO Huang Declares AI Demand &quot;Sky High&quot; in CNBC Interview</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6-7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nvidia shares surged more than 8% on Friday, February 7, after CEO Jensen Huang appeared on CNBC&#39;s Squawk Box declaring that demand for AI is &quot;just incredibly high&quot; and describing the current moment as a definitive &quot;inflection point&quot; where AI shifts from experimental curiosity to fundamental utility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jensen Huang told CNBC that demand for AI is &quot;just incredibly high,&quot; stating that &quot;the demand for Blackwell and our upcoming Vera Rubin platform is sky-high as nations and corporations realize that compute power is the new natural resource.&quot; Huang described the current moment as a definitive &quot;inflection point,&quot; where AI is shifting from an experimental curiosity into a fundamental utility for every industry. Huang stated during the interview: &quot;We are witnessing the largest infrastructure buildout in human history.&quot;</p>
<p>Huang said that the level of AI expenditures is appropriate and sustainable, and that the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure will continue for seven to eight years. Regarding compute constraints, Huang noted: &quot;These guys are so compute-constrained, and demand is so incredibly great,&quot; referring to AI companies like Anthropic and OpenAI. Huang also defended the massive capital spending by hyperscalers, arguing that companies investing in AI infrastructure are making rational decisions that will pay off over the next decade.</p>
<p>Following the interview, shares of Nvidia surged more than 8%, contributing significantly to the broader market rally that propelled the Dow past the 50,000 milestone. The stock&#39;s performance helped provide a counterpoint to concerns about AI spending raised by Amazon and Alphabet&#39;s massive capex plans announced earlier in the week. Huang&#39;s bullish comments reassured investors that the AI infrastructure buildout has substantial runway remaining, supporting the thesis that semiconductor companies and infrastructure providers will continue to benefit even as questions mount about the returns for those doing the spending.</p>
<h3>4. Consumer Sentiment Rises as Inflation Expectations Fall to Lowest Level Since January 2025</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of Michigan&#39;s consumer sentiment index rose to 57.3 in February 2026, beating market expectations of 55, while year-ahead inflation expectations fell sharply to 3.5% from 4.0%—the lowest level since January 2025—though sentiment remained roughly 20% below its level from a year earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The University of Michigan&#39;s consumer sentiment index rose by 0.9 points to 57.3 in February 2026, marking a third consecutive monthly increase and beating market expectations of 55. However, sentiment remained roughly 20% below its level in January 2025, reflecting persistent consumer anxiety about the economic outlook. The gains were driven largely by consumers with significant stock holdings, while sentiment among households without equity exposure stagnated at depressed levels.</p>
<p>Year-ahead inflation expectations fell sharply to 3.5% from 4.0% in January, the lowest level since January 2025, representing a significant improvement in near-term inflation psychology. However, longer-term inflation expectations edged up for a second month to 3.4% from 3.3%, suggesting consumers remain concerned about sustained price pressures beyond the immediate term. Concerns over the erosion of household finances due to high prices and the risk of job losses remain widespread, particularly among lower- and middle-income households.</p>
<p>The decline in near-term inflation expectations provided a boost to market sentiment on Friday, contributing to the broad rally that saw the Dow cross 50,000 for the first time. Treasury yields moved lower on the report, as investors interpreted the combination of moderating inflation expectations and still-subdued consumer confidence as supportive of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in the year. However, the bifurcation in sentiment between stock-owning households and those without equity exposure underscores the uneven nature of the economic recovery and ongoing wealth inequality concerns.</p>
<h3>5. Treasury Yields Slide as Weak Jobs Data Raises Recession Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5-7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.198% and the 30-year Treasury yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4.852% as investors reacted to weaker labor market data, with initial jobless claims hitting 231,000—well above expectations—and job openings falling to the lowest level since September 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.198%, and the 30-year Treasury yield was more than 6 basis points lower at 4.852%, with yields moving lower as investors reacted to weaker labor market data. Initial jobless claims for the week ended January 31 came in at 231,000, increasing by 22,000 from the prior weekly period and well above the 212,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had expected, raising concerns about labor market deterioration.</p>
<p>Job openings in December dropped to 6.54 million from the downwardly revised 6.93 million seen in November, and that new figure is the lowest level for job openings since September 2020. Additionally, the ADP report for January showed that private companies added only 22,000 positions last month, less than the 37,000 increase in December, reflecting a lackluster job market. The run of weaker labor data reinforced bets on multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, with markets still pricing in a first reduction in June and a second potentially in September.</p>
<p>The weak employment data contributed to the broader market selloff earlier in the week, raising questions about the strength of the economic expansion. However, Friday&#39;s strong rally suggested that investors are viewing the softening labor market as increasing the likelihood of Fed rate cuts rather than signaling an imminent recession. The bond market&#39;s reaction reflects the delicate balancing act the Federal Reserve faces: labor market weakness that justifies rate cuts versus persistent inflation concerns that argue for maintaining restrictive monetary policy.</p>
<h3>6. Oil Prices Hold Near $60 as OPEC+ Maintains Cuts Through March Amid Oversupply Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent crude oil futures traded near $60.87 per barrel while WTI remained at $57.46 as OPEC+ agreed to maintain voluntary production cuts through March 2026, with the EIA forecasting Brent will average $56 per barrel in 2026—19% less than 2025—as global production exceeds demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brent Oil Futures expiring in March were nearly unchanged at $60.87 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $57.46 per barrel. The American Petroleum Institute reported a decline of 11.1 million barrels bringing stockpiles to 420.3 million barrels for the week ending February 4, representing a significant inventory drawdown that provided some support to prices.</p>
<p>The eight key member countries of the OPEC+ alliance, namely Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, met virtually on February 1 and agreed to maintain their current voluntary oil production cuts through March 2026. OPEC+ kept voluntary output cuts in place through March 2026 while reaffirming flexibility to adjust production levels in response to market conditions. The decision reflects the alliance&#39;s concern about weak demand growth and rising non-OPEC production, particularly from the United States and other non-member producers.</p>
<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts the Brent crude oil price will average $56 per barrel in 2026, 19% less than in 2025, as global oil production exceeds global oil demand, causing oil inventories to rise. The consensus among leading analysts is that the market will be oversupplied in 2026, with the IEA seeing an implied oversupply of 3.8 million barrels per day due to weak demand. Global liquid fuels production growth in 2026 is driven by crude oil production growth in OPEC+ and increased output from U.S. shale producers, despite the cartel&#39;s efforts to support prices through supply management.</p>
<h3>7. Trump Argentina Beef Import Expansion Sparks Cattle Industry Backlash</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on February 6 temporarily quadrupling imports of lean beef trimmings from Argentina under the U.S. tariff-rate quota, authorizing an 80,000 metric ton increase for 2026 to address supply shortages and ease consumer costs, drawing pushback from the cattle industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on February 6, 2026, temporarily quadrupling imports of lean beef trimmings from Argentina under the U.S. tariff-rate quota (TRQ). The proclamation authorizes an 80,000 metric ton increase in in-quota lean beef trimmings imports for 2026, which will be allocated entirely to Argentina. The additional beef will be distributed in four quarterly tranches of 20,000 metric tons each, beginning February 13, 2026, and continuing through the end of the year.</p>
<p>Trump expanded beef imports from Argentina by 80,000 metric tons in 2026 to address supply shortages and ease costs for consumers amid cattle crises. U.S. consumers have seen beef prices climb steadily in recent years, with ground beef reaching an average price of $6.69 per pound in December 2025, which was the highest level recorded since the 1980s. The administration framed the action as necessary to provide relief to American consumers facing historically high meat prices.</p>
<p>The announcement drew pushback from the nation&#39;s largest cattle industry group, which questioned whether increased imports would deliver the price relief the administration is promising. Industry representatives argued that the import expansion could depress domestic cattle prices and undermine American ranchers who are already struggling with drought conditions, high feed costs, and reduced herd sizes. The controversy highlights the tension between the administration&#39;s desire to address consumer inflation concerns and its support for domestic agricultural producers, with critics arguing that the policy prioritizes short-term price relief over long-term industry sustainability.</p>
<h3>8. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings on Weight Loss Drug Boom</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, exceeding analyst expectations as demand for blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars, with the pharmaceutical giant projecting 2026 revenue between $80 billion and $83 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue and 2026 guidance that blew past estimates, as demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, a year earlier, representing a 51% increase in earnings per share year-over-year.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly anticipates its 2026 revenue will come in between $80 billion and $83 billion, representing continued strong growth driven primarily by GLP-1 medications used for weight loss and diabetes management. The company also projects adjusted earnings to be between $33.50 and $35 per share for the year, significantly above Wall Street consensus estimates prior to the earnings release. The guidance reflects management&#39;s confidence that supply constraints that limited sales in 2025 have largely been resolved and that demand remains robust across both U.S. and international markets.</p>
<p>The blowout results underscore how weight loss drugs have become one of the most lucrative pharmaceutical categories in history, with Eli Lilly and competitor Novo Nordisk capturing the majority of a market that analysts project could exceed $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. The success of Zepbound (tirzepatide) for weight loss and Mounjaro for diabetes has transformed Eli Lilly&#39;s financial profile, with the drugs contributing tens of billions in annual revenue and driving the company&#39;s stock to record highs despite concerns about potential insurance coverage limitations and the long-term sustainability of premium pricing.</p>
<h3>9. Pfizer Beats Estimates Despite Declining COVID Revenue, Reaffirms Modest 2026 Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pfizer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped estimates even amid dwindling demand for its Covid products, with the company expecting 2026 revenue to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion—largely flat compared with 2025—as it navigates patent expirations and declining pandemic-related sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pfizer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped estimates even amid dwindling demand for its Covid products. For 2026 guidance, Pfizer expects 2026 adjusted profit to come in between $2.80 and $3 per share, and revenue to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. Those sales would largely be flat compared with 2025 revenue, representing a stark contrast to the company&#39;s pandemic-era growth trajectory when COVID-19 vaccines and treatments drove record revenues.</p>
<p>The company expects declining sales of its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid to fall by about $1.5 billion year over year to $5 billion in 2026. Pfizer also pointed to another roughly $1.5 billion year-over-year expected drop in sales due to certain products losing their market exclusivity, reflecting the ongoing challenge of patent cliffs facing large pharmaceutical companies. The dual headwinds of declining COVID revenues and patent expirations are forcing Pfizer to rely more heavily on newer products and its pipeline to drive future growth.</p>
<p>Despite the modest outlook, Pfizer&#39;s ability to beat fourth-quarter estimates provided some reassurance to investors that the company is successfully managing the transition away from COVID-driven revenues. The pharmaceutical giant is investing heavily in cancer drugs, obesity treatments, and other therapeutic areas to offset declining sales from older products. However, the flat revenue guidance for 2026 highlights the significant challenges Pfizer faces in returning to sustained growth after the extraordinary but temporary boost provided by pandemic-related products.</p>
<h3>10. Walmart CEO Transition Set for February as Retail Giant Maintains Strong Guidance</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1-2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon&#39;s retirement is scheduled for February 2026, with John Furner, the CEO of Walmart&#39;s U.S. business, set to succeed him on February 1 as the retail giant maintains expectations for full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1% despite consumer spending headwinds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CEO Doug McMillon&#39;s retirement is scheduled for February 2026, with John Furner, the CEO of Walmart&#39;s U.S. business, set to succeed him on February 1. The leadership transition comes as Walmart expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1%, up from its previous expectations of 3.75% to 4.75%, reflecting the company&#39;s continued strong performance in capturing market share across income demographics. The company expects its adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63, a slight raise from previous guidance.</p>
<p>Walmart beat Wall Street expectations in its most recent quarter with strong food and health sales driving 6% revenue growth to $179.5 billion. Online sales jumped 28%, marking the company&#39;s seventh straight quarter of more than 20% e-commerce growth and underscoring the success of Walmart&#39;s omnichannel strategy. The consumer landscape is increasingly prioritizing value and convenience, with Walmart&#39;s strategic investments in omnichannel capabilities and e-commerce positioning it as a dominant force capable of attracting a diverse customer base, including a notable influx of higher-income households seeking affordability.</p>
<p>However, there has been some moderation in spending in the low-income cohort, consistent with macro perspectives, and in October, the disparity in wage growth between income cohorts was as large as it&#39;s been in almost a decade. The bifurcation in consumer behavior—with higher-income consumers trading down to Walmart while lower-income consumers struggle—highlights the uneven economic recovery and the challenges facing many American households despite overall economic growth. The CEO transition at such a critical juncture underscores the importance of maintaining strategic continuity while adapting to evolving retail dynamics and competitive pressures from both traditional rivals and e-commerce competitors.</p>

<h3>1. New START Nuclear Treaty Expires, Ending Last US-Russia Arms Control Agreement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The landmark New START treaty officially expired on February 5, leaving the world&#39;s two largest nuclear superpowers without binding limits on strategic nuclear weapons for the first time in decades, as President Trump called for a &quot;new, improved and modernised&quot; replacement while UN Secretary-General warned of a &quot;grave moment&quot; for global security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treaty, which limited each nation to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 700 deployed delivery systems, could not be extended because it permitted only one five-year extension—which was exercised in 2021. Today, there are no negotiations underway, and none are even planned, leaving the arms control architecture that helped prevent nuclear escalation during the Cold War in ruins.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the expiration represents a critical juncture for international peace and security, as binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons fall away amid heightened global tensions. Without New START, arms control experts warn that both nations could hedge against uncertainty by expanding their arsenals over time, potentially triggering unrestricted nuclear competition not seen since the 1960s.</p>
<p>President Trump stated that &quot;we should have our nuclear experts work on a new, improved and modernised treaty,&quot; but provided no details on timeline or negotiating framework. Russia has repeatedly indicated it will not engage in arms control talks while the US supports Ukraine militarily, creating a diplomatic impasse that leaves the world entering uncharted territory without legally binding constraints on the arsenals that contain 90% of global nuclear weapons.</p>
<h3>2. United States Accuses China of Secret 2020 Nuclear Test, Presses for Trilateral Arms Treaty</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration accused China of conducting a secret nuclear explosive test in June 2020 and using &quot;decoupling&quot; techniques to hide it from international monitors, as Washington called for a new trilateral arms control agreement including Russia and China to replace the expired New START framework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Thomas DiNanno made the allegations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, stating that China sought to conceal the June 22, 2020 explosion by &quot;obfuscating the explosions&quot; through methods designed to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring. The timing of the accusation—just one day after New START expired—appeared calculated to build pressure for Beijing to join arms control negotiations.</p>
<p>However, the allegations faced immediate contradiction from international monitoring organizations. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization stated its system &quot;did not detect any event consistent with the characteristics of a nuclear weapon test explosion&quot; on June 22, 2020, with subsequent analyses not altering that determination. The discrepancy raised questions about US intelligence assessments and diplomatic strategy.</p>
<p>China&#39;s Embassy spokesperson rejected the allegations, stating that China &quot;follows a policy of &#39;no first use&#39; of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense, and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium.&quot; Beijing has repeatedly refused to participate in arms control negotiations, arguing that such treaties would unfairly constrain its military development and prevent it from achieving parity with the US and Russia, whose arsenals are roughly ten times larger than China&#39;s estimated 500 warheads.</p>
<h3>3. Congress Passes $50 Billion Foreign Aid Bill Despite Trump&#39;s Proposed 79% Cut</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress allocated $50 billion for foreign aid in fiscal year 2026—a 16% reduction from 2025 levels—rejecting the Trump administration&#39;s budget request for just $31 billion that would have represented a 79% cut when including proposed rescissions and cancellations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislation brings an end to most forms of traditional US civilian assistance and formally shutters the US Agency for International Development (USAID), redirecting tens of billions of dollars toward domestic priorities, border enforcement, and selected security commitments. The budget eliminates $6.2 billion in global health spending, $3.2 billion in humanitarian aid, and $1.6 billion in food assistance provisions that had been cornerstones of American development policy for decades.</p>
<p>In place of traditional development aid, the legislation creates the America First Opportunity Fund, a $2.9 billion program restricted to expenditures that directly advance US economic or national security interests. The shift represents a fundamental reorientation of American foreign policy away from soft power investments and toward transactional relationships focused on immediate strategic returns.</p>
<p>While Congress provided significantly more funding than the administration requested, the $50 billion still marks a dramatic retreat from the $58.8 billion allocated in fiscal year 2025. Development advocates warned that the cuts will undermine America&#39;s ability to compete with China&#39;s Belt and Road Initiative, damage relationships with developing nations, and create humanitarian crises that could ultimately require more expensive military interventions.</p>
<h3>4. Syrian Government and Kurdish SDF Implement Ceasefire Agreement in Al-Hasakah</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Syrian army moved into the northeastern city of Al-Hasakah under a US-backed ceasefire agreement with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, beginning a gradual integration process that could reshape the balance of power in northeastern Syria after years of autonomous Kurdish administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 30, the Syrian transitional government announced it had reached a comprehensive agreement with the SDF including a ceasefire, gradual military and administrative integration, deployment of Interior Ministry forces in Al-Hasakah and Qamishli, integration of local institutions into the state, guarantees of civil and educational rights for the Kurdish community, and the return of displaced persons. On February 2, General Security Service forces began deploying to implement the framework.</p>
<p>The United States hailed the agreement as a historic milestone toward unity and reconciliation after 14 years of war. The deal establishes a framework for incorporating SDF fighters into Syria&#39;s national army and police forces while integrating civilian institutions controlled by the group into the central government structure—a process that will test whether Damascus can accommodate Kurdish autonomy demands while asserting sovereignty.</p>
<p>The implementation comes as Turkey continues to pressure Kurdish forces along Syria&#39;s northern border, creating a complex three-way dynamic between Damascus, Ankara, and Washington. The outcome will significantly impact regional stability, the future of US military presence in eastern Syria, and the broader question of how post-civil war Syria manages its diverse ethnic and political factions.</p>
<h3>5. Pakistan Concludes Massive Balochistan Counterterrorism Operation, 216 Militants Killed</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pakistan&#39;s military concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1, a week-long counterterrorism campaign in Balochistan province that killed 216 militants of the Balochistan Liberation Army following coordinated attacks on security installations, a high-security prison, and civilian areas across the province.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The operation was launched on January 29 in response to BLA&#39;s &quot;Operation Herof 2.0,&quot; which involved armed assaults and suicide bombings targeting security installations, police stations, and civilian areas. Multiple attacks were attempted and carried out in Quetta, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kalat, Gwadar, Pasni, Tump, and Mastung. Around 31 civilians and 22 security personnel were also killed during the violence that triggered the military response.</p>
<p>Pakistani security forces stated that the 40-hour operation resulted in the deaths of 216 militants and insurgents, according to the Armed Forces&#39; media wing, the ISPR. The offensive included deployment of helicopters and drones to end the standoff with Baloch rebels, with the government accusing India of backing the separatist movement—claims that New Delhi has consistently denied.</p>
<p>The attacks and subsequent military operation were widely condemned by China, France, Turkey, the US Embassy, and the UN Security Council. The violence highlights the persistent insurgency in Pakistan&#39;s largest but least developed province, where separatist groups have waged a decades-long campaign for independence, citing exploitation of natural resources and political marginalization by the central government.</p>
<h3>6. Costa Rica Elects First Female President Since 2010 in First-Round Victory</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laura Fernández Delgado of the ruling Sovereign People&#39;s Party won Costa Rica&#39;s presidential election with 48.30% of the vote, exceeding the 40% threshold required to avoid a runoff and becoming the Central American nation&#39;s second female president after Laura Chinchilla (2010-2014).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The February 1 elections saw Fernández defeat Álvaro Ramos Chaves of the National Liberation Party and 18 other candidates in a contest that centered on security, economic growth, and the controversial legacy of outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves. Her party also secured a commanding majority in the Legislative Assembly with 31 of 57 seats, against the PLN&#39;s 17, giving her government significant power to implement its agenda.</p>
<p>Fernández will be sworn in on May 8, 2026, continuing the aggressive reorienting of Costa Rican politics started by her political sponsor President Chaves. Her victory reflects voter support for the PPSO&#39;s conservative populist platform, which emphasizes law enforcement, economic development, and a nationalist approach to foreign policy—a departure from Costa Rica&#39;s traditional moderate centrism.</p>
<p>The election took place amid heightened political tensions in Central America, with neighboring countries experiencing democratic backsliding and increased Chinese influence in the region. How Fernández balances relations between Washington and Beijing while managing domestic economic challenges will define her presidency and Costa Rica&#39;s role in a strategically contested region.</p>
<h3>7. Record Snowstorm Kills 45 in Japan, Self-Defense Forces Deploy for First Time in 21 Years</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japan deployed Self-Defense Forces to Aomori Prefecture for the first time in 21 years as record-breaking snowfall killed at least 45 people and injured over 500 since January 20, with many victims suffering fatal falls while attempting to clear snow from roofs or heart attacks from extreme physical exertion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The death toll varies across reports, with Japan&#39;s Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirming at least 30 deaths and 324 injuries as of early February, while more recent tallies exceed 45 fatalities and 500 injuries. Niigata Prefecture saw the highest death toll with 12 fatalities, followed by six deaths in Akita Prefecture and four in Aomori Prefecture, with most occurring when people attempted to remove accumulated snow from around their homes.</p>
<p>Many victims suffered sudden heart attacks due to extreme physical exhaustion during snow removal, while others died after slipping from building roofs or being buried by snow that slid from high places. The severity of the storm prompted the unprecedented military deployment to assist with snow removal and emergency operations in communities cut off by drifts exceeding three meters in some mountain valleys.</p>
<p>The snowfall represents one of the deadliest winter weather events in modern Japanese history, highlighting the vulnerability of rural and mountain communities to extreme weather despite Japan&#39;s advanced infrastructure and disaster preparedness systems. Climate scientists note that warming atmospheric patterns can paradoxically increase heavy snowfall events in some regions through enhanced moisture transport.</p>
<h3>8. Washington Post Lays Off One-Third of Newsroom, Eliminates Sports and Foreign Bureaus</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Washington Post laid off nearly 300 of its roughly 800 journalists—one-third of the newsroom—eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus, and books coverage in the most extensive cuts at the storied newspaper in years as owner Jeff Bezos restructures the organization amid sustained financial losses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Executive Editor Matt Murray announced the layoffs during a Zoom call with employees, stating that the changes are necessary after years of financial challenges. Murray noted that the media environment has evolved greatly, with search traffic that once helped the paper &quot;thrive&quot; now in decline due to the growth of artificial intelligence—organic search traffic has fallen by nearly half in the last three years alone.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging job losses primarily affected sports, books, and podcast units, with foreign desks also heavily impacted, along with cuts to business and national teams. The Washington Post Guild stated that the outlet&#39;s workforce had shrunk by 400 people in the past three years, representing a wholesale transformation of one of America&#39;s most influential news organizations.</p>
<p>The layoffs mark the culmination of a difficult period for the Post that has included leadership turnover, controversial editorial decisions, and subscriber losses following the newspaper&#39;s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. The cuts reflect broader challenges facing legacy media as digital advertising revenues decline, subscription growth stagnates, and AI-powered search threatens to disintermediate news organizations from their audiences.</p>
<h3>9. Myanmar Junta Creates Union Consultative Council to Maintain Military Control After Elections</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myanmar&#39;s military leader Min Aung Hlaing signed the Union Consultative Council Law, creating a powerful new body that will provide &quot;guidance and coordination&quot; on security, foreign relations, and legislative matters—a mechanism analysts say allows him to retain decisive authority even if he does not directly hold the presidency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Union Consultative Council was formally proposed on February 3 after the conclusion of Myanmar&#39;s 2025-26 general election, which saw the military-backed party declared the winner in voting that ASEAN and international observers refused to recognize as legitimate. Under the new legislation, the council is formed by the president and must include a minimum of five members, including a chairperson and secretary.</p>
<p>Critics point out that the law&#39;s provisions effectively place the council above the president in influence but below the president in formal authority, creating a position—that of council chief—that could allow Min Aung Hlaing to consolidate power around himself even in a nominal civilian government. The structure mirrors arrangements used by military regimes to maintain control while creating a facade of democratic governance.</p>
<p>The new consultative council law is widely interpreted as a pre-emptive move to ensure military dominance as Myanmar remains mired in civil war nearly five years after the February 2021 coup. Resistance forces control significant territory across the country, the economy has collapsed, and international isolation has deepened—yet the junta shows no signs of relinquishing power or engaging in meaningful political dialogue.</p>
<h3>10. Storm Leonardo Kills Two, Forces 11,000 Evacuations Across Spain and Portugal</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storm Leonardo battered the Iberian Peninsula with more than 40 centimeters of rain in 24 hours, killing at least two people—one in Portugal and one in Spain—and forcing more than 11,000 residents to evacuate their homes as emergency services dealt with over 3,300 incidents including flooding, falling trees, and landslides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A man in his 60s was killed after being swept away by floodwaters while attempting to drive across a flooded area in southeastern Portugal. In southern Spain&#39;s Malaga province, a girl remains missing after being dragged away by the Turvilla River in Sayalonga while trying to rescue her dog. Emergency responders continue search operations despite dangerous conditions and receding floodwaters complicating recovery efforts.</p>
<p>The storm brought added hardship for Portugal, which was still reeling from Storm Kristin the previous week, which killed at least five people, injured hundreds, and cut off tens of thousands from the power grid. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro estimated damage from the consecutive storms exceeded four billion euros ($4.7 billion), putting enormous strain on emergency services and disaster relief budgets.</p>
<p>Portugal extended its state of emergency amid the destruction brought by Storm Leonardo, with meteorologists warning that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events. The back-to-back storms overwhelmed drainage systems, triggered devastating mudslides, and demonstrated the vulnerability of Mediterranean infrastructure to intensifying Atlantic storm systems.</p>
<h3>11. Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard Seizes Two Oil Tankers in Persian Gulf Over Fuel Smuggling</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard Navy seized two foreign oil tankers carrying approximately 1 million liters of fuel near Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf, detaining 15 crew members on fuel smuggling charges just one day before scheduled high-level nuclear talks with the United States in Muscat, Oman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tankers were carrying about 6,300 barrels of fuel including diesel and were transferred to Bushehr after being seized on Thursday. Iranian authorities did not provide the nationality of the tankers or specify what flags they were flying, nor did they disclose the nationalities of the 15 crew members taken into custody by judicial bodies for investigation.</p>
<p>The seizure comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington following Iran&#39;s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests and the Trump administration&#39;s deployment of significant military forces to the region. Iran occasionally seizes oil-carrying vessels in the Persian Gulf over smuggling charges, though the timing—just before nuclear negotiations—appeared designed to demonstrate Iran&#39;s control over the strategic waterway.</p>
<p>The incident highlights the fragility of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate US-Iran tensions, with both sides engaging in shows of force even as they pursue negotiations. The Strait of Hormuz and surrounding waters remain one of the world&#39;s most critical energy chokepoints, with roughly one-fifth of global oil supply transiting the narrow passage, making any disruption a matter of international economic concern.</p>
<h3>12. Nigerian Forces Kill Senior Boko Haram Commander in Sambisa Forest Raid</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nigeria&#39;s military announced the death of Abu Khalid, described as Boko Haram&#39;s deputy leader in the Sambisa Forest, along with ten other militants during a Saturday night raid in the Kodunga area of Borno State, recovering weapons, food items, and medical supplies from the extremist group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Army spokesman Sani Uba identified Abu Khalid as a key figure within &quot;the terrorist hierarchy, coordinating operations and logistics in the Sambisa axis.&quot; The operation targeted a Boko Haram command post that had been used to plan attacks across northeastern Nigeria, where the Islamic extremist group has waged an insurgency since 2009 that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions.</p>
<p>The raid represents part of Nigeria&#39;s ongoing counterterrorism efforts in the Lake Chad Basin region, where Boko Haram and its Islamic State-affiliated splinter group ISWAP continue to mount attacks despite years of military pressure. The Sambisa Forest has served as a primary stronghold for the militants, providing dense vegetation cover and proximity to civilian populations that complicate military operations.</p>
<p>While Nigerian authorities have announced the deaths of senior Boko Haram commanders numerous times over the years, the group has demonstrated resilience through decentralized leadership and continued ability to recruit from marginalized communities. The killing of Abu Khalid, if confirmed, would represent a tactical victory but is unlikely to fundamentally alter the conflict dynamics without broader efforts to address the poverty, governance failures, and ethnic tensions that fuel the insurgency.</p>
<h3>13. Sudan Forces Break Two-Year Siege of Kadugli, Advance in South Kordofan</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sudanese Armed Forces announced they opened a road into Kadugli, breaking through an over two-year siege and achieving their second major advance in South Kordofan in as many weeks, as the brutal civil war between SAF and the Rapid Support Forces enters its third year with no diplomatic resolution in sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conflict continues to escalate across multiple frontlines as both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces seek to consolidate territorial control through ground operations, artillery shelling, heavy drone strikes, and aerial bombardments. The Kordofan region has emerged as a key epicenter of hostilities, while fighting persists in North Darfur and Sennar states.</p>
<p>On January 11, the SAF announced the official return of national institutions to the capital, Khartoum, after recapturing the city in March 2025 from RSF forces that had seized control in April 2023 when the conflict erupted. The government had relocated to Port Sudan following the outbreak of the war that has devastated Africa&#39;s third-largest nation.</p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis continues to worsen, with an estimated 33.7 million people—around two-thirds of Sudan&#39;s population—expected to need humanitarian assistance in 2026. More than 20 million require health assistance, while 21 million face acute food insecurity. Sudan represents the world&#39;s largest displacement crisis, with 13.6 million people uprooted—9.3 million internally displaced and 4.3 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Overcrowded conditions and disrupted services have fueled outbreaks of cholera, malaria, dengue, and measles across much of the country.</p>
<h3>14. Trump Cuts India Tariffs to 18% After Modi Pledges to Halt Russian Oil Purchases</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump announced he would slash US tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% and remove a separate 25% Russia-related duty after Prime Minister Modi pledged to stop buying Russian oil and committed to purchasing more than $500 billion worth of American energy, technology, agricultural, and other products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trade deal ended months of escalating tensions between the two countries, with the administration also rescinding punitive tariffs imposed over India&#39;s purchases of Russian oil that had stacked on top of reciprocal tariff rates. Indian markets surged on the announcement, with the Nifty 50 jumping nearly 5% and the rupee strengthening to 90.40—its best day since November 2022—as trade war fears eased dramatically.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Modi notably welcomed the reduced tariffs in a post on social media but did not mention cutting purchases of Russian oil, raising questions about the specifics of the agreement. Nevertheless, India has begun slowing oil purchases from Russia, with January imports around 1.2 million barrels per day and projections showing declines to about 1 million bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned that legally binding text has yet to materialize, and implementation details remain unclear. The 18% US tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors in the battle for American market access, but whether the deal can withstand political scrutiny in both countries—particularly regarding the Russian oil commitment and agricultural tariff eliminations—will determine its longevity and economic impact.</p>
<h3>15. European Central Bank Holds Rates at 2% for Fifth Consecutive Meeting Amid Uncertain Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank maintained its key policy rate at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, with policymakers emphasizing that inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move despite eurozone inflation cooling to 1.7% in January—below the ECB&#39;s 2% target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision comes amid heightened economic uncertainty, with ECB officials monitoring the euro&#39;s recent appreciation and its potential disinflationary effects on the economy. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll predicted the ECB would leave rates unchanged for the remainder of 2026, reflecting expectations that inflation will remain contained even as growth remains subdued.</p>
<p>The ECB&#39;s cautious stance contrasts with more aggressive rate-cutting cycles in some other major economies but aligns with the Bank of England, which also held rates at 3.75% in February by a narrow 5-4 vote. The close vote reflects divisions on the committee about when to begin cutting rates, with some policymakers concerned about persistent services inflation while others worry about weak economic growth across the eurozone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve held its policy rate at 3.5-3.75% in late January, with Chairman Powell emphasizing that economic activity remains solid and the balance of risks to the Fed&#39;s dual mandate is improving. The divergent monetary policy paths across major central banks reflect different inflation dynamics, labor market conditions, and growth trajectories as the global economy navigates the post-pandemic adjustment period.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Alphabet Projects $185 Billion AI Capex for 2026, Doubling Annual Investment</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&#39;s parent company reported record fourth-quarter earnings while announcing capital expenditure plans of $175-185 billion for 2026—more than double its $91.4 billion spend in 2025—marking the largest capital expenditure commitment ever announced by a technology company as CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the AI infrastructure investment is keeping him awake at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alphabet beat Wall Street expectations with Q4 2025 earnings per share of $2.82 versus $2.63 estimated and revenue of $113.83 billion versus $111.43 billion expected. Annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time, with net income growing 15% to $132.2 billion. Google Cloud revenues surged 48% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, driven by enterprise AI adoption and infrastructure services.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s Gemini AI app reached more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million in the previous quarter. Alphabet achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency gains, and improved utilization. Approximately 60% of Q4 capex was invested in servers, with 40% allocated to data centers and networking equipment.</p>
<p>Despite strong operational performance, shares traded relatively flat as investors weighed the enormous spending commitment against uncertain returns on AI infrastructure. The guidance implies Alphabet is betting hundreds of billions of dollars that AI will transform internet services, cloud computing, and advertising—a wager that could reshape the technology industry but carries significant execution risk if demand fails to materialize or competition erodes margins.</p>
<h3>2. Meta Surges 10% After Beating Expectations, Announces $115-135 Billion AI Spending Plan</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meta Platforms reported Q4 2025 earnings per share of $8.88—beating forecasts by 8.42%—and revenue of $59.9 billion representing 24% year-over-year growth, while announcing plans to spend $115-135 billion in capital expenditures for 2026 to build AI infrastructure, sending shares surging 10% in extended trading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta&#39;s advertising business generated $58.1 billion for the quarter, making up nearly 97% of total revenue, demonstrating continued dominance in digital advertising despite competition from TikTok and other platforms. Operating income reached $24.7 billion with a 41% margin, while net income hit $22.8 billion, reflecting the company&#39;s ability to monetize its massive user base across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.</p>
<p>For Q1 2026, Meta projected revenue between $53.5-56.5 billion, with full-year expenses estimated at $162-169 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized AI&#39;s transformative potential, noting that the company is planning significant investments in AI infrastructure and talent acquisition despite potential supply chain constraints limiting GPU availability from Nvidia and other chip manufacturers.</p>
<p>The results and guidance contrast sharply with broader tech sector volatility, positioning Meta as a winner in the AI infrastructure race as it builds capacity for both internal AI products and potential future monetization through AI-powered advertising, content recommendation, and business tools. The company&#39;s cash generation provides flexibility to invest aggressively while maintaining shareholder returns through its ongoing buyback program.</p>
<h3>3. Microsoft Stock Plunges 10% on Azure Growth Slowdown Despite Record Capital Spending</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft shares suffered their biggest single-day decline since 2020, falling 10% after reporting that Azure cloud growth slowed from 40% in Q1 to 39% in Q2, disappointing investors despite the company announcing record capital expenditures of $37.5 billion for the quarter—66% higher than the prior year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decline extended through the following trading days, with shares falling an additional 3.5% as analysts digested implications of slowing cloud growth amid surging AI infrastructure investment. Stifel downgraded the stock from buy to hold on February 5, warning that consensus expectations for 2027 &quot;are too optimistic&quot; given the gap between capex spending and revenue acceleration.</p>
<p>Azure growth is projected to decelerate further to 37-38% in fiscal Q3, forming a concerning trend for investors who had expected AI services to accelerate cloud revenue growth. CFO Amy Hood noted that about two-thirds of the $37.5 billion quarterly capex was spent on GPUs and CPUs to keep up with AI demand, raising questions about return on investment as infrastructure spending outpaces revenue growth.</p>
<p>The stock decline reflects growing investor skepticism about whether massive AI spending by hyperscale cloud providers will generate adequate returns, or if the industry is building excess capacity that could lead to price competition and margin compression. Microsoft&#39;s struggle to translate record AI investment into accelerating cloud growth has become a cautionary tale as the sector grapples with what some analysts call an &quot;AI infrastructure wall.&quot;</p>
<h3>4. Amazon Plummets 8% on $200 Billion AI Spending Forecast Despite Strong AWS Growth</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon shares tumbled 8% after the e-commerce and cloud giant reported Q4 earnings of $1.95 per share—narrowly missing the $1.97 consensus—and guided to capital expenditures potentially reaching $200 billion in 2026, more than double its 2025 spending, to build AI infrastructure for Amazon Web Services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the stock decline, AWS revenue grew robustly, maintaining its position as the market-leading cloud platform ahead of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The division continues to be Amazon&#39;s profit engine, generating operating margins significantly higher than the company&#39;s retail business, but the massive capex commitment raises questions about how long the AI spending surge can continue without more visible revenue acceleration.</p>
<p>The $200 billion guidance represents one of the largest capital investment programs in corporate history, rivaling or exceeding commitments from Alphabet and Meta as tech giants race to build the infrastructure necessary for training and deploying next-generation AI models. Approximately 60-70% of the spending will go toward securing GPU inventory from Nvidia, AMD, and potentially custom silicon from Amazon&#39;s own chip design teams.</p>
<p>Analysts questioned whether customer demand for AI services justifies the enormous infrastructure buildout, or whether hyperscalers are engaging in a prisoner&#39;s dilemma where none can afford to fall behind in capacity even if overall industry returns remain uncertain. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky defended the spending as necessary to meet &quot;significant cloud customer demand&quot; but acknowledged that near-term margin pressure is inevitable.</p>
<h3>5. S&amp;P 500 Earnings Growth Hits 13% in Q4 2025, Tenth Consecutive Quarter of Expansion</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corporate America reported blended earnings growth of 13.0% for the fourth quarter of 2025, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of annual earnings expansion and the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth, as 76% of companies reporting beat analyst expectations despite macroeconomic headwinds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With 59% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported Q4 results, companies are delivering earnings that are 7.6% above estimates in aggregate, demonstrating continued resilience in corporate profitability. Ten sectors are reporting year-over-year revenue growth, led by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Health Care sectors, with technology sector earnings exploding 25% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts are projecting earnings growth rates of 11.3% for Q1 2026 and 14.9% for Q2 2026, with full calendar year 2026 expected to deliver 14.1% earnings expansion. The optimistic forecasts reflect expectations that AI-driven productivity gains, moderating inflation, and potential interest rate cuts will support profit margins even as revenue growth faces tougher comparisons.</p>
<p>However, the earnings strength masks significant divergence between AI beneficiaries and the broader market. Technology giants investing heavily in AI infrastructure are reporting explosive revenue and profit growth, while traditional cyclical sectors face margin pressure from tariffs, wage inflation, and slowing global demand. The concentration of earnings growth in a handful of mega-cap stocks raises questions about the sustainability of market valuations if AI monetization disappoints.</p>
<h3>6. Gold Surges Past $5,500 to Record High as Safe-Haven Demand and Central Bank Buying Intensify</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-21.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gold reached a new all-time high of $5,555 per ounce, marking a 100% gain over the last twelve months, as escalating geopolitical uncertainty, Federal Reserve independence concerns, and massive central bank purchases drive unprecedented safe-haven demand for the precious metal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spot gold increased to $5,501.18 per ounce, with February futures contracts exceeding $5,568 per unit. The rally reflects a fundamental repricing of gold as investors no longer view current prices as &quot;imminent crisis&quot; levels but rather as appropriate for &quot;a world of persistent instability, heavy debt burdens and eroding monetary trust,&quot; according to market strategists.</p>
<p>Global gold ETFs witnessed their strongest year of inflows on record in 2025, with annual inflows surging to $89 billion and global gold ETF assets doubling to $559 billion. Central bank purchases remained robust as nations diversify reserves away from dollar-denominated assets amid concerns about US fiscal sustainability and the weaponization of the dollar in geopolitical disputes.</p>
<p>A weakening US dollar has provided additional tailwind, making dollar-priced assets like gold more affordable for holders of other currencies. Additionally, a Trump administration criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has elevated safe-haven demand due to implications for central bank independence. Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale forecast gold reaching $6,000 per ounce by year-end as structural drivers remain intact.</p>
<h3>7. Emerging Markets Suffer Worst Week Since November as Global Risk Appetite Collapses</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-22.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emerging market stocks fell 1.4%—their steepest weekly drop since mid-December—as a global flight to safety drove investors out of developing-nation equities from record highs, with volatility spanning commodities and technology shares unsettling portfolio managers worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell as much as 1.5% on Friday before paring losses, while a similar measure tracking currencies showed mixed performance. Both gauges were poised for their steepest weekly drop since November, pulling a key index down from record highs reached in January as risk-off sentiment gripped global markets.</p>
<p>The selloff reflects multiple converging pressures: geopolitical tensions including US-Iran standoffs and the expiration of New START, uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy outlook, concerns about lofty technology valuations following massive AI capex announcements, and fears that tariff policies could disrupt global trade flows that many emerging economies depend upon.</p>
<p>Developing-nation central banks face a challenging environment as they balance domestic growth concerns against the need to defend currencies and control inflation. Countries with high dollar-denominated debt loads are particularly vulnerable if the risk-off sentiment persists, potentially forcing interest rate hikes that could trigger recessions in economies already struggling with weak external demand and capital outflow pressures.</p>
<h3>8. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings, Guides to $80-83 Billion Revenue on Weight Loss Drug Boom</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-23.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion or $7.39 per share, crushing Wall Street expectations, as blockbuster demand for weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro drives unprecedented revenue growth in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 drug category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pharmaceutical giant guided to 2026 revenue between $80-83 billion, dramatically exceeding analyst expectations of $77.62 billion, with adjusted earnings projected between $33.50-35 per share compared to consensus estimates of $33.23. The guidance implies continued market share gains against competitor Novo Nordisk, which has faced supply constraints limiting its ability to meet surging demand.</p>
<p>Production capacity investments are paying off, allowing Lilly to meet demand while Novo Nordisk struggles with shortages. The company&#39;s success reflects broader transformation in the pharmaceutical industry as GLP-1 drugs emerge as potentially the largest drug class in history, with applications expanding beyond obesity and diabetes into cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other conditions.</p>
<p>Clinical trials exploring new indications could expand the total addressable market well beyond current analyst models, potentially justifying Lilly&#39;s premium valuation despite shares trading at historically elevated price-to-earnings multiples. The company&#39;s execution in ramping production capacity faster than competitors has established a structural advantage that could persist for years as the global obesity epidemic drives sustained demand growth.</p>
<h3>9. Chipotle Stock Sinks 11% on Fourth Consecutive Quarter of Traffic Declines</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-24.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chipotle Mexican Grill shares fell as much as 11% in extended trading after reporting a fourth consecutive quarter of falling customer traffic and projecting flat same-store sales growth for 2026, signaling that the burrito chain&#39;s woes are not expected to disappear quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company posted adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share for Q4, slightly above the $0.24 consensus estimate, with revenue of $2.98 billion compared to expectations of $2.96 billion. However, traffic to Chipotle restaurants fell 3.2% and comparable restaurant sales declined 1.7%—the first annual same-store sales drop since 2016, alarming investors accustomed to consistent growth.</p>
<p>Executives noted pullback in spending from consumers of all income cohorts, although low-income diners have made the most significant shift in behavior. The 2026 outlook disappointed Wall Street as the company projected flat sales while analysts had forecast 1.8% growth, suggesting management sees limited near-term improvement in consumer spending patterns.</p>
<p>The traffic declines raise questions about whether Chipotle&#39;s premium pricing strategy has reached its limits, or whether broader economic pressures are forcing consumers to cut back on fast-casual dining. The company faces the dual challenge of maintaining value perception while protecting margins in an inflationary environment where ingredient costs, labor expenses, and occupancy charges continue to rise.</p>
<h3>10. Snowflake and OpenAI Announce $200 Million Partnership for Enterprise AI Integration</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-25.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowflake and OpenAI entered a multi-year, $200 million partnership that brings OpenAI frontier intelligence directly into Snowflake&#39;s data cloud, enabling the company&#39;s 12,600 enterprise customers to build AI applications and agents using their proprietary data without moving information outside Snowflake&#39;s governed environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the agreement, OpenAI models like GPT-5.2 will be available natively within Snowflake&#39;s AI Data Cloud across all three major cloud providers, allowing organizations to build custom applications and agents grounded in their enterprise data. Snowflake customers can use the models with tools like Snowflake Cortex AI to develop intelligent assistants, automated analytics, and AI-driven decision support tied directly to enterprise datasets.</p>
<p>The partnership is significant because it represents a direct, first-party integration of OpenAI&#39;s frontier models into Snowflake&#39;s platform rather than being mediated through a cloud provider like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud. This establishes deep technical integration that could provide performance and governance advantages over alternative architectures.</p>
<p>Analysts view the deal as strategic positioning in the enterprise AI race, where the battle is shifting from model development to production deployment at scale. Snowflake&#39;s emphasis on data governance and security—combined with OpenAI&#39;s leading language models—addresses enterprise concerns about deploying AI while maintaining control over proprietary information, intellectual property, and customer data.</p>
<h3>11. Producer Price Inflation Jumps 0.5% as Businesses Begin Passing Tariff Costs to Consumers</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-26.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Producer Price Index increased 0.5% in December—more than double the forecast of 0.2%—driven by a 0.7% surge in service prices, as businesses signal they are beginning to pass tariff costs down the supply chain after absorbing the majority of duties in 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Core goods PPI rose 0.4% in December, pointing to continued pass-through of tariffs into wholesale prices. JPMorgan estimates businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that proportion could flip to just 20% in 2026 as inventory stockpiles run out and price increases become unavoidable, setting the stage for renewed consumer inflation pressures.</p>
<p>The jump in wholesale prices fits into a wider trend of &quot;deglobalization inflation,&quot; where tariffs and supply chain domestication are raising the floor for prices across goods and services. With businesses passing more tariff costs to consumers, forecasters project US inflation rising to 2.7% in 2026 from current levels, complicating the Federal Reserve&#39;s efforts to return inflation to its 2% target.</p>
<p>Service sector price increases of 0.7%—the largest gain since July—suggest that inflation pressures are broadening beyond goods affected by tariffs. Wage growth, commercial real estate costs, and business services expenses are all contributing to wholesale price gains that will eventually flow through to consumer prices in industries from healthcare to hospitality.</p>
<h3>12. European Central Bank and Bank of England Hold Rates as Inflation Cools Below Targets</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-27.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank maintained its key policy rate at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting while the Bank of England held rates at 3.75% by a narrow 5-4 vote, as both institutions navigate slowing growth and below-target inflation amid uncertainty about economic trajectory and the impact of potential US tariffs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eurozone inflation cooled to 1.7% in January—below the ECB&#39;s 2% target—yet policymakers emphasized that inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant immediate rate cuts. Concerns about the euro&#39;s appreciation led some policymakers to monitor its potential disinflationary effects, while uncertainty about US trade policy creates additional complexity for monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p>Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the remainder of 2026, reflecting views that inflation will remain contained even as economic growth disappoints. The Bank of England&#39;s 5-4 vote reflects deeper divisions, with some members concerned about persistent services inflation while others worry about weak growth across major European economies.</p>
<p>The cautious approach from both central banks contrasts with expectations earlier in 2025 that aggressive rate cutting would be necessary to support growth. Resilient services inflation, tight labor markets, and uncertainty about fiscal policy in major economies have convinced policymakers to maintain restrictive policy despite below-target headline inflation and sluggish economic performance.</p>
<h3>13. Oil Prices Hold Near $63 as Iran Tensions Create Risk Premium Amid Oversupply Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-28.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude settled above $63 a barrel after a volatile week that saw prices whipsaw on US-Iran tensions, upcoming nuclear talks, and competing concerns about global oversupply as production surges from non-OPEC+ countries outpace demand growth projections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oil markets rallied earlier in the week on geopolitical risk premium following US military deployments to the Gulf and threats of strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but gave back gains as diplomatic talks scheduled in Muscat reduced immediate conflict probability. Iran&#39;s seizure of two oil tankers added modest upward pressure but failed to sustain momentum amid fundamental concerns about supply-demand balance.</p>
<p>OPEC+ extended production cuts through Q1 2026, attempting to support prices as surging output from Brazil, Argentina, Guyana, and US shale producers threatens to create oversupply conditions. Latin America&#39;s three emerging oil powers are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing Venezuela&#39;s recovery despite sanctions relief.</p>
<p>Energy analysts project crude prices will remain range-bound in the $60-70 range through mid-2026 barring major geopolitical shocks, with the balance between growing non-OPEC supply and uncertain global demand creating a cap on price appreciation. Chinese economic weakness, electric vehicle adoption acceleration, and efficiency gains in transportation continue to moderate long-term demand forecasts.</p>
<h3>14. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.11%, Lowest Level in Three Years, Spurring Housing Activity</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-29.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.11%—the lowest level since late 2022—driving a surge in purchase applications and refinance activity as the spring home-buying season approaches, with some lenders offering rates below 6% for well-qualified borrowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freddie Mac reported the 15-year fixed mortgage averaged 5.50%, while Morgan Stanley projects rates could decline to 5.75% later in 2026 if inflation continues moderating and the Federal Reserve signals openness to additional rate cuts. The decline creates opportunities for both first-time buyers entering the market and existing homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments.</p>
<p>Purchase and refinance applications have jumped year-over-year as lower rates improve affordability despite home prices remaining elevated in many markets. A surprising share of homeowners still carry mortgage rates above 5%, creating significant refinance demand as rates decline toward 6%. Housing industry experts note that activity &quot;is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season&quot; after two years of rate-driven headwinds.</p>
<p>However, affordability challenges persist in major metropolitan areas where inventory shortages and elevated prices offset the benefit of lower rates. The combination of pent-up buyer demand, falling rates, and limited housing stock could produce highly competitive spring markets with bidding wars returning in desirable locations, potentially preventing the price cooling that would make homeownership accessible to middle-income families.</p>
<h3>15. US Manufacturing Expands for First Time in 12 Months as New Orders and Production Surge</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-30.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ISM Manufacturing Index showed factory activity expanding in January for the first time in a year, with surges in new orders and production signaling potential economic resilience and ending the longest manufacturing contraction streak since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expansion reflects improved business confidence, easing supply chain pressures, and stabilizing demand conditions after months of inventory reduction and cautious ordering patterns. Transport stocks hit new all-time highs with the Dow Jones Transportation Average rising 2%, led by United Airlines, Old Dominion, and Delta Air Lines as investors positioned for strengthening economic activity.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs projects the US will substantially outperform global growth forecasts—estimating 2.6% GDP growth versus 2.0% consensus—due to reduced tariff drag, potential tax cuts, and easier financial conditions. The manufacturing rebound reinforces the bullish thesis that the economy can achieve a soft landing despite 18 months of restrictive Federal Reserve policy.</p>
<p>However, the sustainability of the manufacturing recovery remains uncertain given ongoing tariff threats, elevated interest rates relative to historical norms, and slowing global demand from major trading partners. Energy led January sector performance at 14.37%, followed by materials and consumer staples, while health care, information technology, and financials declined as investors rotated toward defensive positioning amid geopolitical turbulence.</p>

<h2>Fusion Energy</h2>
<h3>China&#39;s EAST Tokamak Breaks Through Plasma Density Barrier - <em>Jan 1</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists achieve stable plasma operation beyond the Greenwald density limit, unlocking a critical path toward sustained fusion ignition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China&#39;s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) has successfully demonstrated stable plasma confinement at densities 1.6 times higher than the theoretical Greenwald limit—a ceiling that has constrained tokamak performance for decades. The breakthrough, published in Science Advances on January 1, 2026, represents one of the most significant advances in fusion physics in recent years and could reshape how future reactors are designed.</p>
<p>For decades, pushing plasma density beyond the Greenwald limit typically triggered violent disruptions that damage reactor walls and terminate fusion reactions. EAST researchers discovered that by carefully controlling plasma-wall interactions during startup—specifically by optimizing fuel gas pressure and applying electron cyclotron resonance heating—they could minimize impurity buildup and energy losses. This allows the plasma to enter what theorists call a &quot;density-free regime,&quot; where the usual ceiling no longer applies.</p>
<p>The implications extend far beyond EAST itself. ITER, SPARC, and other next-generation reactors aim to achieve sustained fusion ignition, which requires maintaining extremely high plasma densities. If this approach can be replicated across different reactor designs, it could accelerate timelines for commercial fusion power by allowing reactors to operate closer to optimal conditions without fear of catastrophic instabilities. Researchers at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and other institutions are now working to validate these findings on spherical tokamaks and conventional designs.</p>
<h3>Commonwealth Fusion Systems Completes First SPARC Magnet Installation - <em>Jan 7</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>CFS achieves critical construction milestone as first toroidal field magnet is placed on assembly jig, keeping 2027 net energy target on track.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems reached a pivotal construction milestone in early January 2026 when the first of 18 massive toroidal field magnets was completed and placed onto the assembly jig inside the building housing SPARC, the company&#39;s demonstration tokamak in Devens, Massachusetts. The milestone marks the transition from component manufacturing to full-scale reactor assembly, with company officials describing the process as &quot;a complicated Lego set, but we have a good set of instructions and a good set of people that will put it together.&quot;</p>
<p>SPARC&#39;s magnets represent a technological leap enabled by high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape made from yttrium barium copper oxide. Unlike conventional superconductors that require cooling to near absolute zero, HTS magnets can generate enormous magnetic fields while operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 Kelvin), dramatically reducing cooling costs and system complexity. Each toroidal field magnet is designed to generate field strengths exceeding 12 Tesla, enabling SPARC&#39;s compact size while achieving plasma conditions previously possible only in massive reactors like ITER.</p>
<p>The assembly timeline calls for SPARC to be nearly complete by the end of 2026, with first plasma scheduled for 2027. The reactor is designed to produce at least twice as much fusion energy as it consumes to heat the plasma, achieving a fusion gain (Q) of approximately 11. If successful, SPARC will be the first net-energy fusion device using magnetic confinement and will pave the way for ARC, CFS&#39;s first commercial 400-megawatt fusion power plant planned for Richmond, Virginia in the early 2030s. That facility would provide enough electricity to power approximately 300,000 homes.</p>
<h3>National Ignition Facility Achieves Target Gain Record of 4.13 - <em>Apr 7, 2025</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Laser fusion experiment produces 8.6 megajoules of energy from 2.08 megajoules input, marking highest energy gain yet achieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory set a new world record on April 7, 2025, when a laser fusion shot achieved a target gain of 4.13—producing 8.6 megajoules of fusion energy from 2.08 megajoules of laser energy delivered to the target. This surpasses all previous inertial confinement fusion experiments and demonstrates continued progress toward the conditions needed for a fusion power plant based on laser ignition.</p>
<p>In NIF&#39;s indirect drive approach, 192 high-powered laser beams converge on a centimeter-sized cylindrical container called a hohlraum, which holds a peppercorn-sized fuel capsule at its center. The lasers heat the hohlraum&#39;s interior walls, generating an intense bath of X-rays that compress and heat the fuel capsule to temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius—conditions found at the cores of stars. When compression is symmetrical and timing is precise, the fuel undergoes fusion, releasing far more energy than was required to trigger the reaction.</p>
<p>While NIF&#39;s December 2022 experiment marked the first time a fusion reaction produced more energy than the lasers delivered to the target, subsequent shots have steadily improved both energy yield and target gain. The April 2025 shot&#39;s 4.13 gain factor represents a 70% improvement over earlier results and provides crucial data for companies like Focused Energy and other startups pursuing laser-based fusion power plants. However, significant engineering challenges remain: NIF&#39;s lasers require approximately 300 megajoules of electrical energy to produce the 2.08 megajoules delivered to the target, meaning overall plant efficiency must improve dramatically before laser fusion becomes commercially viable.</p>
<h3>Helion Energy Breaks Ground on 50-Megawatt Fusion Plant - <em>Jul 30, 2025</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Helion begins construction of world&#39;s first commercial fusion power plant in Washington, with Microsoft as anchor customer for 2028 delivery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Helion Energy broke ground in July 2025 on what it calls the world&#39;s first commercial fusion power plant, a 50-megawatt facility to be built on property owned by the Public Utility District near Malaga, Washington. The plant is designed to supply electricity to nearby Microsoft data centers by 2028 under the world&#39;s first fusion power purchase agreement, announced in 2023. If Helion meets its timeline, this would make it the first private fusion company to deliver commercial electricity to the grid.</p>
<p>Helion&#39;s approach differs fundamentally from magnetic tokamaks and laser inertial confinement. The company&#39;s seventh-generation prototype, Polaris, uses pulsed magnetic fields to compress plasma into a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC)—a doughnut-shaped plasma ring with no central conductor. Rather than sustaining plasma continuously like a tokamak, Helion&#39;s system operates in rapid pulses, compressing deuterium-helium-3 fuel to fusion conditions and then extracting electricity directly through electromagnetic induction, similar to regenerative braking in electric vehicles. This eliminates the need for steam turbines and dramatically simplifies the power conversion process.</p>
<p>As of early 2026, Polaris has successfully formed the largest FRC plasmas Helion has ever created, but the company has not yet announced achieving net electricity production—a milestone originally targeted for 2024 and later revised to late 2025. Skeptics question whether Helion can meet its aggressive 2028 commercial operation timeline given the technical challenges that remain. However, Constellation Energy has signed on as the power marketer for the project, and site work is progressing on schedule, suggesting confidence among key stakeholders that Helion&#39;s approach has merit.</p>
<h3>France Completes Final ITER Central Solenoid Module Installation - <em>Sep 2025</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>World&#39;s most powerful magnet arrives at ITER site as international megaproject inches toward first plasma in 2035.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sixth and final module of ITER&#39;s central solenoid—the world&#39;s most powerful magnet—arrived in France in September 2025, marking the completion of a critical component manufactured by General Atomics in California. Each module stands 14 feet tall, weighs 250,000 pounds, and is composed of niobium-tin superconducting cable capable of generating magnetic fields of 13 Tesla. When all six modules are stacked and integrated, the complete central solenoid will stand nearly 60 feet tall and generate the pulsed magnetic field needed to initiate and sustain plasma current in ITER&#39;s tokamak.</p>
<p>ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, is a multinational collaboration involving the European Union, United States, Russia, China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Located in southern France, ITER is designed to produce 500 megawatts of fusion power from 50 megawatts of heating input—a tenfold energy gain. However, ITER will not generate electricity; instead, it will demonstrate sustained fusion burn and test technologies needed for DEMO, Europe&#39;s planned demonstration fusion power plant.</p>
<p>Despite this milestone, ITER continues to face significant delays and cost overruns. The project&#39;s first plasma target has slipped from an original estimate of 2016 to a current projection of 2035, while total costs have ballooned to over $25 billion. Critics argue that ITER&#39;s scale and complexity make it ill-suited to the fast-paced environment of fusion energy development, where private companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems aim to achieve net energy years before ITER&#39;s completion. Nevertheless, ITER&#39;s research will provide invaluable data on plasma physics, materials science, and reactor engineering that will benefit all future fusion projects, justifying the international investment in this unprecedented scientific collaboration.</p>

<h3>First Infant Receives Personalized CRISPR Therapy for Urea Cycle Disorder - <em>Feb 2025</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Customized base-editing treatment for severe genetic disease marks milestone in precision medicine and offers template for treating rare conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February 2025, an infant diagnosed with severe carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency became the first person in the world to receive a customized CRISPR base-editing therapy created specifically for his unique genetic mutation. The patient, treated by a team at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, had been diagnosed with CPS1 deficiency—a disease with an estimated 50% mortality rate in early infancy. In the seven weeks following the initial infusion, the patient tolerated increased dietary protein and required only half the starting dose of nitrogen-scavenger medication.</p>
<p>CPS1 deficiency is one of several urea cycle disorders that prevent the body from properly eliminating ammonia, a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism. Left untreated, ammonia accumulates to dangerous levels in the bloodstream, causing brain damage, coma, and death. Traditional treatments are limited to strict dietary restrictions and medications that help eliminate ammonia through alternative pathways, but these approaches only manage symptoms rather than addressing the underlying genetic cause.</p>
<p>The therapy uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver a base editor—a modified CRISPR system that can change a single DNA letter without cutting both strands of the double helix. This approach is safer than conventional CRISPR because it minimizes the risk of unintended edits or chromosomal rearrangements. The team designed the therapy in just six months, demonstrating that bespoke gene editing treatments can be developed rapidly for patients with ultra-rare genetic disorders. Researchers now plan to launch a clinical trial in 2026 enrolling patients with any of seven different urea cycle disorders, with FDA approval potentially requiring as few as 5-10 successful treatments.</p>
<h3>FDA Clears New Regulatory Pathway for Bespoke Gene Editing Therapies - <em>Feb 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Plausible Mechanism&quot; framework aims to accelerate approval of personalized treatments for rare diseases with limited patient populations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February 2026, the FDA unveiled a new regulatory framework called the &quot;Plausible Mechanism&quot; pathway designed to accelerate the approval of personalized gene editing therapies for rare diseases. Under this approach, therapies that demonstrate a scientifically sound mechanism of action and show preliminary safety and efficacy in a small number of patients could receive conditional approval without requiring large-scale clinical trials—an impossibility for ultra-rare conditions affecting only a handful of individuals.</p>
<p>The pathway was developed in response to the successful treatment of infant KJ Muldoon with a customized CRISPR base editor for CPS1 deficiency. FDA Acting Commissioner Marty Makary and oncologist Vinay Prasad announced the framework after a productive meeting with YouthBio Therapeutics regarding its Alzheimer&#39;s gene therapy, stating that the new pathway would &quot;transform how we think about treating one-of-a-kind genetic diseases.&quot; The framework requires sponsors to demonstrate that the proposed therapy has a biologically plausible mechanism for correcting the genetic defect, provide preclinical data from animal models or in vitro studies, and show preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy in a limited number of patients.</p>
<p>Critics caution that lowering evidentiary standards could expose patients to unproven treatments, but proponents argue that for patients facing otherwise fatal conditions, the status quo—in which drug development economics make rare disease treatments financially unviable—is itself unacceptable. The pathway builds on the FDA&#39;s existing accelerated approval mechanisms but goes further by explicitly acknowledging that for diseases affecting only one or a few dozen people worldwide, traditional randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This regulatory innovation could unlock treatments for thousands of ultra-rare genetic conditions that currently have no therapeutic options.</p>
<h3>CRISPR Base Editor Safety Tool CHANGE-seq-BE Detects Off-Target Edits - <em>Jan 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Jude researchers develop sensitive method to identify unintended DNA changes from base editors, addressing key safety concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers at St. Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital have developed CHANGE-seq-BE, an unbiased, sensitive, and resource-efficient method to detect off-target edits caused by CRISPR base editors. Published in Nature Biotechnology in January 2026, the technique addresses a critical safety concern as base editors move from laboratory research into clinical trials for treating genetic diseases. While base editors are generally safer than conventional CRISPR-Cas9 because they change single DNA letters without cutting both strands of the double helix, they can still occasionally edit unintended sites in the genome.</p>
<p>Base editors work by fusing a catalytically impaired Cas9 protein to a deaminase enzyme that chemically converts one DNA base to another—either cytosine to uracil (which cells read as thymine) or adenine to inosine (which cells read as guanine). This allows precise correction of point mutations responsible for many genetic diseases. However, the deaminase enzyme can sometimes act on DNA sequences similar to the intended target, or even on sites where the guide RNA partially matches, creating unintended mutations that could potentially cause cancer or other problems.</p>
<p>CHANGE-seq-BE adapts an earlier off-target detection method to specifically capture sites where base editors have made unintended changes. The technique uses circularized DNA and high-throughput sequencing to identify all genomic locations where editing has occurred, providing a comprehensive map of on- and off-target activity. This allows researchers to test different guide RNAs and base editor variants to minimize off-target effects before advancing therapies to human trials. As dozens of base editor clinical trials advance through early-phase testing, tools like CHANGE-seq-BE will be essential for ensuring patient safety and building confidence in this promising class of gene editing therapies.</p>
<h3>AI-Designed CRISPR Editors Successfully Edit Human Genome - <em>Jan 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Large language models trained on genomic data create novel gene editors with improved precision and efficiency for therapeutic applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists have successfully designed and tested new CRISPR gene editors using artificial intelligence trained on vast genomic datasets, marking a significant milestone in the convergence of machine learning and gene editing technology. Published in Nature in January 2026, the research demonstrates that large language models can identify novel CRISPR systems with therapeutic potential by mining the explosion of genomic sequence data now available from environmental and metagenomic sources.</p>
<p>The research team curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons by systematically mining 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes—roughly equivalent to analyzing the genomes of 8 billion people. They then trained a large language model to understand the sequence patterns, structural motifs, and functional relationships that define effective CRISPR systems. The AI model identified several novel CRISPR-Cas variants not previously characterized in laboratory settings, predicted their guide RNA requirements and target recognition sequences, and suggested modifications to improve their editing efficiency and specificity.</p>
<p>When tested in human cells, the AI-designed editors successfully cut DNA at intended target sites with precision comparable to or exceeding that of widely used Cas9 variants. Some of the novel editors showed improved specificity, making fewer off-target cuts than conventional systems. Others demonstrated the ability to edit genomic regions that are difficult to access with existing tools. The approach promises to dramatically accelerate the discovery of gene editing tools tailored to specific therapeutic applications—for example, editors optimized for particular cell types, or systems compact enough to fit within the payload constraints of adeno-associated virus vectors used for in vivo gene therapy.</p>
<h3>Voyager Therapeutics Advances Friedreich&#39;s Ataxia Gene Therapy to 2026 Clinical Trial - <em>Jan 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>AAV-based therapy aims to restore functional frataxin protein and normalize mitochondrial function in rare neurodegenerative disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voyager Therapeutics announced in January 2026 that it plans to begin clinical testing of its experimental gene therapy for Friedreich&#39;s ataxia (FA) later this year. FA is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which encodes frataxin—a protein essential for mitochondrial function. Patients with FA produce insufficient frataxin, leading to progressive damage to the nervous system, heart disease, and loss of coordination. Most patients require a wheelchair by their mid-20s, and life expectancy is significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Voyager&#39;s therapy uses an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver a functional copy of the FXN gene to cells throughout the body. The AAV capsid was specifically selected for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, enabling the therapy to reach neurons in the brain and spinal cord where frataxin is critically needed. Once inside cells, the delivered FXN gene produces functional frataxin protein, with the goal of normalizing mitochondrial function and halting or reversing disease progression.</p>
<p>Previous gene therapy attempts for FA have been limited by the challenge of efficiently transducing the central nervous system and achieving sustained frataxin expression at therapeutic levels. Voyager&#39;s preclinical studies demonstrated that its vector achieves broad distribution throughout the nervous system and produces frataxin levels sufficient to restore mitochondrial function in animal models. The planned Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety of the therapy and measure changes in frataxin levels, mitochondrial function, and clinical outcomes such as neurological function and cardiac health. With approximately 15,000 people living with FA in the United States and Europe, a successful gene therapy could transform outcomes for a disease that currently has no disease-modifying treatments.</p>

<h2>AI Advancements</h2>
<h3>DeepSeek R1 Open-Source Reasoning Model Matches OpenAI o1 Performance - <em>Jan 20</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese AI lab releases MIT-licensed reasoning model trained for $6 million, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model that achieves performance comparable to OpenAI&#39;s o1 on mathematics, coding, and complex reasoning tasks—while costing a fraction of the price to develop. DeepSeek claimed R1 was trained for approximately $6 million in compute, compared to OpenAI&#39;s reported expenditure exceeding $100 million for o1. The release sent shockwaves through the AI industry and triggered a reassessment of assumptions about the resources required to build frontier models.</p>
<p>Perhaps most remarkably, DeepSeek demonstrated that reasoning capabilities can emerge purely through reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning as a preliminary step. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a variant trained exclusively via RL, developed human-like problem-solving behaviors including breaking complex problems into steps, checking its work, and backtracking when initial approaches failed. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that AI reasoning requires extensive training on human-annotated chain-of-thought examples.</p>
<p>DeepSeek has open-sourced the model weights, training code, and evaluation tools under the MIT License, enabling commercial use without restrictions. By the end of January 2025, DeepSeek had overtaken ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on the Apple App Store in the United States. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang credited DeepSeek with &quot;activating a global shift towards open-source artificial intelligence,&quot; noting at CES 2026 that the Chinese model had &quot;caught the world by surprise.&quot; The release accelerated efforts by Western AI labs to release competitive open models, with Meta, Mistral AI, and others announcing new open-source reasoning models in response.</p>
<h3>Anthropic Releases Claude 5 with Extended Reasoning and Multi-System Coordination - <em>Feb 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Latest Claude model features sustained thinking for complex problems and ability to orchestrate tools across platforms for weeks-long projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anthropic is expected to release Claude 5 in early February 2026, featuring significant improvements in sustained reasoning and multi-system coordination. Unlike previous models that process queries in isolation, Claude 5 is designed to maintain context across extended periods—managing long-term projects, coordinating tool usage across different platforms, and remembering decisions made weeks earlier. The model represents Anthropic&#39;s vision of AI moving beyond question-answering toward serving as a genuine collaborative work partner.</p>
<p>The extended reasoning capability allows Claude 5 to &quot;think&quot; for prolonged periods when tackling complex problems, exploring multiple solution paths, identifying potential flaws in its reasoning, and revising its approach iteratively. This sustained deliberation is made more efficient through architectural improvements that reduce the computational cost of extended inference, making it practical for everyday use rather than reserved only for the most difficult problems. Anthropic demonstrated Claude 5 analyzing multi-week research projects, identifying gaps in methodology, suggesting alternative experimental designs, and tracking progress toward research objectives.</p>
<p>Claude 5&#39;s multi-system coordination enables it to manage workflows spanning multiple applications and platforms. For example, when asked to plan a conference, Claude 5 can draft an agenda, research venue options, coordinate scheduling across participants&#39; calendars, send invitations, track RSVPs, and adjust plans based on responses—all while maintaining consistency across tools and remembering constraints established at the project&#39;s outset. Anthropic positions Claude 5 as a step toward &quot;AI that works the way you do,&quot; capable of taking on responsibilities that currently require dedicated project managers or coordinators.</p>
<h3>Neuromorphic Computing Goes Mainstream with Intel Loihi 3 and IBM NorthPole - <em>Jan 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Brain-inspired chips deliver 1,000x power efficiency improvement for real-time AI, enabling multi-day autonomous robot operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intel&#39;s Loihi 3 and IBM&#39;s NorthPole neuromorphic processors reached full commercial production in early 2026, marking the arrival of brain-inspired computing in mainstream AI applications. Unlike conventional processors that execute instructions sequentially, neuromorphic chips mimic the structure and communication patterns of biological neural networks, with artificial neurons that fire asynchronously in response to input signals. This architecture proves dramatically more power-efficient than GPUs for certain AI workloads, particularly those involving real-time sensory processing and decision-making.</p>
<p>The ANYmal D Neuro, a quadruped inspection robot utilizing Intel&#39;s Loihi 3 chip, demonstrated 72 hours of continuous operation on a single battery charge—a ninefold improvement over previous GPU-powered versions of the same robot. The neuromorphic processor enables the robot to process camera and sensor data locally in real-time, adjusting its gait dynamically as it navigates complex terrain without requiring constant communication with cloud servers. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have both announced plans to integrate neuromorphic vision systems for autonomous vehicles, where sub-millisecond reaction times are essential for emergency braking and collision avoidance.</p>
<p>Intel&#39;s Hala Point system, deployed at Sandia National Laboratories, demonstrates the scalability of neuromorphic computing for large-scale applications. The system comprises 1.15 billion artificial neurons and achieves energy efficiency improvements of three orders of magnitude compared to conventional GPU-based systems for certain workloads. Researchers project that by 2030, neuromorphic supercomputers capable of simulating 86 billion neurons—equivalent to the human brain—will require only 20 megawatts of power, whereas a comparable GPU-based system would consume over 400 megawatts. This efficiency advantage positions neuromorphic computing as a key technology for edge AI, robotics, and applications where power consumption is a primary constraint.</p>
<h3>AI Drug Discovery Platform Delivers Record IND Filings for 2025 - <em>Jan 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine learning-driven pharmaceutical development sees highest single-year jump in clinical trial applications for AI-originated molecules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2025 marked a breakthrough year for AI-driven drug discovery, with the highest single-year increase in Investigational New Drug (IND) filings for molecules designed using machine learning platforms. Companies including Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, BenevolentAI, Absci, and Generate Biomedicines collectively filed more than a dozen INDs for AI-originated small molecules and biologics, concentrated primarily in oncology, fibrosis, autoimmune disorders, and rare diseases. The surge signals AI&#39;s graduation from experimental research tool to platform-scale engine for pharmaceutical innovation.</p>
<p>The progress builds on advances in protein structure prediction, particularly AlphaFold3 and its open-source competitor OpenFold3, which now accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of protein-ligand complexes, antibody-antigen interactions, and protein-DNA/RNA binding. These capabilities give medicinal chemists unprecedented insight into how candidate drugs will interact with their biological targets, dramatically accelerating lead optimization. Boltz-2, an open-source model from MIT and Recursion, delivers near physics-level accuracy for binding affinity predictions at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than traditional molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies are now integrating AI throughout the drug development pipeline. Through the AI Structural Biology Network, major pharma companies are collaborating to fine-tune foundation models using proprietary structural data via federated learning—allowing companies to benefit from shared knowledge without exposing confidential intellectual property. Early clinical results are promising: Insilico Medicine&#39;s INS018_055, an AI-designed drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, demonstrated encouraging safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in Phase I trials, while Recursion&#39;s AI-discovered cancer therapeutic advanced to Phase II. As these AI-originated molecules progress through clinical development, the industry watches closely to see whether AI&#39;s promise translates into approved therapies that reach patients.</p>
<h3>Enterprise AI Agents Enter Mainstream with 78% Fortune 500 Deployment - <em>Jan 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Autonomous AI systems move from pilot programs to production operations as companies implement governance frameworks for agentic AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enterprise adoption of AI agents accelerated dramatically in late 2025 and early 2026, with 78% of Fortune 500 companies now deploying autonomous AI systems in operational environments—up from 67% a year earlier. The shift from experimentation to production reflects maturing architectures, governance models, and orchestration platforms that enable companies to deploy AI agents without sacrificing control or accountability. Industry analysts project the agentic AI market will reach $89.6 billion in 2026, representing 215% year-over-year growth.</p>
<p>Unlike earlier generations of AI that required explicit instructions for every task, AI agents can autonomously pursue goals, break complex objectives into subtasks, invoke tools and APIs, and adapt their strategies based on feedback. Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, and other enterprise software vendors have embedded agentic capabilities into their platforms, enabling AI agents to coordinate workflows across sales, support, supply chain, and finance. Snowflake and OpenAI announced a $200 million partnership in February 2026 to accelerate deployment of agentic AI for corporate enterprises, integrating OpenAI&#39;s reasoning models into Snowflake&#39;s Data Cloud.</p>
<p>Leading organizations are implementing &quot;bounded autonomy&quot; architectures that define clear operational limits for AI agents, specify escalation paths to humans for high-stakes decisions, and maintain comprehensive audit trails of agent actions. JPMorgan Chase, for example, deployed an AI agent that autonomously monitors financial transactions for potential fraud, flags suspicious patterns, and generates preliminary investigation reports—but always routes final determinations through human compliance officers. This hybrid approach allows organizations to benefit from AI&#39;s speed and consistency while retaining human oversight for decisions with significant consequences. As enterprises gain confidence in these systems, the scope of autonomous agent authority is gradually expanding, with multi-agent systems beginning to coordinate complex cross-functional workflows previously requiring dedicated human project managers.</p>

<h1>Weekly Finance Briefing</h1>
<p><strong>Week of January 27 - February 2, 2026</strong></p>
<p><em>Research Generated: February 3, 2026, 11:45 AM PST</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Inflation &amp; Finance Metrics</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady in Split Decision Amid Political Pressure - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The FOMC voted 10-2 to keep interest rates at 3.50%-3.75%, ending a string of three consecutive quarter-point cuts as Chair Powell described the economy as on &quot;firm footing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, January 28, marking the central bank&#39;s first pause since July 2025. The decision came after three consecutive quarter-point reductions delivered between September and December 2025, which Powell characterized as having moved policy toward a &quot;neutral&quot; range. Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented from the decision, favoring continued cuts.</p>
<p>In his post-meeting press conference, Chair Jerome Powell stated that &quot;if you look at the incoming data since the last meeting, there is clear improvement in the outlook for growth. Inflation performed about as expected, and some of the labor market data came in suggesting evidence of stabilization.&quot; Powell noted there was &quot;broad support on the Committee for holding today,&quot; including among non-voting members, though some wanted to continue cutting.</p>
<p>Futures markets now expect at most two quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2026, with the first anticipated in June and a second in the fall, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The decision comes as President Trump announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would replace Powell when his term ends in May.</p>
<h3>Government Shutdown Delays Key January Jobs Report - <em>Feb 2, 10:30 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the January employment report will not be released as scheduled on February 6 after lawmakers failed to reach funding agreement following controversial DHS enforcement actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government partially shut down on January 31 after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding, an impasse sparked by outcry over the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota—specifically the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6.</p>
<p>In addition to the January jobs report, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) release for December 2025 and the Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for December 2025 will also be rescheduled. The BLS stated that &quot;due to the partial federal government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will suspend data collection, processing, and dissemination.&quot;</p>
<p>Signs from Capitol Hill suggest this shutdown will be brief—unlike the 43-day shutdown that concluded November 12. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he anticipates passing funding legislation early this week. Unlike in last year&#39;s shutdown, which resulted in major inflation and unemployment data going uncollected for October, the relevant data has already been collected. Economists had expected the January jobs report to show employers added 80,000 jobs last month, up from 50,000 in December.</p>
<h3>Tariff Costs Set to Hit Consumers Harder as Businesses Pass Along Price Increases - <em>Jan 30, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After absorbing roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, businesses are now passing those costs to consumers, with the figure expected to flip to just 20% business absorption later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump&#39;s tariffs are increasingly impacting consumer prices as businesses exhaust their pretariff inventory and begin passing costs to shoppers. According to JPMorgan analysis, businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that ratio could shrink to just 20% later this year as companies implement further price hikes. Goldman Sachs economists estimated that tariffs caused inflation to increase by half a percentage point in 2025.</p>
<p>According to NBER research, since President Trump announced broad tariff measures starting in the spring, the import taxes increased the inflation rate by 0.7 percentage points between March and August. The annual inflation rate for August—which was 2.9%—would have been 2.2% without tariffs. Before Trump took office, the U.S. average effective tariff rate was 2.4%, according to estimates from the Yale Budget Lab. At the end of 2025, it was 16.8%.</p>
<p>Consumer goods with the steepest price increases since Trump took office tend to be those with lower profit margins. Prices of heavily imported items—including tomatoes and coffee—have changed more significantly than most other goods. The United States collected $187 billion more in tariff revenue in 2025 than it did in 2024, a nearly 200% increase. According to Budget Lab research, tariffs represent an income loss of $1,700 for the average U.S. household.</p>
<h3>Warren Report: Households Paid $2,120 More Due to Inflation in 2025 - <em>Jan 30, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Warren&#39;s team found year-on-year inflation equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, with lower-income families facing costs exceeding 5% of their income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren released a report through the Senate Banking Committee detailing how households paid an estimated $2,120 more in 2025 because of inflation—including an estimated $123 more on electricity bills and an estimated $150 more for groceries. The year-on-year inflation increase equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, assuming they purchased the same goods and services in 2025 that they bought in 2024.</p>
<p>Higher prices have fallen hardest on those least able to afford them. In 2025, the bottom 20% of households faced roughly $950 in additional inflation-related costs—more than 5% of their estimated income. In contrast, although the top 20% paid more in absolute dollars, those costs amounted to just 2% of their estimated income. The report documents sharp price increases for everyday grocery staples, including coffee and beef prices, which are up a respective 29% and 21% since January 2025.</p>
<p>The report comes as the annual inflation rate in the United States was 2.7% for the 12 months ending December, according to U.S. Labor Department data released on January 13, 2026. While inflation is off its 40-year highs from 2022, the rate is still running closer to 3% than the Fed&#39;s 2% goal, causing concern among some FOMC officials who either want rate cuts paused or eliminated until there&#39;s more evidence that price increases are easing.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Case Threatens Fed Independence as Powell Calls It &quot;Most Important&quot; in 113 Years - <em>Jan 21, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments in the Lisa Cook case, while separately facing DOJ subpoenas over building renovations that he characterizes as &quot;pretexts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments on January 21 in a landmark case addressing whether President Donald Trump can fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell called the case &quot;perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed&#39;s 113-year history,&quot; adding that &quot;as I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn&#39;t attend.&quot; The case tests the legal boundaries of presidential power and the independence of the central bank.</p>
<p>Trump cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements in applying for home mortgages. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term. All three former living Fed chairs—Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen—signed on to a legal brief arguing against Cook&#39;s removal, along with a group of former Treasury secretaries and chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>The Trump administration also hit the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on January 9, initiating a criminal investigation into Powell for his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June regarding cost overruns at Federal Reserve building renovations. Powell stated: &quot;This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of federal reserve buildings. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.&quot;</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Developments</h2>
<h3>Bitcoin Crashes Below $75,000 in Weekend Bloodbath, Marking Fourth Consecutive Monthly Decline - <em>Feb 2, 9:15 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since April 2025, wiping roughly $800 billion in market value since its October peak and knocking it out of the global top 10 assets as leveraged long positions were liquidated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin plunged below $75,000 on Sunday, February 2, extending a drawdown that has wiped more than 30% off the value of the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency since its October 2025 peak of approximately $126,000. The move marked Bitcoin&#39;s lowest level since April 2025, when markets were rattled by U.S. tariff announcements. The drop capped Bitcoin&#39;s fourth consecutive monthly decline and its longest losing streak in seven years.</p>
<p>A confluence of factors drove the crash: President Trump&#39;s nomination of Kevin Warsh—a known monetary hawk—to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair landed as a shock to markets, immediately resetting expectations for rate cuts. The U.S. dollar surged, rate-cut odds for the first half of 2026 collapsed, and risk assets were repriced lower. Disappointing earnings from Magnificent Seven tech companies cracked the AI narrative, while a violent precious metals unwind added to risk-off sentiment.</p>
<p>Data from Glassnode confirms that Bitcoin fell below its True Market Mean—currently at $80,500—for the first time in 30 months. Historically, a breach of this level marks a switch from a bullish cycle to a medium-term bearish trend. Compass Point analysts say the crypto bear market is in its &quot;final innings,&quot; with bitcoin likely to bottom between $60,000 and $68,000 absent a broader U.S. equity bear market. They warn that the $70,000 to $80,000 range is an &quot;air pocket&quot; with little structural support.</p>
<h3>January 2026 Bitcoin ETF Outflows Hit $1.6 Billion as Institutional Appetite Evaporates - <em>Jan 31, 4:30 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted their worst month since launch with $1.61 billion in net outflows, while BlackRock&#39;s IBIT alone shed over $500 million in a single day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>January 2026 proved to be a brutal reset month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posting -$1.61 billion in net outflows for the month. Total monthly traded value reached $86.99 billion, with $106.96 billion in total net assets at month end. The ETF bid that underpinned Bitcoin through much of 2025 has effectively evaporated.</p>
<p>U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs suffered heavy redemptions on January 29, with nearly $1 billion yanked in a single session. Investors withdrew $817.9 million from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs on January 29, the largest daily outflow since November 20. BlackRock&#39;s IBIT bore the brunt of redemptions, shedding $317.8 million, while Fidelity&#39;s FBTC lost $168 million and Grayscale&#39;s GBTC saw $119.4 million exit.</p>
<p>The 11 spot ETFs cumulatively registered a net outflow of $1.09 billion in December after a much steeper $3.48 billion in November. That amounts to a combined two-month redemption worth $4.57 billion—the largest since their debut in January 2024. On the Ethereum side, January 30 showed net ETF flow of -$252.87 million, with $1.80 billion traded value and $15.86 billion total net assets.</p>
<h3>$2.5 Billion Liquidation Cascade Amplifies Crypto Downturn - <em>Jan 31, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Forced deleveraging triggered over $2.5 billion in liquidations in a single 24-hour period, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion as overleveraged traders were forced to close positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of forced selling was staggering, with more than $2 billion of bitcoin long and short positions liquidated since Thursday, January 30. This wasn&#39;t a gradual correction—it was a violent deleveraging wave that forced prices down sharply. Market structure evidence supports a liquidity and positioning driven move into month end.</p>
<p>In a single 24-hour period, $2.53 billion in futures liquidations occurred, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion. Ethereum was the hardest hit, accounting for nearly half of the total carnage with $1.14 billion in liquidations. Forced deleveraging acted as a direct transmission mechanism, with estimated 24-hour liquidations exceeding $1.7 billion around January 30, followed by an estimated $2.5 billion on January 31.</p>
<p>Bitcoin fell about 12% in the last seven days, wiping off more than $200 billion in market value and triggering over $2 billion in forced liquidations, creating a cascading effect that amplified the downturn. According to analysts, the outflows coincided with a broader risk-off sentiment driven by hawkish Fed expectations and geopolitical tensions, with ETF flows reacting to price weakness rather than leading it.</p>
<h3>Senate Agriculture Committee Advances Landmark Crypto Regulation Bill - <em>Jan 29, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In a historic first, a crypto market structure bill advanced beyond a Senate committee as the Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act passed on a 12-11 party-line vote, establishing CFTC regulatory authority over digital commodities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines on January 29 to advance its version of a cryptocurrency market structure bill, marking the first time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act advanced on a 12-11 vote with all Republicans voting &quot;yes&quot; and all Democrats voting &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislation would establish a clear legal definition of digital commodities and create a spot market digital commodity intermediary regulatory regime with the CFTC. It would also create consumer protections, including conflict of interest safeguards and customer disclosure requirements. The proposed bill grants regulatory authority to both the CFTC and the SEC and clarifies the jurisdictional scope between the two agencies—the CFTC would be granted explicit authority over spot market digital asset commodities, while the SEC would maintain authority over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract.</p>
<p>The crypto industry now has two permanent, crypto-friendly chairmen at the SEC and CFTC, with no Democratic pushback. Paul Atkins leads the SEC, while Trump nominee Mike Selig won confirmation late last month and was sworn in as CFTC chairman on December 22. The Senate Banking Committee would also need to approve its version of a crypto market structure bill before the two measures could combine and advance to the full Senate.</p>
<h3>Geopolitical Tensions and Iran Explosion Rattle Crypto Markets - <em>Feb 1, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A sharp escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, including an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port, triggered a wave of selling across crypto, gold, silver, and U.S. stock futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto markets extended their decline as geopolitical tensions escalated, with the selloff gathering pace following reports of an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port—a critical shipping hub on the Strait of Hormuz that handles about a fifth of the world&#39;s seaborne oil. Bitcoin fell sharply, sliding below the $80,000 mark to levels last seen in April 2025, while Ethereum hovered near $2,200 as a wave of liquidations hit leveraged positions during low-liquidity weekend trading.</p>
<p>For the first time, the United States has sanctioned crypto exchanges linked to Iran. This decision, announced at the end of January 2026, targets two British platforms accused of facilitating transactions for Iranian entities under embargo—specifically Zedex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd. for their alleged role in financing Iranian entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>Iran&#39;s crypto ecosystem reached over $7.78 billion in 2025, having grown at a notably faster pace compared to the year prior. Iran&#39;s crypto activity shows significant spikes corresponding to major domestic and geopolitical events. During Iran&#39;s recent protests and internet blackout from December 28, 2025 to January 8, 2026, there were substantial increases in both daily dollar amounts transacted and withdrawals from Iranian exchanges to personal Bitcoin wallets—suggesting Iranians are taking possession of Bitcoin at a markedly higher rate as a rational response to the collapse of the Iranian rial.</p>
