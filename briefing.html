<h3>1. US-Iran Nuclear Talks Conclude in Oman with Agreement to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States and Iran concluded indirect nuclear talks mediated by Oman in Muscat on Friday, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi calling the session &quot;a good start&quot; focused solely on the nuclear issue, as both sides agreed to hold follow-on discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met directly with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi during the day-long session, which ran from 10 AM to 6 PM local time with Oman serving as intermediary between the two delegations. The talks represented the first restart of nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Tehran since last summer&#39;s military strikes against Iran, and focused exclusively on Iran&#39;s nuclear program rather than broader regional issues, according to IRNA.</p>
<p>The talks took place against a backdrop of massive U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf, with President Trump warning he could pivot to military action if negotiations fail to produce results quickly. Prediction markets now price a U.S. strike on Iran by mid-February at 31%, rising to 44% by month&#39;s end. The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has driven strike odds higher, particularly after an F-35 from the carrier shot down an Iranian Shahed-139 drone on February 3 that &quot;aggressively approached&quot; the ship.</p>
<p>In a sign that Washington intends to maintain economic pressure alongside diplomacy, the administration announced new sanctions on the same day talks concluded, targeting 15 entities, two individuals, and 14 shadow fleet vessels linked to Iran&#39;s illicit oil trade. The inconclusive outcome — characterized as suspended &quot;for now&quot; rather than collapsed — leaves open the possibility of resumed negotiations, though the timeline remains unclear as both sides face significant domestic political constraints.</p>

<h3>2. Ukraine Peace Talks in Abu Dhabi Yield Prisoner Swap and Military Dialogue Agreement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two days of trilateral peace talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in Abu Dhabi produced a deal to exchange 314 prisoners of war — the first such swap since September — and an agreement to reestablish high-level U.S.-Russia military-to-military dialogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced Thursday that the talks had yielded concrete results, with both sides agreeing to the prisoner exchange and the restoration of direct military communication channels between Washington and Moscow. Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev said there was &quot;positive movement forward,&quot; while Ukraine&#39;s lead negotiator Rustem Umerov described the discussions as &quot;substantive and productive, focused on concrete steps and practical solutions.&quot;</p>
<p>The main sticking point remains the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine. Moscow demands Kyiv withdraw troops from all of the Donetsk region, including a line of heavily fortified cities regarded as one of Ukraine&#39;s strongest defenses. Ukraine insists the conflict should be frozen along the current front lines and rejects any unilateral pullback. President Zelensky revealed ahead of the talks that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, with a &quot;large number&quot; still officially missing — though independent estimates from CSIS place the toll between 100,000 and 140,000.</p>
<p>The talks mark a significant diplomatic milestone as the war approaches its fourth anniversary this month, with the fact that all three parties are engaging directly described as notable in itself. However, European allies have expressed concern about being excluded from the process, and the fundamental territorial disputes appear far from resolution. A third round of talks has not yet been formally announced.</p>

<h3>3. Islamabad Mosque Suicide Bombing Kills 31 in Deadliest Attack on Capital Since 2008</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A suicide bomber attacked the Khadija Tul Kubra Mosque, a Shia mosque in Islamabad&#39;s southeastern Tarlai Kalan neighborhood, during Friday congregational prayers, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 169 in the deadliest attack on Pakistan&#39;s capital since the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attacker was stopped at the mosque&#39;s entrance by security personnel before opening fire and detonating explosives inside or near the mosque, causing significant structural damage and scattering debris across the surrounding area. ISIL&#39;s Pakistan branch (ISPP) claimed responsibility for what appears to be its deadliest operation in the country since its formation in May 2019. Pakistani authorities arrested four alleged &quot;facilitators&quot; on February 7 as thousands of mourners attended funeral prayers for the victims.</p>
<p>The attack comes amid a surge in militant violence across Pakistan, following the Balochistan Liberation Army&#39;s &quot;Operation Herof 2.0&quot; in late January that killed over 225 people across nine districts. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the bombing as a &quot;cowardly act of terrorism&quot; and declared a state of emergency in the capital, with hospitals appealing for blood donations. The UN Secretary-General also condemned the attack, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>The bombing has sharpened focus on cross-border security challenges, with Pakistani officials pointing to militant safe havens along the Afghan-Pakistan border. The escalating violence — from Balochistan separatist attacks to sectarian bombings in the capital — underscores the breadth of security threats facing Pakistan&#39;s government as it struggles to contain multiple insurgent and extremist movements simultaneously.</p>

<h3>4. Russia Escalates Hybrid Warfare Across Europe with Sabotage and Infrastructure Attacks</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia has dramatically escalated its hybrid warfare campaign against Western Europe since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with intelligence reports confirming a four-fold increase in sabotage operations in 2024 compared to the prior year and the surge accelerating through 2025 and into 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polish authorities revealed that two Ukrainian citizens hired by Russian intelligence used explosives to attempt to destroy a Warsaw-Ukraine railway line in November 2025 — a route crucially important for delivering military aid to Ukraine. A train conductor noticed the warped rail near the village of Mika, approximately 130 kilometers from the Polish-Ukrainian border, and alerted police. Poland subsequently expelled Russia&#39;s consul in Gdansk, and Interpol issued red notices for the two suspects, believed to have fled to Belarus.</p>
<p>Experts identify three pillars of Russian hybrid warfare expected to escalate in 2026: sabotage targeting Europe&#39;s expanding defense production infrastructure and Ukraine-bound supply chains; subversion through information warfare during key elections including Hungary&#39;s 2026 vote and the U.S. midterms; and coercion through increasingly aggressive airspace and naval violations. The attack on Romania&#39;s Cugir arms factory last year demonstrated Russia&#39;s willingness to target defense manufacturing directly.</p>
<p>Moscow&#39;s strategic objective is to weaken Western unity by creating a constant sense of vulnerability without crossing the threshold that would trigger a formal NATO response. Analysts warn that Europe still lacks credible hybrid deterrence, and the West&#39;s failure to establish clear thresholds for hybrid warfare has created a strategic vacuum that Russia continues to exploit. The campaign has expanded from espionage into drone-based airport shutdowns, arson attacks, and direct targeting of critical infrastructure.</p>

<h3>5. State Department Orders Deletion of All Pre-Trump Social Media Posts from Official Accounts</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. State Department has directed the removal of all posts made by its official accounts on the social media platform X before President Trump returned to office on January 20, 2025, with staff told that anyone wanting to access the deleted content must file a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The directive applies to all the department&#39;s active official X accounts, including those for U.S. embassies and missions worldwide, ambassadors, department bureaus, and programs, according to internal guidance screenshots obtained by NPR. The posts to be removed include embassy July 4th livestreams, photos of COVID vaccine donations to other nations, holiday greetings, condolences, cultural programming, and the day-to-day record of diplomatic engagements showing who the U.S. met with, when, and how.</p>
<p>Current and former State Department employees, as well as academics, have raised concerns that the purge will make the historical record of government communications and actions harder to trace. While the posts will be internally archived, requiring FOIA requests for access differs significantly from how the U.S. government typically handles archiving the online footprint of previous administrations. Critics argue the move effectively erases the public digital record of American diplomacy spanning multiple years.</p>
<p>The social media purge comes as the State Department undergoes broader changes under the Trump administration, with the deletion order representing one of the most sweeping acts of institutional digital erasure in modern U.S. government history. The move raises questions about government transparency and the preservation of public records, particularly as social media has become a primary channel through which governments communicate with domestic and international audiences.</p>

<h3>6. Colombia-Ecuador Trade War Escalates with Tit-for-Tat Tariffs and Energy Cutoffs</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecuador&#39;s imposition of a 30% &quot;security tariff&quot; on Colombian imports over drug trafficking failures has spiraled into a full-scale trade war, with Colombia retaliating by halting electricity exports, imposing reciprocal tariffs, and Ecuador responding with a 900% increase in oil pipeline fees for Colombian crude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crisis erupted when President Daniel Noboa announced Ecuador would levy a 30% tariff on its neighbor until Colombia showed &quot;a real commitment to jointly confronting drug-trafficking and illegal mining at the border.&quot; Colombia&#39;s Ministry of Commerce responded with a 30% tariff on 23 Ecuadorian products, while the Ministry of Mines and Energy announced an indefinite suspension of all international electricity sales to Ecuador, framing the move as essential to safeguarding Colombia&#39;s energy sovereignty.</p>
<p>The escalation has spread to energy infrastructure, with Ecuador raising the tariff for each barrel of Colombian oil transported through its state-owned Trans-Ecuadorian Oil Pipeline System from $3 to $30 per barrel — a 900% increase. Colombian and Ecuadorian merchants and truckers have staged protests at border crossings, warning that the trade war will devastate border economies and disrupt energy supplies in both countries. The reciprocal tariffs are affecting bilateral commerce worth approximately $2.3 billion annually.</p>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro met with President Trump in Washington on February 3 and reportedly asked the U.S. to mediate the dispute. Ecuador faces a trade deficit of more than $1 billion with Colombia, and Noboa has framed the tariffs as a national security measure against narcotics trafficking. However, analysts warn that the economic fallout — particularly the suspension of Colombian electricity to an energy-dependent Ecuador — risks creating a humanitarian dimension to what began as a diplomatic dispute.</p>

<h3>7. US Government Shutdown Ends But DHS Faces Second Closure as ICE Reform Talks Stall</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The partial U.S. government shutdown that began January 31 ended on February 3 when Trump signed a $1 trillion spending package, but the Department of Homeland Security faces a second shutdown on February 13 as negotiations over ICE reform demands remain deadlocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The House approved the spending package 217-214, funding several of the government&#39;s largest departments through September. However, the deal separated DHS funding into a two-week extension, giving lawmakers until February 13 to negotiate Democratic demands for immigration enforcement reforms prompted by the killings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti during ICE operations in Minneapolis. Democrats are demanding body cameras, identification requirements, a ban on agents hiding their identities, and judicial warrants for enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer issued a list of 10 demands, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune described reaching agreement in the remaining time as &quot;an impossibility.&quot; Republicans say they are open to body-worn cameras — already included in the underlying DHS spending bill with $20 million allocated — but reject warrant restrictions and mask bans. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered body cameras for agents in Minneapolis but Democrats want reforms codified into law rather than relying on executive discretion.</p>
<p>The funding impasse has broader consequences beyond DHS operations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39; January jobs report was delayed from February 7 to February 11 due to the shutdown&#39;s disruption of data collection. With only days remaining before the DHS funding deadline, the prospect of a second partial shutdown looms large, creating additional uncertainty for markets and federal employees already rattled by the first closure.</p>

<h3>8. Zelensky Reveals 55,000 Ukrainian Soldiers Killed as War Nears Fourth Anniversary</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky disclosed that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, with a &quot;large number&quot; still officially missing, as the war approaches its fourth anniversary amid ongoing peace talks in Abu Dhabi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure represents a significant increase from Zelensky&#39;s previous disclosures — 46,000 killed reported in February 2025 and 31,000 in February 2024 — suggesting the pace of casualties has not meaningfully slowed despite changes in the front-line dynamics. Independent estimates from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies place the actual toll significantly higher, between 100,000 and 140,000 killed, suggesting official figures substantially undercount the true cost of the conflict.</p>
<p>Zelensky&#39;s revelation came in an interview with French media ahead of the second round of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi, timed to build public support for meaningful negotiations as European and American audiences increasingly focus on the war&#39;s human cost. The disclosure represents a rare moment of public candor from Kyiv, which has generally withheld detailed casualty figures to maintain domestic morale and international support.</p>
<p>The fourth winter of Russia&#39;s war has been particularly brutal, with heat and electricity blackouts lasting for days as Russia repeatedly targets Ukraine&#39;s energy grid. The toll on Ukrainian society extends far beyond military casualties, with millions displaced internally and abroad. As peace talks continue, the cumulative human cost of the war — now acknowledged at unprecedented scale by Ukraine&#39;s own president — is increasingly shaping the calculus of all parties involved in negotiations.</p>

<h3>9. Winter Olympics Competition Begins with First Gold Medals Awarded in Milan Cortina</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2026 Winter Olympics entered full competition mode on Saturday, with Swiss racer Franjo von Allmen capturing the Olympic downhill to win the first gold medal of the Milan Cortina Games, as medal events begin across cross-country skiing, speed skating, snowboarding, and other disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day after Thursday&#39;s spectacular opening ceremony at Milan&#39;s San Siro stadium — which featured dual cauldron lightings in Milan and Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo and performances by Andrea Bocelli and Mariah Carey — athletes from 93 countries began competing across venues spanning northern Italy&#39;s Lombardy and Veneto regions. The Games, Italy&#39;s first Winter Olympics since Turin 2006, feature 116 medal events across 16 disciplines through February 22.</p>
<p>One of the most closely watched storylines is American alpine skiing legend Lindsey Vonn, who announced her return to professional racing in November 2024 with the goal of competing in Milan Cortina. However, just a week before the opening ceremony, Vonn crashed in Crans Montana, Switzerland, completely rupturing her ACL. Despite the injury, she has confirmed she will race in the women&#39;s downhill on Sunday, February 8, in what would be a remarkable feat of determination.</p>
<p>The Games carry significant geopolitical undertones as the world&#39;s athletes compete against a backdrop of ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, rising U.S.-Iran tensions, and trade disputes across multiple continents. The ceremony&#39;s theme of &quot;Harmony&quot; — reflecting the connection between Milan and Cortina despite the physical distance — offers a contrast to the fractured state of international relations outside the Olympic venues.</p>

<h3>10. EU-China Trade Tensions Deepen as Beijing&#39;s Industrial Overcapacity Threatens European Manufacturing</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Union faces what economists are calling a second &quot;China shock&quot; as Beijing&#39;s industrial overcapacity spreads beyond electric vehicles into semiconductors, wind components, pharmaceuticals, and industrial machinery, threatening the foundations of Europe&#39;s manufacturing base while bilateral trade imbalances widen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China now accounts for roughly one-third of total global value-added manufacturing, with its trade surplus approaching $1 trillion last year as domestic consumption fails to keep pace with industrial output. The EU, as China&#39;s largest export partner, is piling up protective measures including a planned fixed customs duty on low-value e-commerce parcels from July 2026, aimed at curbing cheap imports predominantly from China. Meanwhile, China has retaliated against EU electric vehicle tariffs by targeting European dairy, brandy, and pork imports.</p>
<p>The semiconductor dimension adds a strategic security layer to the economic tensions. Beijing has long argued the EU could help rebalance trade by selling advanced chips and manufacturing equipment currently under export restrictions, but European leaders remain wary of enabling Chinese technological advancement in sensitive areas. A recent shift in U.S. policy — with Trump authorizing sales of some advanced Nvidia chips to China — has complicated Europe&#39;s own calculus, as analysts note that outright restrictions have paradoxically incentivized China to develop its own semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>A critical moment approaches with China&#39;s anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy imports set to conclude on February 21, with provisional tariffs on European dairy products already reduced from as high as 42.7% to 11.7%. On the EV front, both sides have made progress toward a minimum price mechanism that could replace punitive tariffs. However, the structural challenge remains: Chinese overinvestment across a range of industries shows no signs of abating, leaving Europe caught between protecting domestic industry and maintaining access to affordable goods.</p>

<h3>1. Gold Surges Past $5,000 to Record Highs as Safe-Haven Demand Soars</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gold blasted through the $5,000 per ounce barrier for the first time in history, surging to $5,078 on Wednesday in its strongest single-day rally in 20 years, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, central bank buying, and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The precious metal&#39;s ascent has been staggering — up 73.6% compared to a year ago and 11.4% in just the past month. Central bank purchases have been a major catalyst, with Beijing extending its gold-buying streak for a 13th consecutive month, adding 30,000 ounces to reserves and bringing China&#39;s total stock to 74.12 million ounces. The de-dollarization trend among emerging market central banks has created sustained structural demand independent of traditional safe-haven flows.</p>
<p>JPMorgan issued its most bullish gold forecast yet at $6,300 per ounce by year-end 2026, while Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale target $6,000. The rally reflects a convergence of factors rarely seen simultaneously: rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the ongoing Ukraine war, persistent inflation concerns, a weakening U.S. dollar, and growing uncertainty about the trajectory of Federal Reserve policy. Gold&#39;s breakout above $5,000 triggered significant momentum-driven buying.</p>
<p>However, the rally has not been without volatility. After reaching $5,600 intraday on February 4, gold experienced a sharp pullback to $4,770 by Friday, a correction of nearly 15% that rattled traders who had chased the breakout higher. The whipsaw action underscores the speculative froth that has entered the gold market alongside genuine safe-haven demand, with analysts warning that while the structural bull case remains intact, the pace of gains has created conditions ripe for violent corrections.</p>

<h3>2. Palantir Surges 11% After Blowout Earnings as AI Government Spending Boom Lifts Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Technologies reported Q4 2025 revenue of $1.41 billion — up 70% year-over-year — beating estimates of $1.33 billion with adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share versus expectations of 23 cents, sending shares up 11% as CEO Alex Karp called it &quot;the best results that I&#39;m aware of in tech in the last decade.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. commercial revenue surged 137% to $507 million, while government revenue grew 66% year-over-year, driven by new contracts including a $448 million U.S. Navy deal to launch ShipOS for AI-powered shipbuilding modernization. Total contract value reached $4.26 billion, up 138% from the prior year. The Pentagon&#39;s 2026 budget request included a record $13.4 billion dedicated line item for AI — the first in DoD history — positioning Palantir as a primary beneficiary of the government AI spending wave.</p>
<p>Management guided 2026 revenue to $7.18-$7.20 billion, implying an accelerated growth rate above 60% that would make Palantir the fastest company in software history to approach $10 billion in annual revenue at its current margins. The guidance far exceeded Wall Street expectations and triggered a wave of analyst upgrades. William Blair upgraded shares to Buy ahead of the report with a $200 price target, and multiple firms raised their estimates following the results.</p>
<p>The stock&#39;s valuation remains a point of contention, with Palantir trading at approximately 174 times forward earnings and a forward price-to-sales ratio of 67.5. While the growth trajectory is exceptional, the rich multiple exposes the stock to sharp corrections on any disappointment. The company&#39;s positioning at the intersection of government AI spending and commercial enterprise adoption has made it one of the market&#39;s most debated stocks, with bulls pointing to the unprecedented demand environment and bears arguing that the valuation already prices in perfection.</p>

<h3>3. Crude Oil Surges to Six-Month Highs on Iran Risk Premium Before Diplomatic Whipsaw</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent crude oil breached $72 per barrel, marking a six-month high as the U.S.-Iran standoff drove a geopolitical risk premium estimated at $7-$8 per barrel, before crashing back toward $60 on Friday as diplomatic progress in Oman talks drained the war premium overnight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rally saw prices climb nearly 12% from the start of the year, fueled by the U.S. Navy&#39;s deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the Arabian Sea and the subsequent shoot-down of an Iranian Shahed-139 drone on February 3. Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard Corps also harassed a U.S.-flagged merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, with two IRGC boats and a drone threatening to board and seize the tanker Stena Imperative — escalating fears of a disruption to the waterway through which a fifth of global oil and LNG passes.</p>
<p>Energy analysts placed the probability of a U.S. strike on Iran at 75% in the coming weeks, while Polymarket volumes on Iran strike prediction markets hit $188 million. OPEC+ added to supply uncertainty by extending voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through Q1 2026, with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other producers agreeing to pause planned output increases. BloombergNEF projected oil could reach $91 per barrel by late 2026 in an Iran disruption scenario.</p>
<p>The dramatic reversal came Friday after diplomatic talks in Oman produced what Iran called &quot;a good start,&quot; with crude plunging back toward $60 as the risk premium evaporated almost instantly. The volatile week illustrated how geopolitical speculation has become the dominant short-term driver of energy markets, overwhelming fundamental factors like demand weakness and projected oversupply. The EIA forecasts Brent averaging just $56 per barrel in 2026 if geopolitical tensions ease — a staggering gap from the $72 highs reached during the week&#39;s peak anxiety.</p>

<h3>4. Bitcoin Plummets Below $61,000 in Worst Single-Day Crash Since FTX Collapse</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin suffered its steepest one-day decline since the FTX-driven crash in November 2022, plunging 15% to touch $60,062 as forced deleveraging cascaded through cryptocurrency markets, triggering $2.6 billion in liquidations and marking a 52% drawdown from its October 2025 record high of $126,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff accelerated through the week as multiple negative catalysts converged: institutional demand reversed with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recording outsized net outflows, leveraged positions worth billions were forcibly unwound, and broader risk-off sentiment from the equity market tech rout spilled into digital assets. Record realized losses of approximately $3.2 billion were recorded on February 5 alone, while the total crypto market shed roughly $900 billion in market capitalization over the preceding 22 days.</p>
<p>Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan characterized the decline as &quot;a full-bore, 2022-like crypto winter,&quot; while prediction markets placed a 56% probability on Bitcoin sliding to $70,000 or below before month&#39;s end. The token briefly recovered to $69,632 on Friday, gaining 9% in a relief bounce, but analysts warned the technical damage may take considerable time to repair. The unwinding of leveraged bets has wiped out all gains accumulated since President Trump&#39;s election.</p>
<p>The crypto winter marks a dramatic reversal from the optimism that surrounded Trump&#39;s pro-crypto stance, his appointment of crypto-friendly regulators, and the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Despite these policy tailwinds, macroeconomic headwinds — including equity market volatility, geopolitical uncertainty, rising correlations with risk assets, and waning institutional appetite — have overwhelmed the bullish narrative. The total cryptocurrency market lost approximately $350 billion in a single day on February 6, with the selloff extending to Ethereum, Solana, and virtually every major digital asset.</p>

<h3>5. Disney Names Josh D&#39;Amaro as Next CEO to Succeed Bob Iger Effective March 18</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney Company named Josh D&#39;Amaro, the 28-year company veteran who leads its Experiences division encompassing theme parks, cruise ships, and resorts, as its next chief executive officer to replace Bob Iger, marking the second CEO succession attempt in six years after Iger&#39;s previous pick Bob Chapek was ousted in 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D&#39;Amaro&#39;s appointment comes with a compensation package worth up to $45 million, with Iger remaining as a board member and senior advisor through the end of 2026. Dana Walden was simultaneously named president and chief creative officer, reporting to D&#39;Amaro effective March 18. The transition ends a closely watched succession process that had narrowed to D&#39;Amaro and Walden as the two internal frontrunners, with the board ultimately selecting the executive whose division generates the company&#39;s highest margins.</p>
<p>Disney reported fiscal Q1 2026 results the same week, with revenue of $25.98 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.63 beating analyst expectations of $25.74 billion and $1.57 respectively. Strength in parks and streaming drove the outperformance, though shares initially dropped 7% after the company warned of headwinds from declining international tourist attendance at domestic parks — a trend attributed to the strong U.S. dollar and global economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>D&#39;Amaro inherits a company navigating multiple strategic crossroads: the streaming business has turned profitable but faces intensifying competition, the parks division requires massive capital investment to maintain competitive advantages, and the traditional media business continues its structural decline. Analysts note that D&#39;Amaro&#39;s parks background positions him well for Disney&#39;s highest-margin business but raises questions about his approach to content strategy and the company&#39;s evolving relationship with technology platforms.</p>

<h3>6. UPS to Cut 30,000 Jobs in 2026 as Amazon Breakup Reshapes Delivery Giant</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 27</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>United Parcel Service announced plans to eliminate 30,000 positions in 2026 through attrition and voluntary separation programs, while closing 24 buildings in the first half of the year, as the shipping giant continues unwinding its partnership with Amazon in a transformation expected to save $3 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The job cuts follow 48,000 positions eliminated in 2025, making UPS one of the largest sources of U.S. job losses over the two-year period. The company reduced Amazon&#39;s volume by approximately 1 million packages per day in 2025 and plans to cut another million pieces daily in 2026, reducing total operational hours by approximately 25 million. The Amazon wind-down represents a deliberate strategic pivot away from low-margin e-commerce delivery toward higher-value healthcare, small business, and specialty shipping markets.</p>
<p>The reductions will be accomplished primarily through attrition, with UPS offering a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers. The 24 buildings identified for closure in the first half of 2026 reflect the shrinking physical footprint needed as Amazon volumes decline, with additional closures possible later in the year. The company&#39;s network optimization efforts aim to improve operating margins that had been compressed by the high-volume, low-margin Amazon business.</p>
<p>The announcement contributed to January&#39;s overall layoff total of 108,435 — the highest January figure since 2009 — alongside Amazon&#39;s own 16,000 cuts and significant reductions in healthcare, technology, and financial services. The UPS transformation underscores a broader restructuring across logistics and transportation as companies reassess business relationships and workforce needs in a slowing economy. Analysts note that while the short-term pain is significant, the strategic pivot should improve UPS&#39;s margin profile and competitive positioning over the medium term.</p>

<h3>7. OPEC+ Extends Production Cuts Through Q1 2026 as Iran Tensions Reshape Oil Markets</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eight key OPEC+ producers — Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman — agreed to maintain voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through March 2026, pausing planned output increases due to seasonal factors and geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision, made during a virtual meeting on February 1, keeps the alliance&#39;s most significant production restraint in place through the first quarter, with the previously announced barrels to be returned to the market &quot;either in part or in full, depending on evolving market conditions, and only in a gradual manner.&quot; The group&#39;s next meeting is scheduled for March, when members will reassess conditions including the trajectory of U.S.-Iran tensions, Chinese demand recovery, and the impact of potential tariff escalation on global economic growth.</p>
<p>The production freeze comes as geopolitical factors have overtaken fundamentals as the primary driver of oil prices. Brent crude rallied to $72 per barrel — its highest level in six months — on fears of a U.S. military strike on Iran, with analysts estimating a $7-$8 per barrel risk premium embedded in prices. The rally temporarily masked a more bearish fundamental outlook: the EIA forecasts global oil production will exceed demand in 2026, causing inventories to rise and prices to average just $56 per barrel absent major supply disruptions.</p>
<p>Internal OPEC+ dynamics remain strained despite the show of unity. A Saudi-UAE spat over production quotas continues to simmer, with the UAE pressing for a larger output allocation to match its expanded production capacity. Compensation cuts have tripled as key producers move to rein in members who exceeded quotas. Meanwhile, the potential disruption of Iranian supply through military action or tighter sanctions adds a wildcard that could dramatically alter the supply-demand balance and force OPEC+ to recalibrate its strategy.</p>

<h3>8. Dow Crosses 50,000 for First Time as Friday Rally Caps Volatile Week</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,207 points, or 2.47%, to close at a record 50,115 on Friday, crossing the 50,000 milestone for the first time as investors rotated aggressively from battered technology stocks into value names, financials, and industrials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The historic close capped one of the most volatile weeks in recent market memory, during which the S&amp;P 500 briefly turned negative for 2026, the Nasdaq endured a tech-driven rout, and South Korea&#39;s KOSPI triggered three circuit breakers in five sessions. Friday&#39;s rally was broad-based, with chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom gaining 7.8% and 7.2% respectively as investors reconsidered the selloff&#39;s severity. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1.97% to 6,932, while the Nasdaq advanced 2.18% to 23,031.</p>
<p>Despite the Friday surge, the week revealed deepening fractures beneath the market&#39;s surface. The &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; mega-cap stocks diverged sharply: Alphabet&#39;s $185 billion AI spending plan initially spooked investors before shares recovered, while Amazon plunged 8% on its own $200 billion capex forecast and an earnings miss. The rotation from growth into value accelerated, with the Dow&#39;s 2.5% weekly gain contrasting with the Nasdaq&#39;s 1.8% weekly decline.</p>
<p>The Dow&#39;s milestone comes in a markedly different character than previous round-number breakthroughs, driven less by broad economic optimism than by a flight from overvalued technology shares into defensive sectors. Manufacturing data provided a tailwind, with ISM and S&amp;P Global PMIs showing the sharpest increase in production since May 2022. However, the delayed January jobs report, ongoing government shutdown uncertainty, and unresolved questions about AI spending returns leave investors navigating with limited visibility into the economy&#39;s true trajectory.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank held rates unchanged at 2% for a fifth consecutive meeting while the Bank of England voted 5-4 to maintain rates at 3.75% in a closer-than-expected decision, as both central banks grappled with persistent inflation against a backdrop of weakening growth and external risks from U.S. tariff threats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bank of England&#39;s narrow vote surprised markets, with four members pushing for a 25-basis-point cut to 3.5% versus forecasts of a 7-2 hold. The tight margin signals growing internal divisions over the pace of monetary easing, with pay growth and services price inflation continuing to ease while the UK economy shows signs of strain. UK borrowing costs came under additional pressure from the Mandelson-Epstein political crisis, adding to the challenging backdrop for policymakers.</p>
<p>ECB President Christine Lagarde played down concerns about the euro&#39;s recent strength but warned the outlook remained &quot;unpredictable&quot; given tariff threats and currency volatility. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the rest of 2026, with the updated assessment confirming inflation should stabilize at the 2% target in the medium term. Eurozone economies continue to grapple with weak manufacturing output and uncertain trade policy under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The coordinated holds reflect the global challenge facing central bankers as the post-pandemic inflation cycle enters its final phase. U.S. Treasury yields fell to around 4.22% on the 10-year as weaker employment data reinforced bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts, with markets pricing a first reduction in June and a second potentially in September. The divergence between a data-dependent Fed and a politically constrained ECB creates cross-currents in currency and bond markets that add complexity to an already challenging investment landscape.</p>

<h3>10. Amazon Falls 8% on $200 Billion AI Spending Forecast Despite Strong AWS Growth</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon shares plunged 8% on Friday after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results — with earnings per share of $1.95 missing estimates of $1.97 — and stunned investors by projecting $200 billion in 2026 capital expenditure, the largest spending commitment of any technology company in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AWS revenue expanded 24% in Q4 to beat expectations, marking what the unit&#39;s CEO called &quot;the fastest growth in 13 quarters,&quot; while total company revenue of $213.39 billion topped the $211.33 billion consensus. However, the bottom-line miss combined with the staggering capex guidance triggered an immediate selloff as investors questioned the returns timeline on such massive AI infrastructure investment. The spending plan represents a near-doubling from 2025 levels and would make Amazon the second-largest corporate capital spender after Alphabet, which announced its own $185 billion plan days earlier.</p>
<p>The combined $385 billion in AI spending commitments from just two companies in a single week crystallized investor anxiety about the AI investment cycle. Big Tech&#39;s aggregate AI capital expenditure is now approaching $700 billion, with investors increasingly asking whether these investments can generate proportional returns within a reasonable timeframe. The market&#39;s negative reaction to Amazon&#39;s plans contrasted with Alphabet&#39;s relatively muted response, suggesting that investor tolerance for AI spending escalation is reaching a breaking point.</p>
<p>Despite the near-term concerns, Amazon&#39;s cloud computing business showed genuine strength, with AWS operating income and margins improving as AI workloads drive higher-value consumption patterns. The company is investing in custom AI chips, data center construction, and networking infrastructure to serve demand from enterprise customers and its own AI services. Analysts remain broadly positive on the stock&#39;s long-term trajectory but acknowledge that the sheer scale of capital commitment creates meaningful execution risk and limits near-term earnings growth.</p>

<h2>Geopolitical News (Top 10)</h2>
<h3>1. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Assassinated in Libya, Sparking International Probe</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and a leading presidential candidate, was assassinated by four masked gunmen at his home in Zintan, Libya, ending hopes for political reconciliation in the fractured North African nation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaddafi&#39;s political team released a statement describing the February 3 attack as a &quot;cowardly and treacherous assassination&quot; in which four masked gunmen raided Gaddafi&#39;s home after disabling security cameras. Forensic experts dispatched to Zintan confirmed that &quot;the victim died from wounds by gunfire,&quot; with Gaddafi, 53, dying at the scene. The public prosecutor&#39;s office has launched an investigation into the killing, which occurred in the western Libyan city that had served as Gaddafi&#39;s base since his release from detention.</p>
<p>Saif al-Islam was considered to be his father&#39;s number two from 2000 until 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was killed by Libyan opposition forces during the NATO-backed uprising. The International Criminal Court had wanted him since 2011 for crimes against humanity, and in 2015, a court in Tripoli sentenced him to death by firing squad in absentia for war crimes. Despite these legal challenges, Gaddafi had emerged as the only figure who could coalesce the &quot;Green&quot; constituency loyal to his father&#39;s legacy, and political opponents worried that he might take votes not only from supporters of the former regime but also from those fed up with Libya&#39;s current state of dysfunction.</p>
<p>Thousands of people attended Gaddafi&#39;s funeral on Friday in the town of Bani Walid, some 175 kilometres south of Tripoli. Some reports allege foreign involvement, with France and the United Kingdom reportedly involved in the assassination, though these claims remain unverified allegations. The killing marks the end of a political era in Libya and removes one of the few figures with sufficient legitimacy to potentially unify the country&#39;s competing factions, leaving Libya&#39;s path to stability even more uncertain.</p>
<h3>2. US Conducts Christmas Day Airstrikes in Nigeria Targeting ISIS, Claims Christian Protection</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Dec 25-Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on ISIS targets in Sokoto state, northwest Nigeria, on Christmas Day, framing the operation as defending Christians from genocide—a characterization that has sparked intense debate over the accuracy of the administration&#39;s rationale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The United States conducted airstrikes on ISIS targets in Sokoto state in northwest Nigeria on December 25, 2025, with President Trump stating the strikes were intended to &quot;decimate the ISIS terrorists who have been slaughtering Christians in that country by the thousands.&quot; At the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., on February 6, 2026, Trump confirmed that the United States collaborated closely with the Nigerian government to conduct these airstrikes, revealing he specifically ordered the strikes to occur on Christmas Day, saying &quot;I said no, do it on Christmas. So they understand it.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the characterization of the violence as specifically targeting Christians has been disputed by experts and conflict monitors. While there are attacks by the Islamic State against Christians, they also attack Muslims who don&#39;t believe in their extremist worldview. Data from conflict monitor ACLED show a rise in Christian fatalities, mostly in Central Nigeria, but the vast majority of incidents were over land disputes rather than targeting based on religion. From a legal definition standpoint, claims of genocide don&#39;t hold up according to international law experts.</p>
<p>Isolated strikes like these are unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the region, with losses representing only a small fraction of Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Lakurawa resources. There are concerns about civilian casualties in Sokoto, the use of poor intelligence, and the fact that none of the locations targeted were affected by Islamic State-related activity according to some analysts. Nigerian Catholic Church leaders gave mixed reactions to the US airstrikes, with some welcoming the support while others expressed concerns about sovereignty and the effectiveness of military approaches to addressing complex security challenges in Nigeria&#39;s northwest.</p>
<h3>3. New START Treaty Expires, Ending Five Decades of US-Russia Nuclear Arms Control</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New START treaty expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time since the early 1970s that no legally binding limits exist on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces, raising fears of an unchecked nuclear arms race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New START treaty, which capped the US and Russia each at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers, and up to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers, expired after exhausting its five-year extension negotiated by the Biden administration in 2021. The treaty also established detailed transparency and verification mechanisms, including data exchanges, notifications, and on-site inspections that provided critical insight into each nation&#39;s nuclear capabilities.</p>
<p>Russia suspended the treaty in early 2023 over Washington&#39;s support for Ukraine, though Moscow said it would still observe agreed upon restrictions. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to voluntarily continue to abide by the treaty&#39;s limits for another year. However, President Donald Trump referred to the treaty as a &quot;badly negotiated deal&quot; and said that rather than extend it, &quot;we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty.&quot;</p>
<p>Trump has suggested that if New START expires, a &quot;better&quot; agreement could be negotiated and said that China should be included. However, Beijing has consistently argued that it will not join formal arms control negotiations while its arsenal remains far smaller than those of the US and Russia. The expiration signals a move away from nuclear restraint, making the world a more dangerous place. The U.S. and Russia possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons, or more than 10,500 warheads combined, and without treaty limits, both nations could potentially expand their arsenals unchecked, raising the specter of a new nuclear arms race reminiscent of the Cold War era.</p>
<h3>4. Trump Administration Foreign Aid Cuts Linked to Over 350,000 Deaths</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 350,000 deaths, including over 200,000 children, have been attributed to the Trump administration&#39;s foreign aid cuts following the January 2025 executive order that suspended USAID funding worldwide, according to multiple independent assessments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14169 suspending foreign aid pending a review. Following Trump&#39;s executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Peter Marocco issued a stop work order on all 6,200 grants and contracts worldwide, effectively freezing lifesaving health and food aid programs across the developing world. The administration permanently cancelled 83 percent of USAID&#39;s global contracts just weeks after the executive order, enacting what amounts to an 85 percent cut to U.S. aid programs by March.</p>
<p>Multiple sources report significant death tolls associated with the aid cuts. Senator Brian Schatz noted that over 360,000 people had already died as a result of not having food and medication in the wake of the funding cuts. Other estimates suggest that some 600,000 people have died in the past year after being cut off of lifesaving health and food aid provided by USAID—about two thirds of them children. The cuts have affected HIV/AIDS treatment programs, maternal and child health initiatives, nutrition programs for malnourished children, and clean water projects across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</p>
<p>UN experts have stated that the US Government is &quot;fuelling global humanitarian catastrophe&quot; through these cuts. As of February 2026, Congress has allocated $50 billion for foreign aid in 2026—a 16% cut from 2025—representing a partial restoration but still far below previous funding levels. Congressional Democrats have launched investigations into aid-related deaths, with Representatives Brad Sherman and Gregory Meeks leading all Foreign Affairs Committee Democrats in demanding accountability for the humanitarian consequences of the funding suspension. The aid cuts represent one of the most dramatic shifts in US foreign policy in decades, with consequences that will likely be felt for years across developing nations that had relied on American assistance.</p>
<h3>5. Kazakhstan Prosecutes 19 Activists Under Chinese Pressure Over Xinjiang Protests</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>China appears to have pressured Kazakhstan to prosecute 19 activists who protested Beijing&#39;s mass detention of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, with Kazakh authorities using a Chinese diplomatic note as key evidence to charge the activists with &quot;inciting ethnic discord.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 23, 2026, the trial of the 19 defenders began in the city of Taldykorgan, reportedly held behind closed doors. The defenders are accused of &quot;inciting ethnic or national discord&quot; under Article 174(2) of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan, which carries a sentence of up to ten years&#39; imprisonment. The case centers on a November 13 demonstration in the village of Qalzhat in eastern Kazakhstan, just a few kilometers from the Chinese border, where the group gathered to protest China&#39;s treatment of ethnic Kazakhs and Uyghurs in Xinjiang and to demand the release of Alimnur Turghanbai, a naturalized Kazakh citizen originally from Xinjiang who has been detained in China since July.</p>
<p>The charges stem from the demonstration where activists burned three Chinese flags and a portrait of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The protest &quot;negatively impacted the two nations&#39; friendship,&quot; according to a Kazakh indictment, with &quot;The Chinese side has expressed serious concerns regarding the incident.&quot; China&#39;s Consulate General expressed hope that the action would be properly investigated, and Chinese diplomatic pressure appears to have been instrumental in Kazakhstan&#39;s decision to prosecute the activists. Among those detained is Nazigul Maksutkhan, who was seven months pregnant at the time of her arrest.</p>
<p>Rights groups call the case politically motivated and say it shows Kazakhstan&#39;s growing crackdown on dissent and Beijing&#39;s influence in the country. Human Rights Watch has called for charges to be dropped, stating that the prosecution represents a troubling precedent of China&#39;s cross-border influence in suppressing criticism of its Xinjiang policies. The case highlights the difficult balancing act Kazakhstan faces between maintaining sovereignty and managing its relationship with powerful neighbor China, which has significant economic leverage over the Central Asian nation.</p>
<h3>6. Venezuela&#39;s Maduro Captured by US Forces in Controversial January Operation</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 3-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Donald J. Trump announced the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro following a January 3 joint U.S. military extraction operation in Venezuela&#39;s capital of Caracas, sparking international condemnation and raising questions about the legality of the intervention under international law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The capture was undertaken by the US Army&#39;s Delta Force, with on-the-ground intelligence provided by the CIA. According to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Maduro was arrested and would face criminal charges in the US related to drug-related offenses. Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were captured at Fort Tiuna, and Trump posted a photograph on his Truth Social account of Maduro on board USS Iwo Jima, showing him blindfolded, with soundproof headphones and a gray Nike sweatsuit, holding a plastic water bottle.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has claimed that the regime change operation in Venezuela was not an act of war but rather a law enforcement operation carried out by U.S. armed forces, pointing to the criminal indictment for President Maduro and his wife for drug-related offenses. However, it is difficult to conceive of possible legal justifications for transporting Maduro to the US, or for the attacks, according to international law experts at Chatham House. There is no UN Security Council mandate that might authorize force, and this was clearly not an instance of a US act of self-defence triggered by a prior or ongoing armed attack by Venezuela.</p>
<p>The attack was condemned by other countries, including Brazil, Chile, China, France, Iran, Mexico, North Korea, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, and Spain. UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that US actions had &quot;worrying implications for the region,&quot; &quot;constitute[d] a dangerous precedent,&quot; and worried &quot;that the rules of international law have not been respected.&quot; Representatives of Russia and China called for the immediate release of President Maduro, while the US representative rejected characterisations of US actions as military aggression, describing the operation as a targeted law enforcement measure to arrest an indicted fugitive. Venezuela&#39;s interim leader Delcy Rodríguez has moved to privatize the country&#39;s oil industry, potentially opening opportunities for US companies but also creating new regional dynamics.</p>
<h3>7. Europe Explores Weaponization of Finance to Counter Trump Greenland Threats</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3-6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following Trump&#39;s demand to &quot;own&quot; Greenland, European financial experts have openly discussed using Europe&#39;s $6 trillion holdings of US debt as strategic leverage, raising the possibility of a financial confrontation between traditional allies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the Greenland crisis before Davos, Europeans explored tools to counter the Trump administration, with Deutsche Bank&#39;s George Saravelos warning that &quot;Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of [U.S.] treasuries,&quot; suggesting possible &quot;weaponization of capital.&quot; An article published February 3, 2026, discusses how Europe could use finance as leverage, recommending targeted export tariffs, taxes on royalties, and the elimination of US Treasuries&#39; risk-free status as potential tools for Europe.</p>
<p>America&#39;s largest vulnerability is its dependence on foreign investors to finance its massive deficit, projected at about 6% of GDP, with another $1.8 trillion to be added to the existing $38 trillion debt. European investors hold about $6 trillion of US debt—approximately $3 trillion in US Treasuries and another $3 trillion in Treasury-backed US housing-agency debt. When a Deutsche Bank analyst suggested European investors could sell off their US bonds and equities in response to Trump&#39;s Greenland threats, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the risk while warning Europe against such sales.</p>
<p>While Trump has since backed down on the Greenland threats, the episode revealed how far European thinking has evolved in contemplating financial retaliation against the United States. The discussion of weaponizing European holdings of US debt represents a fundamental shift in transatlantic relations, where economic interdependence that once guaranteed cooperation is now being considered as a source of leverage in disputes. The episode underscores the fragility of the post-World War II financial architecture when political tensions between allies reach critical levels, and how quickly the &quot;special relationship&quot; can transform into financial brinkmanship.</p>
<h3>8. Iran Protests Death Toll Passes 6,900 as Revolutionary Guard Intensifies Crackdown</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Dec 2025-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Protests that began in Iran on December 28, 2025, have resulted in over 6,900 confirmed deaths according to human rights monitors, making them among the largest massacres in modern Iranian history as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps intensifies its crackdown on dissent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The protests initially sparked by economic grievances subsequently spread to become among the largest in recent years, quickly evolving into the most serious challenge to the Islamic Republic since the Woman, Life, Freedom movement in 2022–23. As of February 5, 2026, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) had documented a total of 18,571 cases, including 6,941 confirmed deaths, of whom at least 6,495 were protesters, with 11,630 additional cases under review. As of January 25, 2026, total death toll estimates ranged from 3,117 (per Iranian government) to upwards of 36,500 including 209 government-affiliated military and non-military personnel.</p>
<p>Anti-riot police and members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard&#39;s all-volunteer Basij force were deployed during the crackdown. The 2026 Fardis massacre was committed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on January 8, 2026 in Fardis, Alborz province, Iran. Time reported that a specific list included 30,304 protest-related deaths registered in civilian hospitals for January 8 and 9 alone, suggesting the scale of violence reached extraordinary levels during the height of the crackdown.</p>
<p>The European Union and Ukraine designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization in response to the crackdown on protesters. US President Donald Trump encouraged protesters and has threatened several times to strike Iran if they continue killing protesters, with an Iranian official telling the Reuters news agency that about 2,000 people have been killed in the protests, including security personnel. Multiple countries imposed sanctions in response to the violence. The scale of the crackdown and the death toll represent one of the most severe acts of state repression in the 21st century, with implications for Iran&#39;s domestic stability and its international standing.</p>
<h3>9. Gaza Violence Continues Despite Ceasefire, 23 Killed in Deadliest Day Since October</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Israeli air strikes killed 24 people in Gaza on February 4, marking one of the deadliest days since the ceasefire began in October 2025, as violence continues despite the ongoing US-brokered truce entering its second phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gazan health officials reported the deadly toll from a series of Israeli strikes on Wednesday, February 4. The Gazan health ministry said 21 people were killed, including three children, in the series of strikes, with at least 38 others wounded. The territory&#39;s civil defence agency reported two more people were killed in a strike on a tent and another person killed in a strike west of Gaza City. The Israeli military said it launched strikes after &quot;terrorists opened fire on troops&quot; Wednesday, seriously wounding an officer, framing the attacks as defensive responses to ongoing security threats.</p>
<p>Despite an ongoing US-brokered truce entering its second phase, violence has continued in Gaza, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of breaching the agreement. Gaza&#39;s health ministry reports at least 556 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, raising questions about the effectiveness of the truce and the prospects for a lasting peace. The attacks occurred around the same time Israel partly reopened the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing limited humanitarian access and some civilian movement.</p>
<p>The continued violence underscores the fragility of the ceasefire arrangement and the challenges in translating a cessation of major hostilities into a durable peace. Palestinian officials have called for international pressure on Israel to fully respect the ceasefire terms, while Israeli officials cite security concerns and ongoing militant activity as justification for continued military operations. The situation remains volatile, with the potential for the limited violence to escalate back into the large-scale conflict that characterized much of 2024 and early 2025.</p>
<h3>10. T20 Cricket World Cup Opens with Political Controversy as Pakistan Boycotts India Match</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1-7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2026 ICC T20 World Cup began on February 7 amid political turmoil, with Pakistan announcing it would boycott its scheduled Group A match against India on February 15, and Bangladesh being replaced by Scotland following security concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bangladesh was officially replaced by Scotland on January 24, as Scotland was the next highest ranked team in ICC T20 rankings who had not qualified for the tournament. This came after the Bangladesh Cricket Board requested their matches be moved from India citing security reasons, following an incident where Mustafizur Rahman was released by the Kolkata Knight Riders from the 2026 IPL squad. The ICC&#39;s refusal to relocate Bangladesh&#39;s matches from India set the stage for further political complications.</p>
<p>On February 1, 2026, the Government of Pakistan announced that the Pakistan team would boycott its scheduled Group A match against India on February 15. This was reportedly taken in protest against the ICC&#39;s refusal to relocate Bangladesh&#39;s matches out of India. The tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up, with Pakistan refusing to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture. Pakistan are in Group A along with India, Namibia, the Netherlands and the United States, playing all their matches in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The 2026 ICC T20 World Cup is the tenth edition, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8, 2026. The tournament begins with India facing the United States at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai at 7pm local time (13:30 GMT), with holders and favorites India among the main attractions. However, the political controversies threaten to overshadow the sporting competition, highlighting how geopolitical tensions between South Asian neighbors continue to intrude on international sporting events, creating complications for organizers and disappointing fans hoping for marquee matchups.</p>

<p>Short-sellers have made a $24 billion windfall so far in software stocks this year as the overall market value in the industry decreased by $1 trillion, according to data from S3 Partners. Hedge funds are increasing their short bets against software stocks, contributing to the brutal sell-off in the space so far this year. &quot;Hedge funds are all net short software right now,&quot; said Gil Luria, analyst at DA Davidson, highlighting the widespread pessimism about the sector&#39;s prospects in the face of advancing artificial intelligence capabilities.</p>
<p>The hedge fund sources wouldn&#39;t comment on specific names where big short bets are being increased, but said the focus appears to be on companies that provide basic automation services for clients that can be easily replicated by new AI tools. Fears that advanced agentic AI tools from startups like Anthropic are beginning to cannibalize the revenue streams of established enterprise giants led to a localized $1 trillion loss in that sector alone before bleeding into the broader index. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) has fallen more than 21% year-to-date, including an 8% drop this week alone, and is now roughly 30% below its September 2025 peak.</p>
<p>Stocks such as TeraWulf and Asana in the ETF have the biggest total short bets against them currently, according to data from S3 Partners. For TeraWulf, more than 35% of its shares currently available for trading are being sold short, while that figure is 25% for Asana. Dropbox and Cipher Mining have 19% and 17% of their trading float sold short respectively. Among the worst performers in the IGV ETF so far this year are Intuit, a maker of tax preparation software, and DocuSign, which handles PDFs and other documents, with both down more than 30% as investors question whether AI agents will replace their core offerings.</p>
<h3>2. Texas Instruments Acquires Silicon Labs for $7.5 Billion to Expand Wireless Footprint</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Texas Instruments announced it would acquire Silicon Labs for $231.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $7.5 billion, marking its biggest acquisition since the $6.5 billion deal for National Semiconductor in 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Texas Instruments announced on February 4, 2026, that it would acquire Silicon Labs for $231.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $7.5 billion. The acquisition price represents a premium of about 69% to Silicon Labs&#39; last unaffected closing price on Tuesday, when deal talks were first reported. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2027, pending regulatory approvals. Texas Instruments is planning to finance the acquisition through cash on hand and debt.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments agreed to buy Silicon Laboratories to expand its footprint in wireless connectivity chips used for industrial and consumer applications. For Texas Instruments, whose core strength lies in analog chips that manage signals and power in electronic equipment, the acquisition marks its biggest since the $6.5 billion deal for National Semiconductor in 2011. The deal gives Texas Instruments access to Silicon Labs&#39; portfolio of wireless connectivity products including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and proprietary protocols used in Internet of Things devices, smart home products, and industrial automation.</p>
<p>The deal is likely to generate about $450 million in annual manufacturing and operational savings within three years of closing, according to company statements. Silicon Labs brings approximately $1.4 billion in annual revenue and strong margins in the wireless connectivity space, complementing Texas Instruments&#39; existing analog and embedded processing portfolio. The acquisition comes as demand for connectivity chips accelerates across industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics applications, with the Internet of Things market projected to continue rapid growth through the end of the decade.</p>
<h3>3. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss Ousted After Disappointing Forecast and US Wealth Outflows</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Alex Chriss is stepping down with immediate effect as PayPal CEO following disappointing fourth-quarter results announced in early February 2026, with HP CEO Enrique Lores set to take over on March 1 as the payments giant struggles with competitive pressures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alex Chriss is stepping down with immediate effect following disappointing fourth-quarter results announced in early February 2026. Chriss had only joined the digital payments company in September 2023 as president and CEO, making his tenure less than 2.5 years. On March 1, HP CEO Enrique Lores will take over as PayPal&#39;s CEO from Alex Chriss, with CFO Jamie Miller serving as interim CEO until then. The abrupt leadership change reflects the board&#39;s dissatisfaction with the company&#39;s trajectory under Chriss&#39;s leadership.</p>
<p>The departure followed several financial disappointments. The payments giant reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 1.23 dollar per share, missing analysts&#39; expectations of 1.29 dollar. Revenue also fell short, coming in at 8.68 billion dollar—around 90 million dollar below the average analyst estimate. In &quot;Branded Checkout&quot;—the company&#39;s most profitable product line built around the classic PayPal button—currency-adjusted volume increased by just 1 percent, sharply down from the 8 percent growth seen in previous quarters, signaling competitive pressure from newer payment platforms.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s 2026 forecast predicted a low-single-digit drop or a slight rise in adjusted earnings per share, and for the first quarter, PayPal expects a &quot;mid-single-digit&quot; decline in earnings—whereas analysts had been forecasting growth. The disappointing guidance combined with slowing growth in the core business prompted the board to make the leadership change. PayPal faces intense competition from Apple Pay, digital wallets, and emerging fintech players, with the company struggling to maintain its market position as digital payments continue to fragment across multiple platforms.</p>
<h3>4. Bank of America Downgrades Qualcomm as Memory Crunch Throttles Handset Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4-5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bank of America analyst Tal Liani downgraded Qualcomm stock to neutral from buy and lowered the price target to $155 from $215, citing a weaker handset market and share losses as a global memory crunch affects smartphone production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bank of America analyst Tal Liani downgraded Qualcomm stock to neutral from buy rating and lowered the price target to $155 from $215, following Qualcomm&#39;s earnings report on February 4, 2026. The downgrade was primarily driven by weakness in the handset market, which makes up 74% of total Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) revenue. The handset market is expected to see an approximately 15% decline in unit volume this year compared to approximately 2% prior expectations, related to memory pricing volatility.</p>
<p>Rising memory prices are pressuring smartphone makers&#39; inventory plans, particularly in China, with constraints expected to persist for several years. Liani said rising memory prices are affecting the inventory plans of smartphone OEMs, primarily in China, and constraints are expected to persist until 2028, according to Intel. The memory supply shortage has created a cascading effect through the smartphone supply chain, with manufacturers delaying orders for application processors and other components when they cannot secure sufficient memory chips to complete devices.</p>
<p>Beyond memory constraints, the company has previously noted it is losing 25% share at Samsung, share at Apple is expected to decline in September, and China is likely to see seasonal slowdown after last quarter&#39;s handset launch and holiday-driven strength. Qualcomm shares dropped 10.5% in a single session as investors processed a projected 13% year-over-year decline in handset chip revenue. Multiple other financial institutions also cut their price targets and ratings following the weak guidance, with concerns that the headwinds could persist through much of 2026 before stabilizing.</p>
<h3>5. Dow Crosses 50,000 Milestone as Markets Stage Historic Friday Rally</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,206 points to close above 50,000 for the first time in history, with the S&amp;P 500 rallying 2% and the Nasdaq advancing 2.2% as chip stocks led a dramatic recovery from the week&#39;s tech rout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 50,000 for the first time on February 6, 2026, marking a historic milestone for the 30-stock blue-chip index. The Dow finished at a record 50,115.67 on Friday, rising more than 1,200 points for the day in its biggest single-day point gain of 2026. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2% for its best day since May, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,206 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq composite leaped 2.2%. Friday&#39;s rebound followed several days of heavy selling in the tech sector.</p>
<p>Chip companies helped drive the widespread rally, with Nvidia jumping 7.8% to trim its loss for the week, which came into the day at just over 10%. The move caps a strong rally, with the Dow up 4.25% year-to-date and 11.99% over the past year. Financials dominate the index at 27.8% of holdings, with Goldman Sachs alone representing 11.97% of the Dow&#39;s weight. The sector&#39;s strength reflects confidence in banking and payment processors as the Federal Reserve maintains a 3.75% fed funds rate following a 75 basis point cut over the past year.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan&#39;s preliminary consumer sentiment index for February clocked in at 57.3, well above economists&#39; expectations of 54.3, marking the highest reading since August. With unemployment holding steady at 4.4%, the economic backdrop supports continued gains if corporate earnings meet expectations in coming quarters. The milestone represents a psychological victory for bulls who have argued that fears about AI spending and economic slowdown have been overblown, though skeptics note that the Dow&#39;s price-weighted methodology gives outsized influence to a handful of high-priced stocks.</p>
<h3>6. Amazon Plunges 10% on $200 Billion AI Spending Shocker Despite Strong AWS Growth</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5-6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon announced massive capital expenditures of around $200 billion for 2026 in the AI field, triggering a 10% stock decline as investors pivoted their focus from short-term profitability to the staggering spending plan that far exceeded Wall Street expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon announced massive capital expenditures of around $200 billion for 2026 in the AI field, which triggered a significant stock decline. Amazon shares suffered their steepest one-day decline in nearly two years on Friday, February 6, 2026, with the stock tumbling 10% as investors pivoted their focus from short-term profitability to the staggering spending plan. Amazon projected a surge of more than 50% in capital expenditures this year, sending its shares down 11.5% in after-hours trading Thursday. By Friday&#39;s close, Amazon closed at $210.32, down 5.55%, after management outlined plans for roughly $200 billion in 2026 capital expenditures focused on AI and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>The market reaction highlights a growing &quot;sticker shock&quot; among shareholders who had anticipated a more moderate $150 billion capex figure. Shares dropped the most in six months after the company announced plans to spend $200 billion this year on data centers, chips and other equipment, worrying investors that its colossal bet on artificial intelligence may not pay off in the long run. The massive spending plan came despite positive business results, as AWS revenue came in at $35.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year, marking a re-acceleration to the fastest growth rate since 2022.</p>
<p>CEO Andy Jassy defended the investments as necessary to meet surging demand for AI compute capacity, arguing that companies cannot afford to fall behind in the AI infrastructure race. However, the stock&#39;s decline reflected skepticism about near-term margin pressures and uncertainty about when the massive investments will translate into proportionate revenue and profit growth. The spending plan joins similar announcements from Alphabet ($185 billion) and Microsoft ($80 billion), raising questions about whether big tech companies are engaged in an unsustainable capital spending arms race or making prescient investments in the next computing platform.</p>
<h3>7. Nvidia CEO Huang Says AI Demand &quot;Sky High&quot; as Stock Surges 8% Following CNBC Interview</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jensen Huang appeared on CNBC&#39;s Squawk Box to discuss the state of AI, declaring that demand for AI is &quot;just incredibly high&quot; and describing the current moment as a definitive &quot;inflection point,&quot; propelling Nvidia shares up more than 8% on Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jensen Huang appeared on CNBC&#39;s Squawk Box in early February 2026 to discuss the state of the AI industry, making several strong statements about AI demand. Huang told CNBC on Friday that demand for AI is &quot;just incredibly high,&quot; stating that &quot;the demand for Blackwell and our upcoming Vera Rubin platform is sky-high as nations and corporations realize that compute power is the new natural resource.&quot; Huang described the current moment as a definitive &quot;inflection point,&quot; where AI is shifting from an experimental curiosity into a fundamental utility for every industry.</p>
<p>Huang stated during the interview: &quot;We are witnessing the largest infrastructure buildout in human history.&quot; He said that the level of AI expenditures is appropriate and sustainable, and that the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure will continue for seven to eight years. Regarding compute constraints, Huang noted: &quot;These guys are so compute-constrained, and demand is so incredibly great,&quot; referring to AI companies like Anthropic and OpenAI. Huang also defended the massive capital spending by hyperscalers, arguing that companies investing in AI infrastructure are making rational decisions that will pay off over the next decade.</p>
<p>Following the interview, shares of Nvidia surged more than 8% on Friday, February 6, 2026, contributing significantly to the broader market rally. The stock&#39;s performance helped propel the Dow past the 50,000 milestone and provided a counterpoint to concerns about AI spending raised by Amazon and Alphabet&#39;s massive capex plans. Huang&#39;s bullish comments reassured investors that the AI infrastructure buildout has substantial runway remaining, supporting the thesis that semiconductor companies and infrastructure providers will continue to benefit even as questions mount about the returns for those doing the spending.</p>
<h3>8. S&amp;P 500 Turns Negative for 2026 as $1 Trillion Wiped Out Before Friday Rebound</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5-6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index officially turned red for the year during a volatile trading session on February 5, 2026, marking a dramatic reversal from the year&#39;s optimistic start, before recovering slightly on Friday&#39;s rally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index officially turned red for the year during a volatile trading session on February 6, 2026, marking a dramatic reversal from the year&#39;s optimistic start. After a promising January that saw the index climb 1.4%, a brutal three-day rout wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market capitalization. This sudden reversal sent shockwaves through Wall Street, as the benchmark index breached its critical 50-day moving average, triggering technical selling and forcing leveraged funds to reduce positions.</p>
<p>The selloff was driven by multiple factors. Disappointing tech earnings from major &quot;hyperscalers&quot; like Amazon and Alphabet reported massive capital expenditure increases that were not immediately met with the anticipated growth in cloud AI revenue. January&#39;s labor market data on February 5 showed the highest level of monthly layoffs since 2009—over 108,000 jobs lost—raising concerns about economic softening. A hawkish shift in the Federal Reserve&#39;s leadership forced institutional desks to aggressively deleverage, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiking to its highest levels of 2026.</p>
<p>Friday&#39;s 2% rally helped the S&amp;P 500 recover some ground but left the index still negative for the year, reflecting the damage done during the mid-week selloff. The Nasdaq 100 saw its worst two-day rout since October during the first week of February 2026, with the tech-heavy index experiencing significant declines as investors rotated out of technology giants. The volatility underscored concerns about stretched valuations, uncertain AI returns, and a potentially softening economy, though Friday&#39;s rebound suggested that bargain hunters were willing to step in at lower levels.</p>
<h3>9. January Layoffs Hit 108,435—Highest Since 2009—As Hiring Plans Collapse</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025, marking the highest January total since 2009 during the Great Recession&#39;s final months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. This marked the highest January total since 2009, when the economy was in the final months of the Great Recession. About 40% of January&#39;s layoff announcements were tied to Amazon and UPS, which outlined plans for 16,000 and 30,000 job cuts, respectively. Transportation had the highest level from a sector standpoint in January, due largely to plans from UPS to cut more than 30,000 workers.</p>
<p>Companies announced just 5,306 new hires in January, the lowest January since 2009, when Challenger began tracking such data. The collapse in hiring plans combined with elevated layoff announcements painted a troubling picture of labor market softening at the start of 2026. Initial jobless claims for the week ended January 31 totaled a seasonally adjusted 231,000, the highest since early December, though the spike likely had something to do with a brutal winter storm that disrupted business activity across much of the country.</p>
<p>The biggest reasons cited for the month&#39;s planned cutbacks were contract loss (30,784), followed by market and economic conditions (28,392), restructuring (20,044) or closures (12,738). Artificial intelligence was cited for 7,624 cuts in January and tariffs were cited for 294 cuts last month, highlighting how both technological disruption and trade policy are affecting employment decisions. The data contributed to the broader market selloff in early February, raising questions about the strength of the economic expansion and the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts if labor market conditions continue to deteriorate.</p>
<h3>10. Enphase Energy Soars 40% on Optimistic Solar Demand Outlook, Triggering Short Squeeze</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4-5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enphase Energy stock surged almost 40% after the company stated it is bullish on long-term solar demand, with strong quarterly earnings and optimistic forward guidance triggering a vicious short squeeze that also lifted solar sector peers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enphase Energy stock surged almost 40% in recent weeks after the company stated it is bullish on long-term solar demand. The surge occurred following strong quarterly earnings and optimistic forward guidance. The company reported fourth-quarter 2025 earnings of $0.71 per share, exceeding analyst expectations, and fourth-quarter revenue of $343.3 million, with U.S. sell-through jumping 21% quarter-over-quarter as homeowners rushed to install solar systems before the Section 25D tax credit expired.</p>
<p>The company predicted revenue between $270 million and $300 million, exceeding the consensus expectation of $260 million. CEO Badri Kothandaraman told investors the company is &quot;about 90% booked at the midpoint&quot; and expects Q1 to mark the bottom, with improvements building throughout 2026. The massive rally in Enphase stock suggests investors believe the worst is over for the residential solar market, with the combination of lean channel inventory, stabilizing demand, and new financing structures dramatically shifting sentiment.</p>
<p>Peers also rallied on the news, with SolarEdge climbing 13% and Sunrun jumping 12.2%, indicating that the optimism extended beyond Enphase to the broader residential solar sector. The rally was amplified by a short squeeze, as bearish investors who had bet against the stock were forced to cover their positions as prices rose, creating additional buying pressure. Despite the surge, Europe&#39;s ongoing weakness adds concern, as does the uncertain impact of tariffs on margins, and William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer cautioned that the U.S. solar market could still decline roughly 20% this year despite the optimistic tone from Enphase.</p>

<h2>Geopolitical News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Russia Launches Largest Aerial Assault of 2026 on Ukraine Energy Infrastructure</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia launched 71 missiles and 450 drones against Ukrainian power facilities in the most devastating energy attack of the year, leaving hundreds of thousands without heat during subzero temperatures immediately after a Trump-brokered energy truce expired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attack came just hours after the expiration of a brief pause in strikes on energy infrastructure that both Moscow and Kyiv had agreed to at the request of President Trump. Ukrainian President Zelensky accused Russia of using the pause not for diplomatic purposes but to stockpile missiles, then striking deliberately on the coldest days of the year when temperatures plunged to -20°C across much of the country.</p>
<p>DTEK, Ukraine&#39;s largest private energy provider, described the February 3 assault as &quot;the most severe&quot; since the start of 2026. More than 1,170 high-rise buildings in Kyiv lost heating, while a power plant in Kharkiv was damaged beyond repair, leaving 300,000 residents without electricity. In Odesa, over 50,000 people lost power as temperatures remained dangerously cold.</p>
<p>Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 38 missiles and 412 drones, but the strikes that got through caused catastrophic damage. DTEK&#39;s CEO noted that Ukraine has now lost approximately 70% of its generation capacity, with many civilians receiving only 3-4 hours of electricity daily. The energy crisis has driven an estimated 600,000 people to leave Kyiv since the war began.</p>
<h3>2. SpaceX Blocks Russian Forces&#39; Unauthorized Starlink Access After Ukraine&#39;s Plea</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX deactivated Starlink internet terminals used by Russian military forces in Ukraine after Kyiv provided evidence of &quot;hundreds&quot; of drone attacks guided by the satellite system, with Russian military bloggers confirming widespread outages across the front lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ukraine&#39;s defense ministry launched a verification of all Starlink terminals operating in the country after discovering that Moscow troops had been mounting Starlink systems on attack drones to strike deeper into Ukrainian territory. The unauthorized use began in September 2024, with the Rubikon company equipping Molniya strike drones with Starlink systems starting December 2025.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials created a &quot;white list&quot; of verified Starlink terminals used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and sent them to SpaceX, requesting that Musk keep these operational while shutting down all others in the theater. Pro-Russian military bloggers confirmed sweeping outages that weakened Moscow&#39;s ability to wage drone warfare and hindered coordination between units.</p>
<p>Musk responded on X that SpaceX&#39;s efforts to halt &quot;unauthorized&quot; Russian use appeared successful, posting &quot;Let us know if more needs to be done.&quot; The Ukrainian Defense Ministry confirmed that Russian terminals had been &quot;cut off,&quot; representing a significant blow to Russia&#39;s drone warfare capabilities just as it launched its largest aerial assault of the year.</p>
<h3>3. US-India Announce Landmark Trade Deal, Reducing Tariffs from 50% to 18%</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump announced a breakthrough trade agreement with India, immediately reducing tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% after Prime Minister Modi agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and commit to over $500 billion in American purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deal ended a year-long tariff standoff between the two nations, with Trump also dropping the separate 25% tariff imposed over India&#39;s Russian oil imports. Under the agreement, India pledged to eliminate tariffs on American industrial goods while being allowed to maintain protections for its agricultural sector. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal called it &quot;the father of all deals.&quot;</p>
<p>Indian markets surged on the news, with the Nifty 50 jumping nearly 5% and the rupee strengthening to 90.40—its best day since November 2022. Twenty-seven of 30 Sensex stocks traded positive as trade war fears eased. The 18% US tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors in the battle for American market access.</p>
<p>However, analysts cautioned that legally binding text has yet to materialize. Prime Minister Modi notably did not mention the Russian oil commitment or tariff elimination in his public response to Trump&#39;s announcement, raising questions about how the deal will be implemented and whether it can withstand political scrutiny in both countries.</p>
<h3>4. Australia and Indonesia Sign Historic Security Treaty for Defense Cooperation</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Australia and Indonesia signed a comprehensive security treaty establishing new military training facilities and closer defense cooperation, as Southeast Asia&#39;s largest economy aligns more closely with its southern neighbor amid rising great power competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed the agreement as &quot;a historic moment in our nations&#39; relationship,&quot; building upon a 2024 defense pact that pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region. The treaty creates a framework for joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and the development of training facilities in Indonesian territory.</p>
<p>The agreement comes as both nations navigate increasingly complex security dynamics, with China&#39;s military assertiveness in the South China Sea and the shifting priorities of the United States under President Trump creating pressure for regional powers to strengthen bilateral ties. Indonesia&#39;s strategic location straddling major shipping lanes makes the partnership particularly significant.</p>
<p>The treaty represents a significant warming of relations that were strained in previous decades over issues including East Timor and asylum seekers. Defense analysts note the agreement signals Indonesia&#39;s willingness to engage more deeply with traditional Western security partners while maintaining its non-aligned foreign policy stance, balancing relationships with both Washington and Beijing.</p>
<h3>5. Trump Administration Moves to Strip Job Protections from 50,000 Federal Workers</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management issued a final rule creating a new employment classification that will remove civil service protections from an estimated 50,000 &quot;policy-influencing&quot; federal employees, making them at-will workers who can be fired at the president&#39;s discretion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the &quot;Schedule Policy/Career&quot; classification, reclassified employees will lose the ability to appeal disciplinary actions, suspensions, demotions, or firings to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Starting March 9, these employees could be converted to at-will status at Trump&#39;s discretion, representing the most significant restructuring of federal employment since the civil service system was established.</p>
<p>The proposal received over 40,000 public comments during its 45-day comment period, with approximately 94% opposing the regulation. Unions representing federal workers condemned the move as an attempt to politicize the civil service and create a workforce loyal to the president rather than to their professional responsibilities and the public interest.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management data shows that 242,260 employees have left the federal workforce—voluntarily or involuntarily—since Trump took office for his second term. Combined with the earlier DOGE initiative that reduced the federal civilian workforce by 9% in 2025, the administration has achieved the most dramatic reduction in government employment since World War II.</p>
<h3>6. Xi Jinping and Trump Hold Phone Call, Discussing Taiwan and Trade Ahead of Summit</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Xi Jinping emphasized that Taiwan is &quot;the most important issue in China-U.S. relations&quot; during a phone call with President Trump, as the two leaders discussed trade tensions and geopolitical flashpoints ahead of a planned face-to-face meeting in April.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The call came after Xi held a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Putin confirmed plans to visit China in the first half of 2026. The timing highlighted Beijing&#39;s careful balancing act between maintaining its strategic partnership with Moscow while managing the increasingly complex relationship with Washington under Trump&#39;s trade-focused foreign policy.</p>
<p>Xi noted that over the past year the two countries have enjoyed sound communication following their successful meeting in Busan, which charted the direction for China-U.S. relations. However, he made clear that Taiwan remains a red line, declaring that &quot;Taiwan is China&#39;s territory&quot; and any American actions regarding the island could fundamentally damage bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The planned April summit will be closely watched for signs of progress on trade issues, particularly as Trump&#39;s tariff threats against allies and adversaries alike have created uncertainty in global markets. Western leaders including Canada&#39;s Prime Minister Mark Carney, the UK&#39;s Keir Starmer, and Germany&#39;s Friedrich Merz have all visited or plan to visit Beijing, reflecting China&#39;s central role in global economic and security calculations.</p>
<h3>7. ASEAN Refuses to Recognize Myanmar&#39;s Junta-Led Elections</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations issued a formal statement rejecting the legitimacy of elections held in Myanmar, marking a significant escalation in regional pressure on the military junta as the country approaches five years since the February 2021 coup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The elections, held in December 2025 and January 2026, were designed to provide a &quot;controlled veneer of legitimacy&quot; for the military government, according to analysts. However, the junta remains unable to assert full authority across the country, with resistance forces controlling significant territory and ongoing armed conflict preventing voting in many regions.</p>
<p>Myanmar, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, remains among the countries most susceptible to major civil unrest in Asia through 2026, according to intelligence assessments. Economic hardship, inflation, and widespread corruption continue to fuel protests, while armed resistance groups have made significant territorial gains against the military.</p>
<p>The media landscape in Myanmar continues to deteriorate as the nation approaches the fifth anniversary of the coup. New legislation across South Korea, Australia, and Indonesia affecting press freedom has drawn regional attention, while journalists in Myanmar face ongoing persecution, arbitrary detention, and violence for reporting on the conflict.</p>
<h3>8. Bangladesh Heads to Polls After Two Years of Political Upheaval</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bangladeshis are set to vote on February 12 in national elections that will determine the country&#39;s direction nearly two years after the July Uprising of 2024 that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a violent popular revolt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Islamic conservative party Jamaat-e-Islami announced it would maintain &quot;constructive and cooperative&quot; relations with neighboring countries including India as part of its election platform. The party&#39;s outreach to New Delhi represents an attempt to reassure regional powers concerned about political instability in the densely populated nation of 170 million.</p>
<p>The elections come amid continued civil unrest that intelligence analysts predict will persist into 2026. Economic hardship, inflation, and public anger over widespread corruption drove the protests that toppled Hasina&#39;s government, and these underlying conditions remain largely unaddressed nearly two years later.</p>
<p>Bangladesh&#39;s relationship with India has been strained since the 2024 uprising, with concerns in New Delhi about the treatment of Hindu minorities and the rise of Islamic political movements. The election results will significantly impact India&#39;s eastern security calculus and the broader dynamics of South Asian geopolitics.</p>
<h3>9. Trump Abandons Greenland Tariff Threats After European Backlash</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump canceled threatened tariffs on eight European nations that were scheduled to take effect on February 1, backing away from his demand that Denmark sell Greenland to the United States after the crisis sparked a significant deterioration in European public opinion of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump had initially announced a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, with threats to increase duties to 25% by June 1 unless Denmark agreed to cede Greenland. At the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, Trump reversed his position, pledging not to use force or tariffs to acquire the autonomous territory.</p>
<p>The crisis prompted Denmark to deploy hundreds of elite combat soldiers trained in arctic warfare to Greenland, including the Chief of the Royal Danish Army. A YouGov poll from February 2026 showed the standoff led to a significant increase in unfavorable views of the United States across Western Europe, potentially complicating future diplomatic initiatives.</p>
<p>Despite the de-escalation, Trump&#39;s broader tariff agenda continues to reshape transatlantic relations. The administration maintains 10% tariffs on European goods that took effect February 1 under separate trade disputes, with threats of further escalation if trade imbalances are not addressed to Washington&#39;s satisfaction.</p>
<h3>10. Ethiopia and Kenya Launch Joint Defense Committee Amid Regional Security Cooperation</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethiopia and Kenya concluded the inaugural meeting of their Joint Defence Committee, institutionalizing bilateral defense cooperation as the two nations emerge as primary drivers of East Africa&#39;s economic and security architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three-day meeting in Nairobi followed the signing of a Defense Cooperation Agreement that established a framework for coordinating military relations between the neighboring countries. The partnership aims to address shared security threats including terrorism, border instability, and the spillover effects of conflicts in Somalia and Sudan.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is positioning itself as Africa&#39;s &quot;green powerhouse,&quot; generating over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources through decades of investment in hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal infrastructure. Surplus electricity from large hydropower stations is increasingly exported to Kenya and Sudan under regional power trade agreements, strengthening economic interdependence.</p>
<p>The UN projects Ethiopia and Kenya will be the main drivers of East Africa&#39;s economic expansion in 2026, with the region&#39;s economy expected to grow by 5.8%—up from 5.4% in 2025—outperforming all other African sub-regions. This economic dynamism is enabling both countries to invest more heavily in defense and regional security initiatives.</p>
<h3>11. DRC Peace Process Launched with Former African Leaders as Facilitators</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>African nations appointed former Kenya president Uhuru Kenyatta, former Ethiopia prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and former Nigeria president Olusegun Obasanjo as facilitators of a new peace process for the Democratic Republic of Congo, as fighting continues in the mineral-rich east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appointment of the elder statesmen comes as Rwanda&#39;s President Kagame continues to defy international pressure over the DRC conflict, with the M23 rebel group—widely understood to receive Rwandan backing—controlling significant territory including the Rubaya coltan mines that produce 15% of the world&#39;s supply of the critical mineral used in electronics.</p>
<p>Kenya faces its own humanitarian crisis as a deepening drought pushes pastoralist families to the brink, with livestock losses spreading across the arid north. The dual crises of conflict in the DRC and climate-related disasters across the Horn of Africa are straining regional resources and diplomatic bandwidth.</p>
<p>The new peace process faces significant obstacles, as previous initiatives have failed to address the fundamental drivers of conflict: control over mineral wealth, ethnic tensions, and the competing interests of regional powers. The facilitators must navigate these challenges while managing pressure from Western nations and China, both of which have significant economic interests in the DRC&#39;s mineral sector.</p>
<h3>12. Super Bowl LX Set for Sunday as Seahawks Face Patriots in Epic Rematch</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare to face off at Levi&#39;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday in a Super Bowl rematch of their legendary 2015 clash, with both teams having finished the season at 14-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NFL Honors ceremony on Thursday announced Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford as the league&#39;s Most Valuable Player, while the 2026 Hall of Fame class was revealed: Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly, Adam Vinatieri, and Roger Craig. The class includes three of the NFL&#39;s all-time greats at their positions.</p>
<p>Seattle enters as 4.5-point favorites, with quarterback Sam Darnold and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba leading an explosive offense. Bad Bunny will headline the halftime show, with Charlie Puth performing the national anthem and Green Day opening the ceremony. Brandi Carlile will sing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and Coco Jones will perform &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing.&quot;</p>
<p>The game carries enormous stakes for both franchises. A Seahawks victory would help erase the bitter memory of Malcolm Butler&#39;s game-winning interception at the goal line in Super Bowl XLIX. For New England, a win would mark the Patriots&#39; seventh championship and validate the team&#39;s complete rebuild since Tom Brady&#39;s departure.</p>
<h3>13. European Leaders Face Mounting Unpopularity as Reform Agendas Stall</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>France, Germany, and the United Kingdom entered 2026 with historically unpopular governments, with polling showing just 18% of Britons viewing Keir Starmer favorably and only 16% of French respondents holding a positive view of Emmanuel Macron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Germany&#39;s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in May 2025 after February&#39;s snap election, began his term with just 38% approval—which had fallen to 32% by December. His coalition faces pressure from five upcoming state elections where the far-right Alternative for Germany is expected to gain seats, limiting his ability to pursue controversial reforms.</p>
<p>France entered 2026 for the second consecutive year without an approved budget after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu&#39;s minority government collapsed under pressure from both left and right. A new budget agreement is expected by late February or March, but the political paralysis has limited the government&#39;s ability to respond to economic challenges or the Trump administration&#39;s trade demands.</p>
<p>In the UK, domestic pressure grows on Starmer to pursue closer economic integration with the European Union, including potentially joining the customs union. However, official talks between London and Brussels have gone nowhere, leaving Britain isolated between an uninterested Europe and a Trump administration focused on bilateral trade confrontation.</p>
<h3>14. Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana to Lead Latin American Oil Production Surge</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latin America&#39;s three emerging oil powers—Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana—are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing a potential 300,000 bpd contribution from Venezuela as the region reshapes global energy markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brazil leads the surge, with production expected to exceed 4.2 million barrels per day this year. The increase is specifically linked to ramp-ups and start-ups of new floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels in the country&#39;s prolific pre-salt offshore fields. Petrobras and international partners continue to invest heavily in the deep-water Santos and Campos basins.</p>
<p>Argentina&#39;s shale revolution is accelerating, with investment in the Vaca Muerta formation expected to drive Latin American shale sector spending to nearly $11 billion in 2026, up from $9.4 billion in 2025. The country&#39;s vast unconventional resources are attracting international capital despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges.</p>
<p>Despite sanctions relief, Venezuela&#39;s oil output is projected to lag regional competitors through 2030. Years of underinvestment, mismanagement, and the departure of international partners have left the country&#39;s once-mighty oil industry struggling to ramp production, even as global demand and prices create incentives for increased output.</p>
<h3>15. India Assumes BRICS Presidency, Pushes Local Currency Trade Agenda</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>India took over the BRICS chairship for the fourth time with a focus on &quot;Building for Resilience, Innovation, Cooperation and Sustainability,&quot; promoting trade in local currencies while carefully distancing itself from proposals for a common BRICS currency that have raised concerns in Washington.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Modi announced he would give &quot;a new form&quot; to BRICS during India&#39;s tenure, emphasizing policy coordination, development finance, trade facilitation, and reform of global institutional governance. India&#39;s Rupee-Rouble trade with Russia is estimated to now account for over 90% of bilateral commerce, demonstrating the growing viability of de-dollarized transactions.</p>
<p>India&#39;s BRICS presidency gains particular significance amid global geopolitical turbulence, with New Delhi navigating complex relationships with both the United States—following the landmark trade deal announced on February 2—and its traditional strategic partner Russia. The balancing act requires careful diplomacy as Washington increases pressure on nations to reduce ties with Moscow.</p>
<p>The expanded BRICS+ grouping now includes Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Iran, creating a coalition that represents a significant share of global population, GDP, and energy production. India&#39;s leadership will be tested by managing diverse interests within the group while advancing its own strategic objectives in an increasingly multipolar world.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Alphabet Announces $185 Billion AI Spending Plan, Doubling 2025 Investment</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&#39;s parent company reported record fourth-quarter earnings while projecting capital expenditures of up to $185 billion for 2026—more than double its $91.4 billion spend in 2025—as CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the &quot;staggering&quot; scale of AI infrastructure investment is keeping him up at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alphabet beat Wall Street expectations, reporting earnings per share of $2.82 versus $2.63 estimated and revenue of $113.83 billion versus $111.43 billion expected. The company&#39;s annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time, with net income growing 15% to $132.2 billion. Google Cloud revenues surged 48% to $17.7 billion, driven by enterprise AI solutions.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter. Alphabet achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations and efficiency improvements. Pichai emphasized that AI is driving Search revenue growth as users engage with Google&#39;s AI mode features.</p>
<p>Despite the strong earnings, shares traded flat as investors weighed the massive spending commitment. The $185 billion guidance represents the largest capital expenditure plan ever announced by a technology company, raising questions about returns on AI infrastructure investment even as competitors race to match Alphabet&#39;s spending.</p>
<h3>2. Waymo Raises $16 Billion at $126 Billion Valuation, Plans Global Robotaxi Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alphabet&#39;s autonomous driving unit secured the largest investment ever in an autonomous vehicle company, with Dragoneer, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital leading a round that values Waymo at $126 billion—more than double its valuation from the October 2024 funding round.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The investor roster reads like a who&#39;s who of Silicon Valley: Andreessen Horowitz, Mubadala Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, T. Rowe Price, BDT &amp; MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek all participated. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.</p>
<p>Waymo plans to use the capital to expand to over 20 new cities in 2026, including its first international markets. Tokyo and London are confirmed as the company&#39;s initial overseas destinations, marking a significant milestone in the global deployment of autonomous vehicle technology. The expansion will require substantial investment in local regulatory approvals, mapping, and support infrastructure.</p>
<p>The massive valuation reflects investor confidence in Waymo&#39;s technological lead over competitors following General Motors&#39; decision to shut down its Cruise robotaxi unit. With Tesla still struggling to deliver on autonomous driving promises and Chinese competitors facing geopolitical headwinds, Waymo appears positioned to capture the lion&#39;s share of the emerging robotaxi market.</p>
<h3>3. Big Tech AI Spending Approaches $700 Billion as Hyperscalers Double Down</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The four major cloud hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—announced combined 2026 capital expenditure plans approaching $700 billion, up from $350 billion in 2025, as the AI infrastructure arms race enters a new phase of intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta intends to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion in capex for 2026, joining Alphabet&#39;s $175-185 billion commitment. Microsoft and Amazon are also scaling investments dramatically, though exact figures vary. The spending surge reflects fierce competition to secure GPU capacity from Nvidia and build data center infrastructure capable of training and serving increasingly powerful AI models.</p>
<p>Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion this year through debt and equity financing to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity for its largest customers including AMD and Meta. The company is selling $25 billion in investment-grade bonds as part of the effort, highlighting how the AI boom is reshaping corporate finance across the technology sector.</p>
<p>The massive spending is taking a significant toll on cash reserves. Analysts note that while revenue growth remains strong, free cash flow is being consumed by infrastructure investment at an unprecedented rate. The question of whether this spending will generate adequate returns remains the central uncertainty for technology investors.</p>
<h3>4. Disney Experiences Division Crosses $10 Billion in Quarterly Revenue for First Time</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney Company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates, with its theme parks, resorts, and cruises division posting record revenue, though shares fell 7% after investors focused on slowing streaming growth and succession uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall revenue for the quarter was roughly $26 billion, up 5% year over year, with the experiences division generating $10 billion for the first time in history. Domestic theme parks recorded $6.91 billion in revenue while international parks reported $1.75 billion—each up 7% compared with the prior-year period. The cruise line expansion is contributing increasingly to the segment&#39;s performance.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter was $2.48 billion, or $1.34 per share, down from $2.64 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items including tax charges related to a deal with Fubo, Disney reported $1.63 in earnings per share, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.58.</p>
<p>Despite the strong operational performance, Disney shares came under pressure as investors digested news about CEO Bob Iger&#39;s succession timeline. The company reaffirmed its plan to repurchase $7 billion in stock for fiscal 2026, projected double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and expects $19 billion in cash provided by operations—but questions about leadership transition overshadowed the results.</p>
<h3>5. Tesla Reports First-Ever Annual Revenue Decline as Musk Pivots to AI and Robotics</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tesla reported 2025 full-year revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3% from $97.7 billion the previous year—the first annual decline in the electric vehicle maker&#39;s history—as CEO Elon Musk announced plans to end Model S and Model X production to make room for Optimus humanoid robots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations with adjusted EPS of 50 cents versus 45 cents estimated on revenue of $24.90 billion. However, net profit fell 61% to $840 million for the quarter, bringing full-year profit to $3.8 billion—down sharply from $7.1 billion in 2024. The margin compression reflects intensified price competition in the global EV market.</p>
<p>During the earnings call, Musk outlined a dramatic strategic transformation: Tesla will transition from an EV manufacturer to &quot;a full-blown real-world AI and robotics company.&quot; Model S and Model X production will end in Q2 2026, with Fremont factory space converted to manufacture Optimus humanoid robots. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said investors should expect approximately $20 billion in capital expenditure for 2026.</p>
<p>Musk claimed Tesla&#39;s robotaxi service has been &quot;rolled out in a few cities&quot; and will be &quot;very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US.&quot; The bold prediction drew skepticism from analysts who noted regulatory hurdles and the company&#39;s history of missed autonomous driving timelines. Wall Street&#39;s median year-end target implies roughly 10% upside from current levels.</p>
<h3>6. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Earnings as Weight Loss Drug Demand Soars</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pharmaceutical giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, crushing Wall Street expectations as blockbuster demand for weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro drives unprecedented revenue growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly guided to 2026 revenue between $80 billion and $83 billion, dramatically exceeding analyst expectations of $77.62 billion. The company projects adjusted earnings between $33.50 and $35 per share, compared with the $33.23 consensus estimate. The guidance implies continued market share gains in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 drug category.</p>
<p>The earnings report contrasted sharply with Novo Nordisk&#39;s struggles earlier in the week, as Lilly appeared to be winning the competitive battle for weight loss drug market share. Production capacity investments are paying off, allowing Lilly to meet surging demand while Novo Nordisk faces supply constraints that have limited its growth.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s success reflects broader transformation in the pharmaceutical industry, as GLP-1 drugs emerge as potentially the largest drug class in history. Beyond obesity and diabetes, trials are exploring applications in cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other conditions—expanding the total addressable market beyond current analyst models.</p>
<h3>7. Pfizer Beats Estimates Despite Declining COVID Revenue, Reaffirms Modest Outlook</h3>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pfizer reported fourth-quarter results that topped analyst expectations even as demand for its COVID-19 products continued to decline, while reaffirming a 2026 outlook that projects essentially flat revenue compared to 2025 levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company expects 2026 adjusted profit between $2.80 and $3.00 per share, with revenue totaling $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. The guidance reflects the challenges of managing a post-pandemic portfolio as COVID vaccine and treatment revenues fade while the company works to develop new growth drivers.</p>
<p>Pfizer&#39;s results stand in stark contrast to the explosive growth reported by competitors like Eli Lilly, highlighting the divergent fortunes of pharmaceutical companies depending on their exposure to the GLP-1 weight loss drug category. Pfizer&#39;s attempts to enter the obesity market have faced setbacks, leaving the company without a clear path to matching rivals&#39; growth rates.</p>
<p>The company continues to invest in its oncology pipeline and other therapeutic areas, but investors remain skeptical about the timeline for meaningful revenue contributions. The modest guidance keeps Pfizer in a transition period as it seeks to replace pandemic-era profits with sustainable new product revenues.</p>
<h3>8. Mortgage Rates Fall to Three-Year Lows as Housing Activity Improves</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.11%, the lowest level in more than three years, driving a surge in purchase applications and refinance activity as the spring selling season approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freddie Mac reported the 15-year fixed mortgage averaged 5.50%, while some lenders offered rates below 6% for well-qualified borrowers. The decline followed the Federal Reserve&#39;s decision to hold rates steady while signaling openness to future cuts. Analysts at Morgan Stanley project rates could hit 5.75% later this year if inflation continues to moderate.</p>
<p>Purchase and refinance applications have jumped year-over-year as lower rates create opportunities for both first-time buyers and existing homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments. Mortgage industry experts note that housing activity &quot;is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season&quot; after two years of elevated rate headwinds.</p>
<p>A recent analysis revealed that a surprising share of homeowners still carry mortgage rates above 5%, creating significant refinance demand as rates decline. The combination of pent-up buyer demand, falling rates, and limited inventory could produce competitive spring housing markets despite affordability challenges persisting in many metropolitan areas.</p>
<h3>9. CFPB Secures Emergency Funding Through March After Court Rejects Shutdown Attempt</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau obtained $145 million in emergency funding from the Federal Reserve after a federal judge ruled in December that the Trump administration cannot close a congressionally-created agency without an act of Congress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acting Director Russell Vought had attempted to effectively shut down the CFPB in February 2025 by ordering staff to stop work on proposed rules, suspend finalized regulations, halt investigations, and cease supervision and examination activities. Most staff were placed on administrative leave as the administration sought to eliminate the consumer watchdog agency.</p>
<p>The December 30, 2025 court ruling rejected Vought&#39;s argument that he could unilaterally close the agency, ordering the CFPB to remain funded and operational. The $145 million transfer from the Federal Reserve Board will allow the agency to continue operations through at least March 2026, though its long-term future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy groups have warned that the ongoing attempts to neutralize the CFPB leave Americans more vulnerable to predatory lending, debt collection abuses, and financial fraud. Industry groups have welcomed the reduced regulatory oversight, arguing the agency exceeded its statutory authority under previous leadership.</p>
<h3>10. GM Projects $4 Billion in Tariff Costs for 2026 Despite Increased US Production</h3>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>General Motors announced plans to top Ford in US vehicle production while warning that tariff costs will reach between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2026, highlighting the significant financial burden of trade policy on American automakers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CEO Mary Barra outlined the production targets as part of the company&#39;s 2025 earnings report and 2026 guidance. The expansion of domestic manufacturing is partly designed to mitigate tariff exposure, but vehicles and components that cross borders multiple times during production still face significant duties under current trade policies.</p>
<p>The tariff burden comes as GM navigates the costly transition to electric vehicles while maintaining profitability in its traditional internal combustion engine business. The company must balance investment in next-generation technology against the headwinds of trade policy and increasingly competitive global EV markets.</p>
<p>Ford is scheduled to report earnings on February 10 and is expected to face similar tariff challenges. Both Detroit automakers have warned that tariff costs are being passed along to consumers through higher vehicle prices, contributing to affordability challenges that have dampened new car demand despite strong consumer interest.</p>
<h3>11. Semiconductor Industry Enters 2nm Manufacturing Race as AI Demand Strains Supply</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TSMC&#39;s 2nm process entered mass production with strong yields as the company battles Samsung and Intel for AI chip supremacy, with Apple reportedly exploring alternative foundries as capacity constraints force diversification of the global semiconductor supply chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TSMC sees its AI revenue growing at a mid- to high-50% compound annual growth rate through 2029, with Nvidia now surpassing Apple as the company&#39;s largest customer.

<h2>Fusion Energy</h2>
<h3>General Fusion Sets World Record with 600 Million Neutrons Per Second - <em>Jan 28, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Canadian company General Fusion achieves highest neutron output ever recorded for Magnetized Target Fusion, validated by IAEA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion, a Canadian company specializing in nuclear fusion technology, has set a world record by generating 600 million neutrons per second using Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF). This achievement was recognized and validated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and represents a crucial step toward demonstrating the viability of nuclear fusion as a sustainable and scalable energy source.</p>
<p>During compression, the plasma density rose to about 190 times the starting value and the magnetic field that holds it in place grew more than 13 times stronger, while the plasma stayed stable instead of tearing itself apart and delivered repeatable bursts of fusion neutrons. What sets General Fusion&#39;s method apart from traditional fusion techniques is its unique approach involving a liquid metal liner, where high-powered pistons compress the liquid metal mechanically, rapidly compressing plasma within a spherical tokamak.</p>
<p>Dr. Michel Laberge, founder and Chief Scientist of General Fusion, stated: &quot;This is the first-ever compression of a spherical tokamak using a collapsing metal liner. These results strengthen MTF as a viable path to commercial fusion energy.&quot; The results come from the long-running Plasma Compression Science experiment series, whose data have been reviewed by independent scientists and published in the journal Nuclear Fusion. The lessons from these experiments feed directly into Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), the larger demonstration device the company has built in Richmond, British Columbia.</p>
<h3>General Fusion Announces $1 Billion SPAC Merger, First Pure-Play Fusion IPO - <em>Feb 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General Fusion becomes first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion through SPAC deal, signaling growing investor confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion is set to become the first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion, signaling growing investor confidence in the field. The company has agreed to merge with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. III in a roughly $1 billion SPAC deal announced January 21, 2026.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s piston-driven, liquid-lithium approach challenges magnet- and laser-based fusion designs while aiming to reduce material degradation. Instead of using powerful magnets or lasers, the model uses mechanical pistons to contain plasma within a liquid lithium shell, offering a potentially more practical path to commercial fusion power.</p>
<p>This IPO represents a watershed moment for the fusion industry, which has collectively raised over $7.1 billion to date. Commonwealth Fusion Systems leads funding at nearly $3 billion following its $863 million Series B2 in August 2025, but General Fusion&#39;s public offering opens a new avenue for retail and institutional investors to participate in the fusion energy revolution.</p>
<h3>China&#39;s EAST Tokamak Achieves &quot;Density-Free Regime&quot; Breakthrough - <em>Jan 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese scientists break through the long-theorized plasma density limit, removing a major obstacle toward fusion ignition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists working with China&#39;s fully superconducting Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) have successfully reached a long-theorized &quot;density-free regime&quot; in fusion plasma experiments. In this groundbreaking state, the plasma remains stable even when its density rises far beyond traditional limits that have constrained tokamak operations for decades.</p>
<p>The experiment, published in Science Advances, confirmed that plasma can remain stable even at extreme densities if its interaction with the reactor walls is carefully controlled. This finding effectively removes the Greenwald density limit, a major obstacle that has slowed progress toward practical fusion energy generation for years. Using a newly developed high-density operating approach on EAST, the team showed that plasma density can be pushed well beyond long-accepted empirical limits without triggering violent instabilities.</p>
<p>The breakthrough demonstrates that with proper wall conditioning and plasma control techniques, tokamaks can operate at much higher performance levels than previously thought possible, bringing commercial fusion power closer to reality. This research could fundamentally change how future fusion reactors are designed and operated.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan Strategic Fusion Partnership Launched - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering establish collaboration to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate commercialization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering launched a strategic partnership to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate deployment of commercial fusion power. The agreement could serve as a model for joint public-private investment and international collaboration to develop fusion technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Collaboration between U.S. and U.K. research teams has already yielded crucial findings. Both machines confirmed that energy confinement scales more favorably to the expected operating regime in fusion pilot plants in spherical tokamaks than in conventional designs—a finding that could determine the shape of future commercial fusion plants.</p>
<p>This international cooperation reflects growing recognition that fusion energy development benefits from shared resources and expertise across borders. With multiple countries racing toward commercial fusion, partnerships like this one help distribute both the costs and the knowledge gained from cutting-edge experiments.</p>
<h3>Commonwealth Fusion Systems Partners with NVIDIA and Siemens for AI-Powered Development - <em>Jan 6, 8:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CFS announces partnership leveraging AI-powered digital twins to compress years of fusion experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems has announced a major partnership with NVIDIA and Siemens to accelerate the development of commercial fusion energy using artificial intelligence. The collaboration will create AI-powered digital twins of fusion systems to dramatically speed up the development process.</p>
<p>&quot;CFS will be able to compress years of manual experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization using the digital infrastructure developed by NVIDIA and Siemens,&quot; said Bob Mumgaard, Co-Founder and CEO of CFS. Leveraging data from Siemens and an AI platform from Nvidia, CFS is creating what it calls a &quot;digital twin&quot; of its demonstration machine to speed progress toward commercial fusion.</p>
<p>CFS aims to hit a key technical milestone in 2027—generating net energy at its SPARC demonstration reactor in Massachusetts—before producing commercial-scale fusion energy in the early 2030s. The company has raised nearly $3 billion to date, making it the best-funded private fusion venture in the world.</p>

<h2>Human Genetics &amp; Gene Science</h2>
<h3>First Patient Dosed with CRISPR Epigenetic Silencer for Hepatitis B - <em>Jan 30, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio begins Phase 1/2 trial of CRMA-1001, a CRISPR-derived therapy that silences hepatitis B virus without cutting the genome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio has dosed the first patient with CRMA-1001, an innovative CRISPR-Cas–derived epigenetic silencer designed to treat chronic hepatitis B infection. Unlike traditional gene editing, this therapy methylates viral DNA without making cuts to the genome, representing a fundamentally new approach to treating viral diseases.</p>
<p>The open-label Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and antiviral durability of the treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Regulatory approvals have enabled the study to expand to the UK and New Zealand, broadening the international scope of this promising research. CRMA-1001 specifically targets HBV cccDNA and integrated viral DNA, aiming to achieve a functional cure by silencing the virus&#39;s ability to replicate.</p>
<p>This represents a new paradigm in treating viral infections, using precision epigenetic tools to silence viral genes while leaving the host genome intact. With approximately 296 million people living with chronic hepatitis B worldwide, a functional cure could transform global public health outcomes for this persistent viral infection.</p>
<h3>CRISPR Breakthrough: Turning Genes On Without Cutting DNA - <em>Jan 4, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists develop safer gene therapy approach using epigenetic editing to reactivate silenced genes without making permanent cuts to DNA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists at UNSW Sydney have developed a revolutionary new form of CRISPR technology that can turn genes back on without cutting DNA. Instead of making permanent edits to the genetic code, this approach removes chemical tags (methyl groups) that act like molecular anchors, silencing genes.</p>
<p>The work confirms that these epigenetic tags actively silence genes, settling a long-running scientific debate in the field. Rather than cutting DNA, the new technique uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups, releasing the genetic brakes that keep certain genes switched off. One key target is the fetal globin gene, which helps deliver oxygen before birth.</p>
<p>Reactivating the fetal globin gene after birth could help bypass defects in the adult globin gene that cause Sickle Cell disease. Scientists say this breakthrough opens the door to powerful new therapies with fewer unintended side effects, potentially transforming the gene therapy landscape and making treatments accessible to more patients who currently have limited options.</p>
<h3>Personalized CRISPR Therapy Team Plans Landmark Clinical Trial - <em>Jan 28, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers behind KJ Muldoon&#39;s historic treatment plan new trial type that could treat multiple rare diseases with as few as 5-10 patients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team behind the world&#39;s first personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy is planning an entirely new type of clinical trial to make this technology more accessible to patients with rare diseases. Researchers at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine created a bespoke in vivo CRISPR therapy for infant KJ Muldoon in just six months.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to launch a clinical trial in 2026 that can enroll patients with any of 7 different urea cycle disorders, caused by any variant in any of 7 genes that can be corrected by the same type of gene editor used in KJ&#39;s therapy. Successful treatment of a small number of participants—as few as 5-10—might be sufficient for FDA approval.</p>
<p>This landmark case paves the way for a future with on-demand gene-editing therapies for individuals with rare, until-now untreatable genetic diseases. The approach could fundamentally change how rare disease treatments are developed and approved, making personalized medicine a reality for thousands of patients with ultra-rare conditions.</p>
<h3>CRISPR CAR-T Therapy Shows 70% Complete Response in Cancer Trials - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy zugo-cel achieves remarkable results in B-cell lymphoma and autoimmune disease trials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy, zugo-cel (CTX112), is showing remarkable early promise in clinical trials for both autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), a 100M-cell dose induced rapid B-cell depletion and clinical improvement.</p>
<p>Importantly, the therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) observed. In relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma patients, a higher 600M-cell dose achieved an impressive complete response rate of 70%.</p>
<p>These results position zugo-cel as a potential breakthrough in both oncology and autoimmune disease treatment, with the allogeneic (off-the-shelf) approach potentially making CAR-T therapy accessible to far more patients than current autologous approaches that require manufacturing cells from each individual patient.</p>
<h3>iECURE&#39;s Gene Editing Treatment Receives Dual Fast-Track Designations - <em>Jan 21, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ECUR-506 secures both FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation and UK Innovation Passport for treating neonatal conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>iECURE&#39;s ECUR-506 gene editing treatment has received significant regulatory recognition, securing both the US FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation and a UK Innovation Passport. These designations will accelerate the development pathway for this promising therapy targeting severe neonatal conditions.</p>
<p>The treatment targets severe neonatal conditions where early intervention is critical. The dual regulatory fast-tracking demonstrates international recognition of the therapy&#39;s potential to address unmet medical needs in some of the most vulnerable patient populations.</p>
<p>RMAT designation provides intensive FDA guidance, eligibility for priority review, and potential accelerated approval, while the UK Innovation Passport offers similar benefits in the British regulatory system, positioning ECUR-506 for rapid global development. This dual recognition underscores growing momentum for gene editing therapies treating conditions that were previously considered untreatable.</p>

Mercedes-Benz has selected this platform for use in its CLA model, marking one of the first major automotive adoptions of NVIDIA&#39;s new physical AI stack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boston Dynamics&#39; Atlas robot began its first field test at Hyundai&#39;s plant near Savannah, Georgia on January 4, 2026. Standing 5&#39;9&quot; and weighing 200 pounds, Atlas autonomously performs tasks in a parts warehouse without human assistance. At CES, Boston Dynamics announced manufacturing plans for 30,000 units per year, signaling the beginning of large-scale humanoid robot deployment.</p>

<h1>Weekly Finance Briefing</h1>
<p><strong>Week of January 27 - February 2, 2026</strong></p>
<p><em>Research Generated: February 3, 2026, 11:45 AM PST</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Inflation &amp; Finance Metrics</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady in Split Decision Amid Political Pressure - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The FOMC voted 10-2 to keep interest rates at 3.50%-3.75%, ending a string of three consecutive quarter-point cuts as Chair Powell described the economy as on &quot;firm footing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, January 28, marking the central bank&#39;s first pause since July 2025. The decision came after three consecutive quarter-point reductions delivered between September and December 2025, which Powell characterized as having moved policy toward a &quot;neutral&quot; range. Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented from the decision, favoring continued cuts.</p>
<p>In his post-meeting press conference, Chair Jerome Powell stated that &quot;if you look at the incoming data since the last meeting, there is clear improvement in the outlook for growth. Inflation performed about as expected, and some of the labor market data came in suggesting evidence of stabilization.&quot; Powell noted there was &quot;broad support on the Committee for holding today,&quot; including among non-voting members, though some wanted to continue cutting.</p>
<p>Futures markets now expect at most two quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2026, with the first anticipated in June and a second in the fall, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The decision comes as President Trump announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would replace Powell when his term ends in May.</p>
<h3>Government Shutdown Delays Key January Jobs Report - <em>Feb 2, 10:30 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the January employment report will not be released as scheduled on February 6 after lawmakers failed to reach funding agreement following controversial DHS enforcement actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government partially shut down on January 31 after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding, an impasse sparked by outcry over the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota—specifically the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6.</p>
<p>In addition to the January jobs report, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) release for December 2025 and the Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for December 2025 will also be rescheduled. The BLS stated that &quot;due to the partial federal government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will suspend data collection, processing, and dissemination.&quot;</p>
<p>Signs from Capitol Hill suggest this shutdown will be brief—unlike the 43-day shutdown that concluded November 12. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he anticipates passing funding legislation early this week. Unlike in last year&#39;s shutdown, which resulted in major inflation and unemployment data going uncollected for October, the relevant data has already been collected. Economists had expected the January jobs report to show employers added 80,000 jobs last month, up from 50,000 in December.</p>
<h3>Tariff Costs Set to Hit Consumers Harder as Businesses Pass Along Price Increases - <em>Jan 30, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After absorbing roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, businesses are now passing those costs to consumers, with the figure expected to flip to just 20% business absorption later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump&#39;s tariffs are increasingly impacting consumer prices as businesses exhaust their pretariff inventory and begin passing costs to shoppers. According to JPMorgan analysis, businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that ratio could shrink to just 20% later this year as companies implement further price hikes. Goldman Sachs economists estimated that tariffs caused inflation to increase by half a percentage point in 2025.</p>
<p>According to NBER research, since President Trump announced broad tariff measures starting in the spring, the import taxes increased the inflation rate by 0.7 percentage points between March and August. The annual inflation rate for August—which was 2.9%—would have been 2.2% without tariffs. Before Trump took office, the U.S. average effective tariff rate was 2.4%, according to estimates from the Yale Budget Lab. At the end of 2025, it was 16.8%.</p>
<p>Consumer goods with the steepest price increases since Trump took office tend to be those with lower profit margins. Prices of heavily imported items—including tomatoes and coffee—have changed more significantly than most other goods. The United States collected $187 billion more in tariff revenue in 2025 than it did in 2024, a nearly 200% increase. According to Budget Lab research, tariffs represent an income loss of $1,700 for the average U.S. household.</p>
<h3>Warren Report: Households Paid $2,120 More Due to Inflation in 2025 - <em>Jan 30, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Warren&#39;s team found year-on-year inflation equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, with lower-income families facing costs exceeding 5% of their income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren released a report through the Senate Banking Committee detailing how households paid an estimated $2,120 more in 2025 because of inflation—including an estimated $123 more on electricity bills and an estimated $150 more for groceries. The year-on-year inflation increase equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, assuming they purchased the same goods and services in 2025 that they bought in 2024.</p>
<p>Higher prices have fallen hardest on those least able to afford them. In 2025, the bottom 20% of households faced roughly $950 in additional inflation-related costs—more than 5% of their estimated income. In contrast, although the top 20% paid more in absolute dollars, those costs amounted to just 2% of their estimated income. The report documents sharp price increases for everyday grocery staples, including coffee and beef prices, which are up a respective 29% and 21% since January 2025.</p>
<p>The report comes as the annual inflation rate in the United States was 2.7% for the 12 months ending December, according to U.S. Labor Department data released on January 13, 2026. While inflation is off its 40-year highs from 2022, the rate is still running closer to 3% than the Fed&#39;s 2% goal, causing concern among some FOMC officials who either want rate cuts paused or eliminated until there&#39;s more evidence that price increases are easing.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Case Threatens Fed Independence as Powell Calls It &quot;Most Important&quot; in 113 Years - <em>Jan 21, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments in the Lisa Cook case, while separately facing DOJ subpoenas over building renovations that he characterizes as &quot;pretexts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments on January 21 in a landmark case addressing whether President Donald Trump can fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell called the case &quot;perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed&#39;s 113-year history,&quot; adding that &quot;as I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn&#39;t attend.&quot; The case tests the legal boundaries of presidential power and the independence of the central bank.</p>
<p>Trump cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements in applying for home mortgages. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term. All three former living Fed chairs—Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen—signed on to a legal brief arguing against Cook&#39;s removal, along with a group of former Treasury secretaries and chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>The Trump administration also hit the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on January 9, initiating a criminal investigation into Powell for his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June regarding cost overruns at Federal Reserve building renovations. Powell stated: &quot;This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of federal reserve buildings. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.&quot;</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Developments</h2>
<h3>Bitcoin Crashes Below $75,000 in Weekend Bloodbath, Marking Fourth Consecutive Monthly Decline - <em>Feb 2, 9:15 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since April 2025, wiping roughly $800 billion in market value since its October peak and knocking it out of the global top 10 assets as leveraged long positions were liquidated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin plunged below $75,000 on Sunday, February 2, extending a drawdown that has wiped more than 30% off the value of the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency since its October 2025 peak of approximately $126,000. The move marked Bitcoin&#39;s lowest level since April 2025, when markets were rattled by U.S. tariff announcements. The drop capped Bitcoin&#39;s fourth consecutive monthly decline and its longest losing streak in seven years.</p>
<p>A confluence of factors drove the crash: President Trump&#39;s nomination of Kevin Warsh—a known monetary hawk—to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair landed as a shock to markets, immediately resetting expectations for rate cuts. The U.S. dollar surged, rate-cut odds for the first half of 2026 collapsed, and risk assets were repriced lower. Disappointing earnings from Magnificent Seven tech companies cracked the AI narrative, while a violent precious metals unwind added to risk-off sentiment.</p>
<p>Data from Glassnode confirms that Bitcoin fell below its True Market Mean—currently at $80,500—for the first time in 30 months. Historically, a breach of this level marks a switch from a bullish cycle to a medium-term bearish trend. Compass Point analysts say the crypto bear market is in its &quot;final innings,&quot; with bitcoin likely to bottom between $60,000 and $68,000 absent a broader U.S. equity bear market. They warn that the $70,000 to $80,000 range is an &quot;air pocket&quot; with little structural support.</p>
<h3>January 2026 Bitcoin ETF Outflows Hit $1.6 Billion as Institutional Appetite Evaporates - <em>Jan 31, 4:30 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted their worst month since launch with $1.61 billion in net outflows, while BlackRock&#39;s IBIT alone shed over $500 million in a single day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>January 2026 proved to be a brutal reset month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posting -$1.61 billion in net outflows for the month. Total monthly traded value reached $86.99 billion, with $106.96 billion in total net assets at month end. The ETF bid that underpinned Bitcoin through much of 2025 has effectively evaporated.</p>
<p>U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs suffered heavy redemptions on January 29, with nearly $1 billion yanked in a single session. Investors withdrew $817.9 million from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs on January 29, the largest daily outflow since November 20. BlackRock&#39;s IBIT bore the brunt of redemptions, shedding $317.8 million, while Fidelity&#39;s FBTC lost $168 million and Grayscale&#39;s GBTC saw $119.4 million exit.</p>
<p>The 11 spot ETFs cumulatively registered a net outflow of $1.09 billion in December after a much steeper $3.48 billion in November. That amounts to a combined two-month redemption worth $4.57 billion—the largest since their debut in January 2024. On the Ethereum side, January 30 showed net ETF flow of -$252.87 million, with $1.80 billion traded value and $15.86 billion total net assets.</p>
<h3>$2.5 Billion Liquidation Cascade Amplifies Crypto Downturn - <em>Jan 31, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Forced deleveraging triggered over $2.5 billion in liquidations in a single 24-hour period, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion as overleveraged traders were forced to close positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of forced selling was staggering, with more than $2 billion of bitcoin long and short positions liquidated since Thursday, January 30. This wasn&#39;t a gradual correction—it was a violent deleveraging wave that forced prices down sharply. Market structure evidence supports a liquidity and positioning driven move into month end.</p>
<p>In a single 24-hour period, $2.53 billion in futures liquidations occurred, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion. Ethereum was the hardest hit, accounting for nearly half of the total carnage with $1.14 billion in liquidations. Forced deleveraging acted as a direct transmission mechanism, with estimated 24-hour liquidations exceeding $1.7 billion around January 30, followed by an estimated $2.5 billion on January 31.</p>
<p>Bitcoin fell about 12% in the last seven days, wiping off more than $200 billion in market value and triggering over $2 billion in forced liquidations, creating a cascading effect that amplified the downturn. According to analysts, the outflows coincided with a broader risk-off sentiment driven by hawkish Fed expectations and geopolitical tensions, with ETF flows reacting to price weakness rather than leading it.</p>
<h3>Senate Agriculture Committee Advances Landmark Crypto Regulation Bill - <em>Jan 29, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In a historic first, a crypto market structure bill advanced beyond a Senate committee as the Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act passed on a 12-11 party-line vote, establishing CFTC regulatory authority over digital commodities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines on January 29 to advance its version of a cryptocurrency market structure bill, marking the first time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act advanced on a 12-11 vote with all Republicans voting &quot;yes&quot; and all Democrats voting &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislation would establish a clear legal definition of digital commodities and create a spot market digital commodity intermediary regulatory regime with the CFTC. It would also create consumer protections, including conflict of interest safeguards and customer disclosure requirements. The proposed bill grants regulatory authority to both the CFTC and the SEC and clarifies the jurisdictional scope between the two agencies—the CFTC would be granted explicit authority over spot market digital asset commodities, while the SEC would maintain authority over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract.</p>
<p>The crypto industry now has two permanent, crypto-friendly chairmen at the SEC and CFTC, with no Democratic pushback. Paul Atkins leads the SEC, while Trump nominee Mike Selig won confirmation late last month and was sworn in as CFTC chairman on December 22. The Senate Banking Committee would also need to approve its version of a crypto market structure bill before the two measures could combine and advance to the full Senate.</p>
<h3>Geopolitical Tensions and Iran Explosion Rattle Crypto Markets - <em>Feb 1, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A sharp escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, including an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port, triggered a wave of selling across crypto, gold, silver, and U.S. stock futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto markets extended their decline as geopolitical tensions escalated, with the selloff gathering pace following reports of an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port—a critical shipping hub on the Strait of Hormuz that handles about a fifth of the world&#39;s seaborne oil. Bitcoin fell sharply, sliding below the $80,000 mark to levels last seen in April 2025, while Ethereum hovered near $2,200 as a wave of liquidations hit leveraged positions during low-liquidity weekend trading.</p>
<p>For the first time, the United States has sanctioned crypto exchanges linked to Iran. This decision, announced at the end of January 2026, targets two British platforms accused of facilitating transactions for Iranian entities under embargo—specifically Zedex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd. for their alleged role in financing Iranian entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>Iran&#39;s crypto ecosystem reached over $7.78 billion in 2025, having grown at a notably faster pace compared to the year prior. Iran&#39;s crypto activity shows significant spikes corresponding to major domestic and geopolitical events. During Iran&#39;s recent protests and internet blackout from December 28, 2025 to January 8, 2026, there were substantial increases in both daily dollar amounts transacted and withdrawals from Iranian exchanges to personal Bitcoin wallets—suggesting Iranians are taking possession of Bitcoin at a markedly higher rate as a rational response to the collapse of the Iranian rial.</p>
