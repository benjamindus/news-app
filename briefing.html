<h3>1. UK Blocks US Access to RAF Bases for Potential Iran Strike Over International Law Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has blocked a request from US President Donald Trump to use UK air bases including Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford during any preemptive attack on Iran, citing concerns that such operations would breach international law, as the White House draws up detailed military plans involving long-range bombers and Trump warns the world will find out &quot;over the next 10 days&quot; whether military action or a diplomatic deal emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has blocked a request from US President Donald Trump to allow US forces to use UK air bases during any preemptive attack on Iran, owing to concerns it would be in breach of international law. Both Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean, and RAF Fairford, a base in Gloucestershire, would be important to any American plans to use long-range bombers in a sustained campaign against Iran. Under prevailing legal interpretations, there is no distinction between the state carrying out a strike and a state that supports it if the latter was aware of the circumstances of an unlawful act, and a strike on Iran would likely not align with Britain&#39;s interpretation of international law.</p>
<p>The dispute has created friction between Trump and Starmer, particularly regarding the Diego Garcia lease deal. Trump pulled his support for Starmer&#39;s lease deal after the U.K. refused to allow its bases to be used to strike Iran, reversing course and saying in a Truth Social post that Starmer is &quot;making a big mistake&quot; in agreeing to the lease deal with Mauritius. The denial of base access represents a significant constraint on US military planning, as Diego Garcia&#39;s strategic location in the Indian Ocean makes it an ideal staging point for bomber operations targeting Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities and military infrastructure, while RAF Fairford routinely hosts US B-52 and B-2 bombers during European deployments.</p>
<p>President Trump announced that the US is planning for &quot;weeks of large-scale warfare&quot; against Iran starting Saturday, with officials telling reporters that military preparations are underway. Iran&#39;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted military exercises near the Strait of Hormuz on Monday, February 17, while the United States has positioned multiple carrier strike groups in the region. Norway relocated approximately 60 military personnel from Iraq and other parts of the Middle East on February 20, citing security concerns amid heightened tensions. The escalating crisis comes as US-Iran nuclear talks have shown limited progress, with Trump issuing a 10-day ultimatum for a diplomatic breakthrough before considering military options.</p>

<h3>2. Trump Announces China Visit March 31-April 2 Following Supreme Court Tariff Ruling</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping, the White House announced on February 21, marking Trump&#39;s first visit to China since 2017 and coming just one day after the Supreme Court struck down key tariffs central to his trade strategy, as the three-day trip at Beijing&#39;s invitation will focus on extending a trade truce reached in October that paused further tariff escalation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to a White House announcement made on February 21. The three-day trip, at Beijing&#39;s invitation, comes more than eight years after Trump&#39;s first visit to China during his initial term as president. The timing is significant as the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key tariffs central to his trade strategy on Friday, February 20, shortly before the White House confirmed the trip. The Beijing talks are expected to focus on extending a trade truce reached in October 2025 that paused further tariff escalation between the world&#39;s two largest economies.</p>
<p>Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have respectively described &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;good communication&quot; between the two countries in recent months, suggesting that diplomatic channels remain open despite persistent tensions over trade, technology, Taiwan, and regional security issues. The visit represents Trump&#39;s most significant engagement with China since returning to office, and comes as both countries navigate complex economic relationships including Chinese purchases of US agricultural products, technology restrictions, and competing visions for Indo-Pacific security architecture. The scheduled visit follows several high-level exchanges between US and Chinese officials throughout early 2026, including discussions on nuclear talks, regional stability, and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced he will travel to China next week to discuss cooperation, stating that U.S. tariff policy is not Europe&#39;s approach — a signal that European powers are pursuing independent engagement with Beijing even as Washington maintains a more confrontational posture. China&#39;s trade surplus rose 20 percent to $1.2 trillion in 2025 as industrial overcapacity drove exports, creating tensions with trading partners who argue that Chinese manufacturing subsidies distort global markets. Trump&#39;s visit will test whether the two sides can establish a more stable framework for managing economic competition, or whether fundamental disagreements over trade practices, human rights, and Taiwan will continue to drive bilateral tensions throughout 2026.</p>

<h3>3. Iran Demands Evidence After Trump and UN Experts Highlight January Protest Killings</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Iranian government blamed &quot;terrorists&quot; for the killings of thousands during nationwide protests last month, demanding evidence after US President Trump and UN human rights experts raised concerns, as Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the government released a list of 3,117 people described as &quot;victims of recent terrorist operation&quot; including about 200 security personnel, while international observers document systematic violence against demonstrators across multiple Iranian cities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Iranian government has blamed &quot;terrorists&quot; for the killings of thousands during nationwide protests in January 2026, after US President Trump and UN human rights experts raised concerns about the regime&#39;s violent crackdown on dissent. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the government released a list of 3,117 people described as &quot;victims of recent terrorist operation,&quot; including about 200 security personnel, in an apparent attempt to deflect responsibility for the death toll and frame the protests as a security crisis rather than popular uprising. The Iranian narrative contrasts sharply with accounts from international human rights organizations, which have documented systematic use of live ammunition against peaceful protesters, mass arrests, and enforced disappearances.</p>
<p>UN human rights experts and international observers have compiled evidence showing that Iranian security forces used lethal force against demonstrators during the January protests, which erupted across multiple cities in response to economic hardship, political repression, and anger over the regime&#39;s handling of various domestic and foreign policy issues. Video footage and witness testimony document security forces firing directly into crowds, beating protesters, and conducting nighttime raids on residential areas to arrest suspected organizers. The scale of the violence represents one of the most severe crackdowns on dissent in Iran since the 2019 protests, which killed an estimated 1,500 people according to Reuters reporting at the time.</p>
<p>President Trump has made Iran&#39;s human rights record a focal point of his administration&#39;s Middle East policy, using the January killings to justify his hardline stance and build international pressure on Tehran. The Trump administration has called for independent investigations into the protest deaths and threatened additional sanctions targeting Iranian officials responsible for human rights abuses. Iran&#39;s insistence that &quot;terrorists&quot; were responsible for the violence and its demand for evidence from accusers represents a standard regime tactic of deflecting blame and avoiding accountability for state-sanctioned repression, while the release of a list including security personnel deaths appears designed to bolster the narrative that Iran faced a coordinated insurgency rather than popular protests.</p>

<h3>4. UN Report Finds &quot;Hallmarks of Genocide&quot; in Sudan&#39;s El Fasher as RSF Kills 6,000</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rapid Support Forces carried out ethnically targeted killings, widespread sexual violence and enforced disappearances during their late-October takeover of El Fasher in Sudan&#39;s Darfur region, with a UN fact-finding mission stating the evidence shows &quot;hallmarks of genocide&quot; against the Zaghawa and Fur communities as at least 6,000 people were killed between October 25-27, 2025, prompting US Treasury sanctions on three RSF commanders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out ethnically targeted killings, widespread sexual violence and enforced disappearances during their late-October takeover of El Fasher in Sudan&#39;s Darfur region — acts that a UN fact-finding mission said show &quot;hallmarks of genocide&quot; against the Zaghawa and Fur communities. The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan said the evidence establishes that at least three underlying acts of genocide were committed: killing members of a protected ethnic group; causing serious bodily and mental harm; and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group&#39;s physical destruction in whole or in part.</p>
<p>The findings focus on events in and around El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, during the RSF takeover in late October 2025, after what the mission described as an 18-month siege that progressively cut off civilians from food, water, medical supplies and humanitarian assistance. The report said the siege &quot;systematically weakened the targeted population through starvation, deprivation, trauma and confinement,&quot; leaving many unable to flee when the assault came. More than 6,000 people were killed between October 25 and October 27 in the city, according to reports, with thousands of persons, particularly the Zaghawa, killed, raped or disappeared during three days of absolute horror.</p>
<p>After publication of the report, the United States Department of the Treasury announced it was imposing sanctions on three RSF commanders, accusing the group of perpetrating &quot;a horrific campaign of ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence&quot; during the siege and capture of el-Fasher. Among those targeted with sanctions were an RSF brigadier general who filmed himself killing unarmed civilians as well as a major general and RSF field commander. In the absence of effective prevention and accountability, the Fact-Finding Mission considers that the risk of further genocidal acts remains serious and ongoing, as Sudan&#39;s brutal civil war continues to create Africa&#39;s worst humanitarian crisis with millions displaced and famine conditions spreading across multiple regions.</p>

<p>At least 50 people were killed and several women and children were abducted after gunmen attacked the village of Tungan Dutse in Nigeria&#39;s Zamfara state, with the assault starting late Thursday night and continuing into Friday morning as armed men arrived on motorcycles and began setting fire to buildings and abducting residents, while Amnesty International reports at least 323 people have been killed in different attacks across six northern states within the first 20 days of February.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least 50 people were killed and several women and children were abducted after gunmen attacked a village in Nigeria&#39;s Zamfara state on February 20-21. The attack started late on Thursday night and continued into Friday morning in Tungan Dutse village in the Bukkuyum area of Zamfara when armed men arrived on motorcycles and began setting fire to buildings and abducting residents. The attackers raided the village from around 5 p.m. on Thursday until about 3:30 a.m. on Friday, burning down buildings and shooting residents who tried to flee, according to local officials and witnesses.</p>
<p>A lawmaker representing Bukkuyum South stated that the gunmen had been &quot;moving from one village to another … leaving at least 50 people dead.&quot; Residents said villagers alerted security forces after spotting more than 150 motorcycles carrying armed men a day earlier, but no action was taken to protect the community. The number of people abducted remained unclear as local officials were still compiling lists of the missing, with particular concern for women and children taken by the attackers. The assault represents the latest in a wave of violence across northern Nigeria, where armed bandit groups have terrorized rural communities for years, kidnapping for ransom, stealing livestock, and attacking villages with impunity.</p>
<p>Amnesty International reported that at least 323 people have been killed in different attacks on rural communities across six northern states within the first 20 days of February 2026, with the killings recorded in Benue, Katsina, Kwara, Kebbi, Niger and Zamfara states. The scale of violence underscores the Nigerian government&#39;s failure to provide security for citizens in rural areas, where bandits operate with limited interference from overstretched security forces. The attacks have displaced tens of thousands of people, disrupted agricultural production, and created humanitarian crises in communities lacking access to basic services, while the Nigerian military&#39;s counterinsurgency operations have failed to eliminate the armed groups or prevent mass casualty attacks on civilian populations.</p>

<h3>6. EU Convenes Emergency Meeting Over Hungary-Slovakia-Ukraine Druzhba Pipeline Dispute</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The European Commission called an extraordinary meeting of its Oil Coordination Group for February 21 to address a growing dispute between Hungary, Slovakia, and Ukraine over the Druzhba oil pipeline, after Budapest and Bratislava halted diesel supplies to Ukraine following a Russian attack that knocked the pipeline out of service, with Hungary blocking a €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine until Kyiv restores the transit of Russian oil to Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The European Commission has called an extraordinary meeting of its Oil Coordination Group to address a growing dispute between Hungary, Slovakia, and Ukraine over the Druzhba oil pipeline. The emergency meeting taking place on Wednesday, February 21, includes participation from Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, as the Commission seeks to mediate a crisis that threatens both energy security and EU-Ukraine relations. Hungary and Slovakia halted diesel supplies to Ukraine after a Russian attack on the pipeline in Ukrainian territory knocked it out of service, with Budapest and Bratislava — who both rely heavily on Russian crude oil transported through the pipeline — accusing Kyiv of deliberately delaying repairs for political reasons.</p>
<p>The disruption began in late January 2026, with the Druzhba pipeline damaged since late January, preventing Russian oil from flowing to Hungary and Slovakia. The pipeline carries Russian crude oil to refineries in central Europe, and its disruption has forced Hungary and Slovakia to seek alternative supplies at higher costs, creating economic pressure on governments already struggling with energy affordability. In January 2026, the European Union adopted legislation requiring all member states to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027, and Hungary and Slovakia have both filed legal challenges against the law, arguing that their geographic position and refinery configurations make them dependent on Russian crude for the near term.</p>
<p>Hungary has stated that it is blocking a €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine until Kyiv restores the transit of Russian oil to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline, creating a direct linkage between the energy dispute and broader EU financial support for Ukraine&#39;s war effort and reconstruction. Ukrainian officials have countered that repairs are proceeding as quickly as possible given the scale of damage from Russian strikes, and have offered the Odesa-Brody pipeline as an alternative route for oil supplies to central Europe. The dispute highlights tensions within the EU over energy policy, with some member states prioritizing rapid decoupling from Russian energy while others argue for pragmatic transitions that account for infrastructure realities and economic constraints.</p>

<h3>7. Israeli Settlers Kill 19-Year-Old Palestinian American in West Bank Village Attack</h3>

<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a 19-year-old Palestinian American man named Nasrallah Abu Siyam during an attack on the village of Mukhmas on February 19, with witnesses stating Abu Siyam was trying to stop settlers from attacking a farmer when he was fatally shot, as the Palestinian Authority&#39;s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026 following 240 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and settlers in 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a 19-year-old Palestinian American man named Nasrallah Abu Siyam during an attack on the village of Mukhmas on Wednesday, February 19. The incident occurred when a group of settlers came to the village and attacked a farmer, prompting clashes after residents intervened to protect the farmer from assault. Witnesses said Abu Siyam had been trying to stop settlers from attacking the farmer when he was fatally shot. Abu Siyam was an American citizen visiting his village when settlers arrived and attempted to steal sheep from a local farmer, triggering the confrontation that ended in his death.</p>
<p>Israeli forces later arrived at the scene, and during the violence armed settlers killed Abu Siyam and injured several others. The Palestinian Authority&#39;s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Israeli forces and settlers killed 240 Palestinians last year, while Palestinians killed 17 Israelis over the same period, six of whom were soldiers. The Israeli military said late Wednesday that unnamed suspects shot at Palestinians, who were later evacuated for medical treatment, but did not say whether any were arrested — a statement that notably fails to identify the shooters or describe any law enforcement response.</p>
<p>The killing highlights escalating violence in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli settlement expansion and settler attacks on Palestinian communities have intensified since the Gaza war began in October 2023. Human rights organizations have documented a pattern of settler violence occurring with impunity, often with Israeli military forces present but failing to intervene or arrest perpetrators. The US State Department confirmed Abu Siyam&#39;s American citizenship and stated it was &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; by his killing, calling for a thorough investigation — though past statements of concern have rarely led to accountability for settler violence against Palestinians, including Palestinian Americans.</p>

<p>President Trump held the inaugural Board of Peace summit on February 20, where members committed at least $7 billion for Gaza reconstruction with funding pledged by Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait, as Trump announced the U.S. would contribute $10 billion though the combined total represents only a small fraction of the roughly $70 billion the UN, EU and World Bank estimate is required to rebuild Gaza.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump held the inaugural Board of Peace summit on Thursday, February 20, where members committed at least $7 billion for Gaza reconstruction, with funding pledged by Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait. Trump also announced that the U.S. would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace initiative, though it was unclear where that funding would be specifically allocated or whether it represents new appropriations or repackaged existing aid commitments. The meeting, attended by representatives of more than 40 countries including several heads of state, marked Trump&#39;s effort to establish an alternative international framework for Gaza governance and reconstruction outside traditional UN structures.</p>
<p>Trump stated at the meeting &quot;We will help Gaza,&quot; and promised to &quot;straighten it out&quot; and &quot;make it successful&quot; and &quot;peaceful,&quot; though he provided no timeline for reconstruction or detailed plans for governance. The $7 billion pledged represents only a small fraction of the roughly $70 billion that the U.N., European Union and World Bank estimated would be required to rebuild Gaza&#39;s destroyed infrastructure, housing, hospitals, schools, and economic base. Israel says Gaza will not be rebuilt until Hamas has laid down its weapons and released all hostages, which has emerged as a major sticking point preventing reconstruction from beginning despite the ceasefire that has been in effect since January.</p>
<p>Notable absences from the Board of Peace included several U.S. allies including France and Canada, who opted not to join the organization, saying they fear it seeks to supplant the United Nations as the primary international body responsible for Gaza reconstruction and governance. Critics argue that the Board of Peace represents an attempt to bypass international humanitarian law and existing multilateral mechanisms, while supporters contend that the UN&#39;s ineffectiveness in Gaza justifies a new approach. No reconstruction has yet begun on the ground in Gaza, where 2.3 million people face dire humanitarian conditions with limited access to clean water, electricity, medical care, and shelter following 16 months of devastating warfare.</p>

<h3>9. Norway Withdraws Military Personnel from Iraq Amid US-Iran Tensions</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Norway has partially withdrawn its troops from Iraq amid escalating security tensions in the Middle East, relocating approximately 60 military personnel stationed in Iraq and Jordan as tensions between the United States and Iran reach critical levels, while the United States is withdrawing F-35 fighter jets from the NATO exercise Cold Response in northern Norway to redeploy air power to the Middle East.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norway has partially withdrawn its troops from Iraq amid escalating security tensions in the Middle East, according to an announcement made on February 20. The Norwegian contingent numbers about 60 military personnel in Iraq and Jordan, and the decision to relocate them reflects growing concern about the security environment as tensions between the United States and Iran reach critical levels. The withdrawal comes as part of broader developments related to US-Iran tensions, with multiple countries reassessing their military presence in the region to avoid being caught in potential crossfire.</p>
<p>The United States is withdrawing much of its planned air power, including F-35 fighter jets, from the NATO exercise Cold Response in northern Norway due to rising tensions with Iran, redirecting these strategic assets to the Middle East theater. The decision to pull advanced fighters from a major NATO exercise underscores the seriousness with which US military planners view the Iran situation, as the Pentagon prioritizes readiness for potential Middle East operations over training exercises. Iran&#39;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted military exercises near the Strait of Hormuz on Monday, February 17, demonstrating Iran&#39;s capability to disrupt global oil shipments through the strategic waterway that handles roughly 20% of the world&#39;s petroleum traffic.</p>
<p>Starting in late January 2026, the United States increased its military presence across the Middle East as part of rising tensions with Iran, with the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group deploying to the region on January 26. Multiple carrier strike groups are now positioned in the Middle East, representing one of the largest concentrations of US naval power in the region in recent years. In recent days, both the United States and Iran have exchanged harsh statements and demonstrated their military presence in the region, with Trump issuing a 10-day ultimatum for diplomatic progress and Iranian officials warning of severe retaliation if attacked.</p>

<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Kospi index closed 2.31% up at 5,808.53 on Friday, February 20, marking a fresh record high and topping the 5,800-point mark for the first time, as South Korean stocks jumped as high as 5,809.91 during afternoon trading driven by a rally in chip and defense stocks including SK Hynix rising 6.15% and Hanwha Aerospace jumping 8.09%, while institutions led the rise with net purchases of 1.61 trillion won.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kospi index closed 2.31% up at 5,808.53 on Friday, February 20, 2026, marking a fresh record high and representing the second straight day of record-breaking performance for South Korean equities. South Korean stocks topped the 5,800-point mark for the first time Friday and jumped as high as 5,809.91 at around 2:37 p.m., as the index surged past key psychological levels on strong investor demand. The index had previously closed at 5,677.25 on Thursday, February 19, after markets reopened following a three-day Lunar New Year holiday, making the Friday rally even more remarkable as momentum continued unabated.</p>
<p>The rally was driven by several factors including a surge in chip and defense stocks, with SK Hynix rising 6.15% and defense giant Hanwha Aerospace jumping 8.09%. Institutions led the rise with net purchases of 1.61 trillion won, demonstrating strong conviction from sophisticated investors about Korean equity valuations and growth prospects. Expectations that upcoming investor-friendly measures will help lift market valuations also supported the rally, as Korean policymakers have signaled intentions to address the &quot;Korea discount&quot; that has historically made Korean stocks trade at lower multiples than regional peers despite strong fundamentals.</p>
<p>The Kospi&#39;s remarkable run has been extraordinary, as the index surpassed the 5,000 mark for the first time on January 27 and the 5,500 level on February 12 — meaning the index has gained roughly 16% in less than a month. The dollar dipped after the Supreme Court ruling against Trump&#39;s tariffs, while South Korea&#39;s Kospi hit a fresh record high for the second straight session, benefiting from both domestic factors and favorable global liquidity conditions. Analysts attribute the rally to multiple factors including strong earnings from semiconductor companies benefiting from AI chip demand, Korea&#39;s improving corporate governance practices, expectations for Bank of Korea monetary policy support, and international investors increasing allocations to Korean equities after years of underweighting the market.</p>

<h3>1. Trump Imposes New 10% Global Tariff After Supreme Court Strikes Down Emergency Levies</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump announced on February 20 he would sign an executive order to enact a 10% global tariff after the Supreme Court struck down his previous tariffs in a 6-3 ruling, with the new levy taking effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on February 24 under Section 122 of trade law which allows tariffs for only 150 days absent Congressional extension, as the Supreme Court ruled Trump had asserted &quot;extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope&quot; that violated federal law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Friday, February 20, 2026, the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump&#39;s far-reaching global tariffs, ruling that they violated federal law. The court, in a 6-3 ruling, struck down the tariffs Trump imposed under an emergency powers law, specifically the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority that Trump had asserted &quot;extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope,&quot; but the court&#39;s majority ruled that IEEPA &quot;does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.&quot;</p>
<p>President Trump announced he would sign an executive order to enact a 10% global tariff after the Supreme Court struck down his previous tariffs. Trump announced on social media Friday night that he had signed the 10% global tariff that he previewed earlier in the day, stating he would enact the tariff under a trade law known as Section 122, though these tariffs can only be in place for 150 days absent an extension from Congress. The new levy will take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on February 24, giving markets and businesses less than four days to prepare for the policy change.</p>
<p>Financial markets reacted positively to the Supreme Court ruling despite Trump&#39;s subsequent announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 advancing 0.69% to close at 6,909.51, the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.9% to settle at 22,886.07, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 230.81 points (0.47%) to end at 49,625.97. The dollar dipped after the Supreme Court ruling against Trump&#39;s tariffs, as traders weighed the implications of constrained executive authority on trade policy. Analysts at Wolfe Research expect &quot;the tariffs will be reconstituted under other authorities,&quot; as Treasury Secretary Scot Bessent has previously said the administration has &quot;lots of other authorities that can be used&quot; to impose trade restrictions, suggesting the tariff battle will continue through 2026.</p>

<h3>2. US GDP Growth Slows to 1.4% in Q4, Core PCE Inflation Jumps to 3% in December</h3>

<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on February 20 that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.4% in Q4 2025, significantly below the 2.5% consensus forecast and down from 4.4% growth in Q3, with the government shutdown subtracting 1.0 percentage point from GDP, while Core PCE inflation jumped 0.4% month-over-month in December marking the highest monthly increase since February 2025 and complicating the Federal Reserve&#39;s rate cut timeline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on February 20 that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 according to the advance estimate, representing a significant slowdown from the third quarter when real GDP increased 4.4 percent. The 1.4% growth rate came in well below the Dow Jones economists&#39; expectations of 2.5% gain for the period, with the government shutdown being cited as a major factor in the disappointing result. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the reduction in services provided by the federal government subtracted about 1.0 percentage point from real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation report released simultaneously showed inflation figures for December 2025 that came in hotter than expected. The PCE index rose 0.4% in December on a monthly basis and is up 2.9% from a year ago — figures that were both slightly above the estimate of LSEG economists, who predicted 0.3% and 2.8%, respectively. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, which excludes food and energy and represents the Federal Reserve&#39;s preferred inflation metric, was up 0.4% on a monthly basis and rose 3.0% year over year, with the monthly increase representing the highest level since last February.</p>
<p>The combination of weak GDP and sticky inflation creates a stagflation-lite scenario that keeps the Fed pinned at 3.50-3.75% with no cuts expected before June at the earliest. Federal Reserve officials had signaled at their January meeting that further rate cuts should be paused, with some officials even entertaining the notion that rate hikes could be on the table if inflation remains elevated. The December PCE data provides ammunition to those FOMC members who argued for a more restrictive policy stance and suggests that the timeline for the next rate cut may be pushed further into 2026, with most major financial institutions having already moved their expectations for the next rate cut to June 2026 or later.</p>

<p>Nvidia reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on February 25 after market close, with Wall Street expecting roughly $65.7 billion in revenue (up 67% year over year) and earnings of $1.52 per share, though some analysts predict the company could hit $67-76 billion as CEO Jensen Huang described demand for the B200 and GB200 chips as &quot;off the charts&quot; and &quot;insane,&quot; with Polymarket traders pricing in 94.5% probability Nvidia beats the EPS consensus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nvidia reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on February 25, 2026 after market close, in what may be the most scrutinized earnings report of the quarter given the company&#39;s central role in the AI infrastructure buildout. Wall Street expects roughly $65.7 billion in revenue, up 67% year over year, though some analysts are more bullish. Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider predicts $67.3 billion in quarterly revenue — roughly $2 billion higher than the broader market consensus. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik expects Nvidia to potentially hit $67 billion, while UBS analyst Arcuri expects $76 billion in revenue, reflecting the wide range of estimates for a company whose business is growing at unprecedented rates.</p>
<p>Wall Street expects earnings of $1.52 per share, and Polymarket traders are pricing in 94.5% probability Nvidia beats the $1.52 EPS consensus, reflecting the company&#39;s strong track record of exceeding expectations. The artificial intelligence tech leader has beaten the analyst consensus earnings estimate in 20 of the past 22 quarters, establishing a pattern of outperformance that has made Nvidia one of the most reliable earnings beats in the technology sector. CEO Jensen Huang described demand for the B200 and GB200 chips as &quot;off the charts&quot; and &quot;insane,&quot; confirming the company is effectively sold out through the middle of 2026.</p>
<p>Multiple price target increases have been issued ahead of the earnings report, with UBS raising NVDA stock&#39;s price target from $235 to $245 and Bank of America maintaining a &quot;Buy&quot; rating with a price target of $275. Nvidia&#39;s guidance assumed no data center AI chip sales to China, which could provide upside if resumed as geopolitical tensions ease or export restrictions are modified. The earnings report comes at a critical moment for AI infrastructure spending, as investors question whether the current pace of capital expenditure by hyperscale cloud providers is sustainable or whether a pause in AI buildout could emerge in 2026-2027, making Nvidia&#39;s commentary on customer demand and forward guidance particularly important for the entire technology sector.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Home Depot will hold its Fourth Quarter &amp; Fiscal Year Earnings Conference Call on Tuesday, February 24, at 9 a.m. ET, with results released before the market opens. The home improvement retailer&#39;s earnings will provide a critical read on US consumer spending and housing market trends, as Home Depot&#39;s sales reflect both do-it-yourself consumer activity and professional contractor demand linked to new home construction and renovation projects. Investors will focus on comparable store sales growth, average ticket size, and transaction counts to assess whether consumers are pulling back on discretionary home improvement spending amid elevated mortgage rates and economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Alibaba is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on February 24 for the period ending December 31, 2025. The Chinese e-commerce and cloud computing giant&#39;s results will be closely watched for signs of recovery in Chinese consumer spending and the success of the company&#39;s cloud and international expansion strategies. Analysts expect continued strong growth in Alibaba&#39;s cloud division, which has posted double-digit percentage gains as AI-related product revenue has achieved triple-digit growth for six consecutive quarters. However, questions remain about the core e-commerce business as Chinese consumers face economic headwinds including the ongoing property sector downturn and weak consumer confidence.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of Home Depot and Alibaba reporting on the same day provides investors with simultaneous reads on the world&#39;s two largest consumer markets — the United States and China — at a time when both economies face distinct challenges. Home Depot&#39;s results will test the resilience of American consumers who have faced elevated interest rates, inflation, and economic uncertainty, while Alibaba&#39;s numbers will reveal whether Chinese stimulus measures and policy support are translating into improved consumer spending. Both companies have experienced stock volatility in 2026, with investors uncertain about the outlook for consumer discretionary spending amid persistent macroeconomic crosscurrents.</p>

<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bank of England&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 5-4 to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% at its meeting ending February 4, with four members voting to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.5%, as CPI inflation ticked up to 3.4% in December 2025 remaining above the Bank&#39;s 2% target though inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April owing to developments in energy prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bank of England&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 5-4 to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% at its meeting ending on February 4, 2026, in one of the closest votes in recent years. Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%, reflecting significant division within the committee about the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The narrow vote underscores uncertainty about the UK economic outlook, with some MPC members concerned that restrictive policy is no longer necessary given moderating inflation pressures, while others worry that premature easing could allow inflation to become entrenched above target.</p>
<p>CPI inflation ticked up to 3.4% in December 2025, which remains above the Bank&#39;s 2% target, though the MPC assessment indicates that inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April owing to developments in energy prices including measures announced in Budget 2025. The uptick in inflation from 2.6% in November to 3.4% in December was driven primarily by energy price base effects and some services inflation persistence, though core goods inflation has continued to moderate. The Bank&#39;s forecast suggests that inflation will return to near the 2% target by mid-2026, though significant uncertainty surrounds this projection given global energy market volatility and domestic wage pressures.</p>
<p>The decision to hold rates at 3.75% comes as the UK economy navigates a delicate balance between supporting growth and ensuring inflation returns sustainably to target. Prime Minister Starmer&#39;s government has made economic growth its top priority, and some officials have privately expressed concern that excessively tight monetary policy could undermine efforts to boost business investment and productivity growth. The Bank of England&#39;s next scheduled rate decision will be announced on March 19, 2026, when the committee will have access to updated inflation data and can assess whether the predicted moderation in price pressures is materializing as forecast.</p>

<h3>6. Active Management Gains Ground as Market Volatility Rewards Tactical Positioning</h3>

<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A noisy, unsettled Wall Street is making active fund managers look smart again after years of underperformance, as a market rattled by tariff whiplash, AI disruption fears, brewing Middle East conflict and stretched valuations has rewarded tactical positioning, with Bloomberg reporting that Wall Street&#39;s &quot;smart money&quot; is gaining ground as passive investing lags in 2026 after dominating for over a decade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A noisy, unsettled Wall Street is doing what years of simply owning the index rarely has: made the smart money look smart again. In a market rattled by tariff whiplash, AI disruption fears, a brewing Middle East conflict and stretched valuations, getting tactical has paid off in ways that a decade of devotion to buy and hold did not. Bloomberg reports that Wall Street&#39;s &quot;smart money&quot; is gaining ground as passive investing lags in 2026, representing a potential inflection point in the multi-decade shift toward index funds and exchange-traded funds that has defined the investment management industry since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Passive large-blend strategies have outperformed active large-blend strategies for eight consecutive years leading up to 2022, and then again in 2023 and 2024, establishing index funds as the default choice for most retail and institutional investors. However, the challenging 2026 market environment characterized by sector rotation, elevated volatility, and dispersed stock returns has created conditions where stock selection and risk management skills can add value. Only 24% of active funds have outperformed a passive alternative over 10 years, and just 29% outperformed over the year through November 2025, yet early 2026 data suggests active managers are having more success navigating the current environment.</p>
<p>Market concentration has been a double-edged sword for active managers, as Nvidia alone accounted for 20% of the rise in the S&amp;P 500 in 2024, and the average S&amp;P 500 index fund had 28% of the portfolio&#39;s market cap invested in the seven largest tech giants, making it particularly difficult for active managers to outperform by underweighting megacap technology stocks. However, in 2026 the narrative has shifted, as concerns about AI sustainability and valuation have led to underperformance in the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; stocks that dominated 2023-2025 returns. Active managers who reduced exposure to expensive technology names and increased allocations to financials, energy, and international markets have outperformed, demonstrating that cyclical nature of active versus passive returns over longer periods.</p>

<h3>7. US Dollar Index Falls After Tariff Ruling Despite Firm Economic Data, Down 8% Over 12 Months</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DXY exchange rate rose to 97.87 on February 19 as firm US industrial production and core capital goods orders data reduced expectations for multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026, yet over the past 12 months the United States Dollar has weakened 8.00% reflecting the dollar&#39;s worst annual performance since 2017, while the EUR/USD trades at 1.19 and GBP/USD around 1.34-1.35 as markets process divergent economic data and geopolitical developments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The DXY exchange rate rose to 97.87 on February 19, 2026, up 0.17% from the previous session, as the US Dollar Index (DXY) climbed toward 98 near a four-week high amid firm US economic data and a more hawkish Federal Reserve tone that reduced expectations for multiple rate cuts this year. The greenback was supported by data showing US industrial production rose at its fastest pace in nearly a year, core capital goods orders exceeded forecasts, and housing starts reached a five-month high — a constellation of indicators suggesting the US economy retains more momentum than many analysts had anticipated. However, the dollar dipped after the Supreme Court ruling against Trump&#39;s tariffs on February 20, as traders weighed the implications of constrained executive authority on trade policy.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, the United States Dollar has weakened 8.00%, representing the dollar&#39;s worst annual performance since 2017 and reflecting a combination of factors including narrowing interest rate differentials as other central banks maintain restrictive policy, concerns about US fiscal sustainability as the federal debt tops $38 trillion, and geopolitical developments that have reduced the dollar&#39;s safe-haven premium. As of mid-February 2026, the US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading in the high-90s, close to recent multi-month lows, having fallen from levels above 106 that prevailed in late 2025.</p>
<p>The EUR/USD is trading at critical resistance level in the 1.19 area, having strengthened significantly from levels below 1.05 that prevailed during the peak of the European energy crisis in 2025, while GBP/USD is trading around 1.34-1.35, well above the 2025 lows near 1.20 and reflecting improved sentiment about the UK economy under Prime Minister Starmer&#39;s government. Major currency pairs are experiencing elevated volatility as markets process divergent economic data, central bank policy signals, and geopolitical developments including US-Iran tensions, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and trade policy uncertainty. Forex strategists note that dollar weakness may overwhelm seasonal tendencies that typically support the greenback in February, with the combination of disappointing Q4 GDP data (1.4% vs 2.5% expected) and hot PCE inflation (0.4% monthly core) creating a challenging policy environment for the Federal Reserve.</p>

<h3>8. Semiconductor Stocks Split as Applied Materials and TSMC Rally While Intel Guides Below Expectations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applied Materials surged after reporting Q1 revenue of $7.01 billion and CEO Gary Dickerson stating the company expects to grow its semiconductor equipment business over 20% in calendar year 2026 fueled by AI computing investments, while Taiwan Semiconductor posted 37% monthly revenue growth outpacing its 30% full-year target, as Intel dropped sharply after guiding Q1 revenue to $11.7-12.7 billion citing memory supply constraints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Applied Materials surged after reporting Q1 fiscal 2026 revenue of $7.01 billion and beating earnings estimates, with CEO Gary Dickerson stating the company expects to grow its semiconductor equipment business over 20% in calendar year 2026, fueled by acceleration of industry investments in AI computing infrastructure. The strong guidance reflects Applied Materials&#39; position as a critical supplier of deposition, etching, and inspection equipment used in advanced chip manufacturing, and indicates that semiconductor foundries and memory manufacturers are maintaining aggressive capital expenditure programs despite macroeconomic uncertainty. The company benefits from multiple growth drivers including the transition to Gate-All-Around transistor architectures, high-bandwidth memory production expansion, and advanced packaging technologies required for AI accelerators.</p>
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) posted monthly revenue growth of 37% in its latest report, significantly outpacing the 30% full-year growth rate target the company set for 2026, as demand continues accelerating for leading-edge chip production capacity. Shares of Taiwan Semi are already up more than 20% year-to-date as TSMC captures the majority of production for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other designers of advanced AI and computing chips that require the most sophisticated manufacturing processes. Micron Technology extended its rally after the company projected record Q2 revenue of $18.70 billion with 68% gross margins, reflecting the extraordinary profitability of memory chips amid supply constraints and surging AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory used in GPU clusters.</p>
<p>Intel dropped sharply after guiding Q1 2026 revenue to $11.7-12.7 billion, citing memory supply constraints affecting handset demand and continued weakness in the PC market, while Nvidia shares fell on February 20 following commentary from Arista Networks&#39; CEO that pointed to the GPU giant losing market share in certain AI networking segments to competitors including Broadcom and custom solutions from hyperscale cloud providers. The divergence in semiconductor stock performance reflects investor discrimination between companies positioned at the core of AI infrastructure buildout (Applied Materials, TSMC, Micron) and those facing competitive or cyclical headwinds (Intel). Analysts note that while the semiconductor sector is expected to surpass $1 trillion in annual sales for the first time in 2026, growth will be concentrated in AI-related segments while traditional computing and consumer electronics markets remain weak.</p>

<h3>9. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.01%, Lowest Level Since September 2022, as Spring Buying Season Approaches</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freddie Mac&#39;s 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, down from 6.09% the prior week and representing the lowest level since September 2022, as the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35% down from 5.44%, with borrowers taking out a $450,000 loan at today&#39;s lower rates able to shave more than $200 off their monthly mortgage payment compared to a year ago when rates averaged 6.85%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freddie Mac&#39;s 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, 2026, down from 6.09% last week and representing the lowest level since September 2022, providing homebuyers with improved affordability as the spring buying season approaches. The current average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 6.24% as of Friday, February 20, 2026, according to Bankrate&#39;s national survey, with the 30-year fixed mortgage APR averaging 6.30% — figures that reflect modest variation across lenders but confirm the downward trend in borrowing costs. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35%, down from 5.44% the prior week according to Freddie Mac, offering a more attractive option for borrowers able to handle higher monthly payments in exchange for lower total interest costs.</p>
<p>Borrowers taking out a $450,000 loan at today&#39;s lower rates could shave more than $200 off their mortgage payment compared to a year ago, when 30-year fixed rates averaged 6.85%, translating to approximately $2,400 in annual savings and meaningfully improving housing affordability for potential buyers who have been sidelined by elevated borrowing costs. Mortgage rates are moving lower as financial markets price in potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2026, despite the hot PCE inflation data released February 20 that complicates the Fed&#39;s monetary policy calculus. The decline in mortgage rates from the 7%+ levels that prevailed through much of 2025 has begun to unlock some housing market activity, with pending home sales data showing modest improvement in recent weeks.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Global Research sees U.S. house prices stalling at 0% growth in 2026, with a slight improvement in demand likely offsetting any increased supply as builders continue delivering units started in prior years. While fixed-rate mortgage rates are projected to stay elevated at 6%+ through most of 2026, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates could tick downward if the Fed decides to ease monetary policy in the second half of the year — a scenario that would provide additional support for housing market activity. The 2026 real estate outlook compiled by the National Association of Realtors suggests that while elevated mortgage rates remain a headwind, the spring buying season could see improved transaction volumes as potential buyers adjust expectations to the &quot;new normal&quot; of 6% rates rather than waiting for a return to the sub-4% rates that prevailed during the pandemic era.</p>

<h3>10. Warner Bros. Discovery Faces February 23 Deadline as Paramount Window Closes</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced on February 17 it is reopening deal discussions with Paramount Skydance after Netflix granted a limited waiver permitting WBD to engage with Paramount for a seven-day window ending February 23, as Paramount CEO David Ellison sweetened his offer to $31 per share with a commitment to cover the $2.8 billion Netflix breakup fee and a &quot;ticking fee&quot; of $650 million per quarter if the deal is not completed by end of 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced on February 17 that it is reopening deal discussions with Paramount Skydance after Netflix granted a limited waiver under the terms of WBD&#39;s existing merger agreement with the streaming giant, permitting WBD to engage with Paramount Skydance for a seven-day window ending February 23, 2026. The development sets up a dramatic climax to one of the most complex media consolidation sagas in decades, as WBD faces a critical decision point on whether to proceed with its December 2025 agreement to sell most of itself to Netflix for $72 billion in equity at $27.72 per share (excluding cable channels including CNN), or to accept Paramount CEO David Ellison&#39;s competing all-cash offer that has been sweetened to $31 per share for the entire company including the cable assets.</p>
<p>Paramount&#39;s sweetened February offer added significant inducements designed to make the deal economically compelling for WBD shareholders: a promise to cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee WBD would owe Netflix if it abandoned the streaming deal, a commitment to backstop a refinancing that would cut WBD&#39;s debt costs by $1.5 billion annually, and a &quot;ticking fee&quot; of $650 million per quarter in cash if the Paramount-WBD deal is not completed by end of 2026 — effectively compensating shareholders for any delay in deal closure. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos responded with characteristic confidence, telling media &quot;let them make a move,&quot; while confirming Netflix&#39;s merger agreement with WBD remains the company&#39;s preferred outcome.</p>
<p>WBD announced it will hold a special shareholder meeting on March 20 at which it will recommend voting to approve the Netflix deal, meaning the one-week Paramount window running through February 23 is a genuine opportunity for Paramount to make a case to the WBD board that its offer materially exceeds the Netflix deal&#39;s value to shareholders. The outcome will help determine whether Hollywood&#39;s most coveted content library — including Warner Bros.&#39; DC Comics franchise, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and HBO&#39;s prestige television catalog — combines with Netflix&#39;s distribution platform to create a vertically integrated streaming colossus, or becomes part of a reconstituted old-media giant under Ellison&#39;s Paramount umbrella. The combined WBD-Netflix entity would be valued at approximately $100 billion including debt, while a WBD-Paramount combination would create an $80 billion company with significantly different strategic positioning.</p>

<h3>1. Venezuela Signs Amnesty Law Enabling Release of Hundreds of Political Prisoners</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venezuela&#39;s acting President Delcy Rodríguez signed into law an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds of politicians, activists, lawyers and others detained since 1999, though the requirement for judicial approval of each case and exclusions for certain crimes have fueled skepticism among opposition groups and prisoners&#39; rights organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Venezuela&#39;s acting President Delcy Rodríguez signed into law on Thursday an amnesty bill that grants general amnesty to political prisoners processed or convicted since 1999 through the present day. The law represents a significant shift in Venezuela&#39;s approach to political detention, potentially affecting hundreds of opposition figures, activists, journalists, students and others detained during protests in 2014, 2017, 2019 and beyond. According to Foro Penal, 448 prisoners have been released since January 8, but over 600 people remain detained on political grounds.</p>
<p>Under the new law, trial courts must approve each amnesty request within 15 days, with lawmakers allowing those abroad to have a lawyer seek amnesty on their behalf rather than forcing them to return to Venezuela. However, people convicted of human rights violations, war crimes, murder, drug trafficking and corruption do not qualify for amnesty. The requirement for judicial oversight has created significant concerns given Venezuela&#39;s historically politicized court system.</p>
<p>Members of Venezuela&#39;s opposition, prisoners&#39; rights groups and relatives of long-detained individuals gave a lukewarm reception to the measure. Critics point out that the amnesty&#39;s effectiveness depends entirely on how trial courts—which have historically acted as instruments of government policy—handle applications. The law comes as Venezuela seeks to normalize relations with the international community following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro and the installation of a transitional government backed by the United States.</p>

<h3>2. Poland Exits Landmine Ban Treaty, Plans Rapid Deployment System Along Eastern Border</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poland officially withdrew from the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines on Friday, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk announcing the country will &quot;soon&quot; have capability to mine its eastern borders within 48 hours in case of threat from Russia or Belarus, marking Poland as the latest NATO member to abandon the 1997 treaty amid heightened security concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poland officially exited the Ottawa Convention banning the use of land mines on Friday, February 20, 2026, according to Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Poland had ratified the treaty in 2012 and completed destruction of its domestic anti-personnel mine stockpile in 2016, but security assessments following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine prompted a fundamental reassessment of defensive requirements. Deputy Defense Minister Paweł Zalewski stated that land mines would form a central component of a layered defensive system along the country&#39;s borders with Russia&#39;s Kaliningrad exclave to the north and Belarus to the east.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Tusk presented the Bluszcz or &quot;Ivy,&quot; a hybrid mine layer designed for stealth and autonomy, which Poland plans to deploy for rapid mine deployment. The system represents cutting-edge military technology enabling Poland to establish defensive minefields far more rapidly than traditional methods. Strips of land mines might be included between other defensive physical elements making up the so-called Eastern Shield, a system of enhanced fortifications Poland has been building on its borders with Belarus and Russia since 2024.</p>
<p>Poland emphasized that it would only deploy mines along its borders &quot;when there is a realistic threat of Russian aggression&quot; and plans to domestically manufacture both anti-personnel and anti-tank mines. Last year, Warsaw joined Finland and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in announcing departure from the treaty, as countries near Russia reassess their security posture. The National Rally in France condemned the moves as &quot;anti-democratic,&quot; though Poland maintains the decision reflects legitimate sovereign defense requirements in an increasingly dangerous security environment.</p>

<h3>3. Cambodia Accuses Thailand of Ongoing Border Violations Despite Ceasefire Agreement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cambodia&#39;s Prime Minister Hun Manet accused Thai forces of continuing acts of aggression along the disputed border despite a December 2025 ceasefire, with nearly 98,000 people remaining displaced across the region as the Cambodia-Thailand border dispute remains under international scrutiny following conflict that damaged the Preah Vihear temple and displaced over 550,000 at its peak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cambodia says Thai troops are continuing what it calls acts of aggression along the disputed border, despite a second ceasefire agreement that took effect on December 27, 2025. AFP, Reuters, and the Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asia reported on the Cambodia-Thailand conflict, including damage to Preah Vihear temple and the deployment of barbed wire and shipping containers by Thai forces in villages in Banteay Meanchey province. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has firmly rejected any attempt to alter the Cambodia-Thailand border or to occupy Cambodian territory in violation of international law.</p>
<p>As of early February 2026, nearly 98,000 people remain displaced across displacement sites and host communities, including over 51,000 women and 31,000 children, though around 85 per cent of displaced people—about 550,000 individuals—have returned to their places of origin following the ceasefire. The displacement crisis has created severe humanitarian challenges, with displaced populations requiring sustained support for food, shelter, medical care and livelihood restoration.</p>
<p>The bilateral mechanisms have gradually resumed their functions, with both sides maintaining regular and direct lines of communication between their Ministers of Defense and Chiefs of Defense Forces. Local residents have been able to gradually resume their normal lives. Hun Manet suggested that the United States-led Board of Peace could help resolve the border dispute. The dispute stems from the colonial-era demarcation of their 800km (500-mile) border, where both sides claim territory and centuries-old temple ruins.</p>

<h3>4. Germany&#39;s Chancellor Merz Questions FCAS Fighter Program, Considers Additional F-35 Purchases</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19–20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested Germany could abandon the €100 billion Future Combat Air System project with France and Spain, stating Germany does not require the same next-generation fighter as nuclear-armed France, while reports indicate Berlin is weighing purchase of 35 additional U.S.-made F-35A fighter jets beyond the 35 aircraft ordered in 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that Germany could abandon the FCAS project altogether, stating that France has &quot;different needs&quot; than Germany and Spain as a nuclear power. Speaking on the podcast Machtwechsel, Merz said Germany does not require the same next-generation fighter as France, which needs an aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons and operating from aircraft carriers. The comments represent the most serious public questioning of FCAS by a senior German official since the program began nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>Germany, France and Spain have been working on the Future Combat Air System to replace the Eurofighter and Rafale jets by 2040. The programme has been stalled due to disagreements between Airbus and Dassault, with the latter claiming it could build the jet on its own if needed and calling for the bulk of the workforce to be based in France. Germany is weighing the purchase of up to 35 additional U.S.-made F-35A fighter jets beyond the 35 aircraft ordered in 2022, as the trinational FCAS program remains stalled. However, a German government spokesperson said on February 19 that there are no plans and no decision regarding additional F-35 acquisitions.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on February 19, 2026, that he and French President Emmanuel Macron had agreed to take a decision on FCAS by the end of 2026. In March 2022, Berlin decided to purchase 35 Lockheed Martin F-35s to replace the Bundeswehr&#39;s ageing Tornado fleet. The FCAS controversy represents a significant challenge to European defense integration at precisely the moment when the continent faces its most serious security threats since the Cold War.</p>

<h3>5. France&#39;s Macron Plans Strategic Appointments to ECB and Bank of France Before 2027 Elections</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19–20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron is planning to appoint loyalists to over 60 ambassadorial posts and positions at the Bank of France and potentially the ECB presidency to ensure policy continuity, with ECB President Christine Lagarde reportedly considering early departure before her October 2027 mandate expires to allow Macron and German Chancellor Merz to oversee appointment of her successor before France&#39;s April 2027 presidential elections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Macron is planning to appoint loyalists to over 60 ambassadorial posts, the head of the national auditor, and positions at the Bank of France and potentially the ECB presidency. The strategy is explicitly to ensure policy continuity regardless of who wins in April 2027, when French presidential elections will take place. Macron is constitutionally barred from running for a third term, and polls currently suggest that the far-right Rassemblement National is in pole position to secure the French presidency.</p>
<p>Bank of France chief François Villeroy de Galhau, who also sits on the ECB&#39;s Governing Council, recently announced his early exit. That leaves the selection of his replacement to France&#39;s Emmanuel Macron, rather than any successor from Marine Le Pen&#39;s National Rally. The most likely successor for Villeroy de Galhau is thought to be Emmanuel Moulin, a confidant of Macron as secretary-general of the Élysée Palace, who was director of the French Treasury in 2020-24.</p>
<p>Christine Lagarde could step down as President of the European Central Bank before her mandate expires in October 2027, reportedly aiming to vacate her Frankfurt seat months before the French presidential elections in April 2027. Stepping aside early would ensure Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz oversee the appointment of Lagarde&#39;s successor. National Rally has condemned the moves as &quot;anti-democratic,&quot; arguing that Macron is attempting to entrench his political allies in positions that should be filled by democratically elected successors.</p>

<h3>6. Major Nor&#39;easter Threatens Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with Potentially Historic Snowfall</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 20–21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer models show significant uncertainty about a potential major snowstorm developing Sunday into Monday, with the GFS model predicting a near-record snowstorm for Washington, DC and the Mid-Atlantic while the Euro model shows a much weaker system—with forecasters warning that a change of just 100-200 miles in the storm&#39;s track could determine whether major cities see a full-fledged nor&#39;easter or just light snow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is significant uncertainty about a potential major snowstorm this weekend, with the GFS model predicting a near-record snowstorm for Washington, DC and the Mid-Atlantic with a bomb cyclone tracking close to the coast, while the Euro model shows a much weaker storm tracking farther offshore with lighter snow. Computer models agree a storm will begin developing off the coast of the mid-Atlantic on Sunday and could strengthen enough to be classified as a bomb cyclone through Monday. However, models diverge on the storm&#39;s exact track Sunday into Monday, which will determine who gets snow.</p>
<p>A change of just 100 or 200 miles could be the difference between big cities in the Northeast seeing a full-fledged nor&#39;easter that packs significant snow and strong winds, or a storm that just brings light snow that maybe slows travel. The most likely scenario involves snow extending as far west as the Interior Northeast and Great Lakes that might slow down travel but should be manageable, with gusty winds and some coastal flooding also possible.</p>
<p>This comes after major cities along the I-95 corridor have already recorded above-average snow for the first time in several years this winter, due mostly to a historic and deadly January storm. The forecast should become clearer in the coming hours as the storm approaches. The potential storm has prompted emergency preparations across the region, with state and local governments pre-positioning equipment and supplies for potential snow removal and emergency response operations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A senior Iranian official publicly acknowledged that security forces executed wounded protesters during the nationwide uprising of January 2026, with witness accounts reporting that security forces &quot;finished off&quot; wounded survivors in hospitals and streets—as UN human rights experts urge Iranian authorities to immediately disclose the fate of detained individuals and halt all executions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A senior Iranian official has publicly acknowledged that security forces executed wounded protesters during the nationwide uprising of January 2026. This shocking admission confirms long-standing accusations by the Iranian Resistance. In Rasht, security forces reportedly surrounded and trapped protesters inside the Rasht Bazaar, set it on fire, and killed people attempting to surrender or escape, while also &quot;finishing off&quot; wounded survivors in the streets and hospitals. Images released from morgues leave little doubt that some wounded citizens were shot in the head while hospitalized and undergoing medical treatment.</p>
<p>Witnesses report the abduction of wounded protesters from hospitals and the execution of injured people who were unable to move. A Karaj taxi driver described security forces loading both dead and wounded protesters into trucks without distinction, stating &quot;Even the wounded were not separated from the dead. They piled everyone together&quot;. Iranian authorities have acknowledged 3,117 deaths and approximately 3,000 arrests, whereas human rights organizations estimate these figures to be in the tens of thousands. Between 30,000 and 36,500 protesters were reportedly killed during January 8-9.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations report a dramatic surge in executions in early February—a spike that comes just weeks after nationwide protests erupted in January. UN human rights experts issued a statement on February 20, 2026, urging Iranian authorities to immediately disclose the fate of detained individuals and halt all executions. Additionally, 113 Nobel Laureates urged global action on Iran, condemning the killings and execution surge in a letter calling for international accountability measures.</p>

<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freeport-McMoRan announced a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government to extend operational rights for its subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041, with FCX agreeing to transfer 12 percent of its stake to government interests at no cost by 2041, reducing its ownership from 48.76 percent to around 37 percent starting in 2042.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freeport-McMoRan announced on Thursday, February 19, 2026, that it had signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the extension of the mining permit at the Grasberg mine, including an agreement to transfer 12 percent of its stake in PT Freeport Indonesia to government interests at no cost. FCX will maintain its current ownership in PTFI at 48.76 percent until 2041 and hold around 37 percent starting in 2042. By 2041, Freeport will transfer a 12% interest in PT Freeport Indonesia to government entities at no cost, contingent on reimbursement for pro-rata costs incurred, based on book value for investments benefiting the post-2041 period.</p>
<p>Freeport-McMoRan reached a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government to extend the operational rights for its subsidiary, PT Freeport Indonesia, in the Grasberg minerals district, with amendments to its special mining business license allowing for a life of resource extension. As part of this agreement, PT Freeport Indonesia plans to enhance community support in Papua with financial backing for a new hospital and two medical educational institutions.</p>
<p>The agreement represents a significant milestone in Indonesia-Freeport relations, securing extended mining rights at one of the world&#39;s largest copper and gold deposits while increasing Indonesian government ownership in the operations. The Grasberg mine in Papua has been a source of both tremendous wealth and ongoing controversy, with environmental concerns, indigenous rights issues, and questions about revenue distribution creating tensions between the company, local communities, and the Indonesian government for decades.</p>

<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 18–19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI will become the first customer of India&#39;s Tata Consultancy Services&#39; data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of AI-ready capacity and plans to scale to 1 gigawatt, as part of the global $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative—while Tata plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to hundreds of thousands of employees in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI has partnered with India&#39;s Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The deal is part of the global AI infrastructure initiative Stargate, which is a $500 billion multi-year initiative to build AI data centres for training and inference, backed by major investors. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally.</p>
<p>Additionally, the conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services, in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. The dual nature of the partnership—with Tata both providing infrastructure for OpenAI and adopting OpenAI&#39;s technology for its own operations—demonstrates the comprehensive strategic alignment between the two organizations.</p>
<p>These announcements were made at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi in mid-February 2026, representing major infrastructure investments by US tech companies in India&#39;s growing AI ecosystem. The partnership comes as India positions itself as a major hub for AI development and deployment, with the government actively encouraging foreign investment in technology infrastructure while simultaneously developing domestic AI capabilities through initiatives like the Digital India program.</p>

<h3>10. Google Announces $15 Billion &quot;America-India Connect&quot; Subsea Cable Initiative</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 18–19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google announced a $15 billion investment over five years to connect India with the United States through new subsea cables as part of &quot;America-India Connect,&quot; establishing a new international gateway in Visakhapatnam and three new subsea paths connecting India to Singapore, South Africa, and Australia—representing the first direct India-US undersea cable link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project, called &quot;America-India Connect,&quot; includes multiple new undersea routes connecting the United States, India and additional Southern Hemisphere markets. In collaboration with local partners, America-India Connect will establish a new international subsea gateway in Visakhapatram (Vizag); three new subsea paths connecting India to Singapore, South Africa, and Australia; and four strategic fiber-optic routes. At present, most global internet traffic flows through undersea cables routed via hubs such as West Asia or Singapore, as there is no direct India-US link.</p>
<p>Google has announced that it will connect India with the US through new subsea cables as part of a 15 billion dollar investment spread over five years. The investment represents one of Google&#39;s largest infrastructure commitments globally and reflects the company&#39;s assessment that India will become a critical hub for AI development, cloud computing, and digital services over the coming decade.</p>
<p>These announcements were made at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi in mid-February 2026, where Google also announced partnerships with Indian research institutions for DeepMind collaboration and commitments to support AI education and training programs across India. The subsea cable investment addresses a critical infrastructure gap that has long limited India&#39;s ability to compete with other major technology hubs in terms of network latency and bandwidth capacity for data-intensive applications.</p>

<h3>1. Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump Tariffs, Markets Rally as $175 Billion in Import Taxes Nullified</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Trump overstepped his authority in ordering tariffs on nearly everything the U.S. imports, striking down more than $175 billion in collected tariffs under the reciprocal tariff program and emergency-powers tariffs addressing fentanyl trafficking—prompting Trump to announce a new 10% &quot;global tariff&quot; within hours of the ruling as stocks rose modestly on the decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority by invoking a federal emergency-powers law to impose his &quot;reciprocal&quot; tariffs across the globe as well as targeted import taxes the administration says address fentanyl trafficking. At stake is more than $175 billion in tariffs that have been collected under this law. The court said Trump exceeded his authority by invoking emergency powers for what the majority characterized as routine trade policy rather than genuine national emergencies.</p>
<p>The market response was relatively muted despite the ruling&#39;s magnitude. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.69% and closed at 6,909.51, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and settled at 22,886.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 230.81 points, or 0.47%, and ended at 49,625.97. Market watchers noted that this ruling, despite its $175 billion size, was so broadly expected by the market that it was already priced in. Treasuries and a Bloomberg gauge of the dollar fell, while stocks rallied, after the court struck down Trump&#39;s sweeping global tariffs.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump denounced Supreme Court justices who ruled against him as a &quot;disgrace&quot; and announced wide-ranging new tariffs hours after the high court struck down most of his existing import taxes. Trump said Friday he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% &quot;global tariff,&quot; hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping &quot;reciprocal&quot; import duties. The rapid response demonstrates that while the Supreme Court may have rejected Trump&#39;s legal authority under emergency powers statutes, the president retains substantial authority to impose tariffs through other mechanisms.</p>

<h3>2. U.S. GDP Growth Slows Sharply to 1.4% in Q4 as Government Shutdown Impacts Economy</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. economy expanded at an annualized 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, far below the 2.5% gain that economists had anticipated and marking a sharp deceleration from Q3&#39;s 4.4% growth rate—with the Commerce Department attributing much of the weakness to the record-breaking government shutdown that disrupted economic activity across multiple sectors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traders received a downbeat view on growth of the U.S. economy, as gross domestic product increased 1.4% for the fourth quarter. That was far below the 2.5% gain that economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. The record-breaking government shutdown is largely to blame, according to the Commerce Department. The sharp slowdown from Q3&#39;s 4.4% growth rate represents one of the most dramatic quarterly decelerations in recent years absent a recession.</p>
<p>The GDP data presents a complex picture for Federal Reserve policymakers who must balance slowing growth against inflation that remains stubbornly above the central bank&#39;s 2% target. The simultaneous release of December PCE inflation data showing core prices rising 0.4% month-over-month—which would push year-over-year core PCE to approximately 3.0%—creates a particularly challenging environment. The combination of weak growth and elevated inflation evokes uncomfortable parallels to the stagflation of the 1970s, though most economists argue current conditions remain far from that historical benchmark.</p>
<p>The weak GDP reading has significant political implications as well. The government shutdown that contributed to the slowdown was driven by the Trump administration&#39;s efforts to implement spending cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency, creating a scenario where fiscal austerity measures intended to improve long-term fiscal sustainability may have contributed to near-term economic weakness. Market analysts expect volatility to persist as investors grapple with conflicting signals about economic momentum, inflation trajectory, and the appropriate path for monetary policy.</p>

<h3>3. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.01%, Lowest Level Since September 2022, as Spring Buying Season Approaches</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, down from 6.09% the previous week and marking the lowest level in more than three years, while the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35%—spurring a jump in weekly purchase applications and refinance activity as homebuyers gain improved affordability heading into the spring sales season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.01% as of February 19, 2026, down from last week when it averaged 6.09%. This represents the lowest level in more than three years. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.35%, down from last week when it averaged 5.44%. A year ago at this time, the 30-year FRM averaged 6.85%, showing rates have declined significantly year-over-year.</p>
<p>Weekly purchase applications and refinance activity have jumped, underscoring the benefits for both buyers and current owners. It appears that housing activity is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season. Borrowers taking out a $450,000 loan at today&#39;s lower rates could shave more than $200 off their mortgage payment compared to a year ago. The improvement in affordability comes at a critical time for the housing market, which has struggled with severely constrained inventory and declining transaction volumes throughout much of 2025.</p>
<p>After several years of tight inventory and competitive bidding, the housing market in 2026 looks more balanced. Inventory is rising in many parts of the country, homes are taking a little longer to sell, and sellers are gradually adjusting pricing expectations. The shift isn&#39;t dramatic, but it&#39;s consistent and it&#39;s creating more negotiating room than buyers have had in recent years. Many forecasts predict mortgage rates will decrease gradually through 2026, though this decline may be slow and short-term rate increases remain possible depending on inflation and Federal Reserve policy decisions.</p>

<h3>4. Warner Bros. Discovery Reopens Paramount Merger Talks After Netflix Grants Limited Waiver</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 17</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery reopened deal talks with Paramount after Netflix granted a limited waiver extending through February 23 for WBD to negotiate with the studio, setting up a climactic week in media consolidation as Paramount has offered to pay $31 per share versus Netflix&#39;s agreed $27.75 per share deal that faces shareholder vote on March 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery reopened talks with Paramount Skydance on February 17, 2026, giving the studio until February 24 to make its &quot;best and final offer&quot;. A senior Paramount representative informed a WBD board member that it would pay $31 per share if deal talks were to reopen. Netflix switched to an all-cash offer valued at $82.7 billion in December 2025, with the deal valuing the studio and streaming assets at $27.75 per share, excluding cable channels like CNN. WBD set a special shareholder meeting on March 20 to vote on the Netflix deal.</p>
<p>Paramount CEO David Ellison responded to Netflix&#39;s bid by going directly to shareholders with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, including CNN. Paramount launched a hostile tender offer for $30 a share in cash for all of WBD. On February 9, 2026, Paramount certified that it has substantially complied with the U.S. Department of Justice&#39;s &quot;second request&quot; for information related to its tender offer to acquire WBD shares. Paramount enhanced its offer by injecting a $0.25-per-share &quot;ticking fee&quot; payable to WBD shareholders for each quarter its transaction has not closed beyond December 31, 2026, equivalent to about $650 million in cash value each quarter.</p>
<p>The bidding war represents one of the highest-stakes media consolidation battles in decades, with implications for the future structure of Hollywood studios, streaming services, and traditional cable television. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos granted the waiver while publicly stating &quot;let them make a move,&quot; suggesting confidence that WBD&#39;s board will ultimately recommend the Netflix deal despite Paramount&#39;s higher nominal price. The outcome will significantly reshape the media landscape and could trigger additional consolidation as companies seek scale to compete in an increasingly challenging streaming environment.</p>

<h3>5. Federal Reserve Minutes Reveal Division on Rate Path, Some Officials Consider Potential Hikes</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 18</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve meeting minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC session revealed deeper divisions among policymakers than previously understood, with some officials advocating for &quot;more two-sided language&quot; on future rate moves and explicitly raising the possibility of rate hikes—not just cuts—if economic conditions warrant, pushing market expectations for first rate cut beyond mid-2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treasury yields rose for a third consecutive session on Thursday, with the 10-year note climbing to 4.087% and the 2-year note reaching 3.47%, as markets digested Federal Reserve meeting minutes from the January 27-28 FOMC session that revealed deeper divisions among policymakers than previously understood. While the decision to hold rates steady at 3.5-3.75% was broadly supported, the minutes showed some officials advocating for &quot;more two-sided language&quot; on future rate moves, explicitly raising the possibility of rate hikes—not just cuts—if economic conditions warrant.</p>
<p>The hawkish tone in the minutes significantly reduced expectations for near-term monetary easing. CME FedWatch probabilities for a March 2026 rate cut fell to below 5%, with the first fully-priced cut now expected no earlier than June 2026, and even that remains conditional on economic data showing meaningful disinflation. Several policymakers emphasized that sticky inflation readings and a still-solid labor market make any near-term cut premature, while others noted that lagged effects of previous tightening and uncertain tariff environment justify keeping cuts on the table.</p>
<p>The meeting was the first for a new voting cast of regional presidents, at least two of whom, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland, have publicly said they think the Fed should be on hold indefinitely, as both see inflation as a continuing threat. With the Fed already split along ideological lines, the fissure could grow deeper if former Governor Kevin Warsh is confirmed as the next central bank chair. The 10-year note finished at 4.08%, the 2-year note ended at 3.48%, and the 30-year note ended at 4.72% on February 20, 2026.</p>

<p>The DXY exchange rate fell to 97.79 on February 20, down 0.14% from the previous session, as the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Trump&#39;s global tariffs—with the dollar down 8.27% over the last 12 months despite staging a ferocious mid-February rebound from a four-year low of 95.5 hit on January 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The DXY exchange rate fell to 97.7908 on February 20, 2026, down 0.14% from the previous session. After plunging to a four-year low of 95.5 on January 30, 2026, the greenback staged a ferocious mid-February rebound, climbing back toward 98.0 in less than three weeks. Over the past month, the United States Dollar has weakened 0.98%, and is down by 8.27% over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The US Dollar Index eased to 97.7 on Friday, retreating from near one-month highs, after the US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump&#39;s global tariffs. US GDP grew at an annualized 1.4% in Q4, below the 3% forecast, highlighting slower momentum amid tariffs and the government shutdown. The dollar&#39;s downside was limited by sticky December core PCE inflation of 3%, reinforcing expectations that the Fed will maintain a restrictive stance.</p>
<p>The dollar index composition includes the Euro (57.6%), Japanese Yen (13.6%), British Pound (11.9%), Canadian Dollar (9.1%), Swedish Krona (4.2%), and Swiss Franc (3.6%). The dollar&#39;s weakness over the past year reflects multiple factors including concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability, reduced confidence in dollar reserve status as central banks diversify holdings, and uncertainty about U.S. trade policy creating hedging demand for alternative currencies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is trading near $67,400 as cryptocurrency markets hold steady following recent volatility, with Bitcoin ETF outflows hitting $6.8 billion and the consensus pointing toward a trading range between $64,000 and $75,000 as the market searches for a definitive bottom—while Ethereum remains range-bound between $1,900 and $2,000 through mid-February.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BTC is trading near $92k in some reports, still consolidating well below key EMAs after a sharp correction, though more recent data indicates Bitcoin falling below the psychological $70,000 mark and even testing levels near $61,000 in early February 2026. More recent data suggests Bitcoin rebounded above $68,000 as ETF outflows hit $6.8 billion and funding flips positive. The RSI near 33 on the daily timeframe signals the token is approaching the oversold threshold, indicating that its recent price losses are significantly outpacing its gains. For a confirmed bullish shift, a break above $72,000 is needed.</p>
<p>The consensus points toward a trading range between $64,000 and $75,000 as the market searches for a definitive bottom. The broader trend remains bearish as Bitcoin trades well below all major EMAs. As of February 2026, the broader crypto market picture remains cautiously constructive. While short-term volatility has increased, the core drivers of the ongoing bull cycle are still in place, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Ethereum price in February 2026 is expected to trade within the $2,000–$2,500 range as the market attempts to stabilize after the recent sharp selloff. More specifically, the Ethereum price prediction remains range-bound between $1,900 and $2,000 through February 20, 2026, unless a decisive breakout occurs. The broader trend remains bearish as ETH trades well below all major EMAs. Entering February 2026, with Ethereum prices remaining weak, Consensus Hong Kong and ETHDenver have become key indicators that may determine whether the ecosystem can recover against headwinds.</p>

<p>Japan&#39;s Nikkei 225 finished at 56,941.97 on February 13 after briefly touching 58,000, consolidating near record highs following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi&#39;s landslide election victory, while Hong Kong&#39;s Hang Seng Index closed at 26,705.94 on February 16—with Japan&#39;s index posting year-to-date gains of 12.0% and Hong Kong gaining 5.5% through early February.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan&#39;s Nikkei 225 lost 1.21% and finished at 56,941.97 on February 13, 2026, after briefly touching 58,000 on Thursday. The index had previously reached record highs, with the Nikkei 225 rising 2.28% to a new closing high of 57,650.54 on February 10, 2026. Stock purchases helped drive the Nikkei average to a record after the Takaichi-led LDP&#39;s win, with market participants viewing the election outcome as providing political stability that could support continued economic reforms and corporate governance improvements.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#39;s Hang Seng Index fell 1.71% in its final hour of trade on February 13. Earlier in February, Hong Kong&#39;s Hang Seng index was up 0.58% and ended at 27,183.15 on February 10. As of February 16, the Hang Seng closed at 26,705.94, up 138.82 (+0.52%). Japan&#39;s Nikkei 225 was in the top spot with a year-to-date gain of 12.0%, while Hong Kong&#39;s Hang Seng was in second with a year-to-date gain of 5.5% through February 9, 2026.</p>
<p>The Japanese market has been riding positive momentum following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi&#39;s landslide victory in the Lower House, while Asian markets overall have been tracking broader global market trends and AI-related sentiment shifts. The divergence in performance between Japanese and Hong Kong markets reflects different economic fundamentals and investor sentiment, with Japan benefiting from corporate reforms and political stability while Hong Kong faces ongoing concerns about China&#39;s economic trajectory and regulatory environment.</p>

<h3>9. Pakistan Delays $250 Million Panda Bond Issuance Again, Now Expected in March</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 11</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pakistan postponed its first-ever Panda bond issuance in China&#39;s domestic capital market for the fourth time due to incomplete preparations by the Ministry of Finance, with the $250 million yuan-denominated green bond now expected in March 2026 after missing the February target—representing Pakistan&#39;s return to global bond markets after repayment stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pakistan was preparing to issue its first-ever Panda bond in China&#39;s domestic capital market, with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb initially targeting completion before Chinese New Year in February 2026, with a debut size equivalent to $250 million in Chinese yuan. However, the bond issuance has been delayed for the fourth time due to incomplete preparations by the Ministry of Finance, with the February plan now deferred. The bonds were initially planned for launch in the first week of February, but incomplete internal preparations led to the delay, with the Ministry of Finance remaining optimistic about launching the bonds next month.</p>
<p>The bond was announced to be a green Panda bond targeting $250 million to support sustainable, climate-resilient investment. Pakistan hoped to launch the inaugural Panda bond before Chinese New Year, with access to China&#39;s capital market helping reduce reliance on dollar-denominated borrowing. Two non-deal roadshows had already been completed and credit enhancement was approved by the Asian Development Bank, with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank expected to follow.</p>
<p>The most recent reports from February 2026 indicate the issuance has been delayed again, now expected in March 2026. The delays highlight the challenges Pakistan faces in accessing international capital markets despite improvement in its overall economic situation from the near-default conditions of 2023. Successfully completing the Panda bond issuance would mark an important milestone in Pakistan&#39;s financial recovery and demonstrate renewed confidence from international investors in the country&#39;s economic trajectory.</p>

<h3>10. Core PCE Inflation Expected at 3.0% Year-Over-Year as Friday Data Dump Approaches</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19–20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wall Street is bracing for Friday&#39;s simultaneous release of Q4 2025 GDP, December PCE inflation, and personal income/spending data, with core PCE expected at 0.4% month-over-month which would push year-over-year core PCE to approximately 3.0%—well above the Fed&#39;s 2% target and potentially eliminating any possibility of rate cuts before summer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The economic calendar for Friday, February 20 features three critical data releases scheduled simultaneously: the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish the advance estimate of Q4 2025 GDP growth, December PCE inflation reading (the Fed&#39;s preferred inflation gauge), and December personal income/spending data. The consolidated data dump represents what MarketMinute analysts described as an &quot;inflection point&quot; for first-half 2026 monetary policy, with potential to either validate Fed rate cut expectations for mid-year or push them significantly further out.</p>
<p>Consensus estimates call for Q4 GDP growth of 2.8% annualized, a notable cooling from Q3&#39;s 4.4% but still comfortably above the 1.8-2.0% &quot;neutral&quot; rate economists associate with non-inflationary growth. Core PCE is expected at 0.4% month-over-month, which if realized would push year-over-year core PCE to approximately 3.0%—a sharp acceleration from late 2025&#39;s 0.2% monthly readings and well above the Fed&#39;s 2% target. The combination of solid growth and reaccelerating inflation would validate the FOMC&#39;s hawkish pause and likely eliminate any possibility of rate cuts before summer.</p>
<p>The stakes are particularly high given the federal government shutdown that disrupted December economic activity and DOGE-driven spending cuts expected to register in GDP data. A reading below 1.5% combined with PCE above 2.8% would present a stagflation scenario—slowing growth with sticky inflation—that would leave the Fed paralyzed between competing mandates. Conversely, if growth proves stronger than expected while inflation moderates, markets could interpret that as a &quot;Goldilocks&quot; outcome justifying gradual rate cuts starting mid-year.</p>

<h2>Geopolitical News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Pakistan Launches Strikes on Afghan Militant Camps, Taliban Reports Dozens Killed</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 22</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pakistan carried out airstrikes on seven militant camps across the border in Afghanistan on Sunday, with its military conducting &quot;intelligence-based, selective operations&quot; against groups it blames for recent deadly attacks, while Afghanistan&#39;s Defense Ministry reported &quot;dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children&quot; were killed when strikes hit residential areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strikes targeted the Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) and its affiliates, as well as a group associated with the Islamic State. Pakistan&#39;s State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry said nearly 70 militants were killed in the operations targeting terrorist hideouts along the Pakistan-Afghan border, while Afghanistan&#39;s Red Crescent Society reported 18 civilians dead and several wounded in eastern Nangarhar province.</p>
<p>The military action follows a devastating suicide bombing on February 6 that killed at least 31 worshippers and wounded 170 others during noon prayers at a mosque in Islamabad&#39;s Tarlai Kalan area. The Islamic State Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the Islamabad attack, which marked one of the deadliest terrorist incidents in Pakistan&#39;s capital in recent years.</p>
<p>Afghanistan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Pakistan&#39;s Ambassador in Kabul to protest the strikes and vowed to &quot;deliver an appropriate and calculated response.&quot; The escalation highlights deepening tensions between the two neighbors, with Islamabad accusing Kabul of harboring militants who stage cross-border attacks, while the Taliban government denies allowing armed groups to use Afghan territory for operations in Pakistan.</p>
<h3>2. Former Prince Andrew Arrested on Epstein-Related Misconduct Charges in Historic Royal Detention</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, was arrested on his 66th birthday on suspicion of misconduct in public office following revelations that he allegedly shared confidential government documents with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while serving as UK trade envoy, marking the first arrest of a member of the royal family in centuries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thames Valley Police detained Andrew for 11 hours before releasing him &quot;under investigation,&quot; meaning he has been neither charged nor exonerated. The arrest followed the release of emails by the U.S. Department of Justice showing Mountbatten-Windsor apparently sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, and sending Epstein a confidential brief on investment opportunities in Afghanistan during his 2010 tenure as trade envoy.</p>
<p>If charged with misconduct in public office, the offense carries a maximum possible sentence of life in prison in Britain. King Charles III expressed his &quot;deepest concern&quot; about the case and stressed that &quot;the law must take its course,&quot; signaling that the monarchy would not interfere with the judicial process despite the unprecedented nature of prosecuting a former senior royal.</p>
<p>The UK government is weighing whether to remove the former prince from the line of succession amid the Epstein probe. Parliament could pass legislation stripping him of succession rights, though such a move would be historically extraordinary and require careful constitutional consideration given the precedent it would set for future cases involving royal family members.</p>
<h3>3. South Korea Sentences Former President Yoon Suk Yeol to Life in Prison for Insurrection</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A South Korean court sentenced former President Yoon Suk Yeol to life in prison after finding him guilty of leading an insurrection during his short-lived imposition of martial law in December 2024, when armed soldiers descended on parliament by helicopter and attempted to storm the legislative chamber where lawmakers were gathered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon ruled that Yoon&#39;s intention in declaring martial law was clearly to paralyze the National Assembly for a significant period, and that dispatching armed soldiers to the parliament building and transporting them by helicopter constituted acts of insurrection. The prosecution had requested the death penalty, but the court imposed life imprisonment instead.</p>
<p>The December 3, 2024 martial law declaration lasted only hours before lawmakers voted to overturn it, but the attempted power grab triggered months of political turmoil culminating in Yoon&#39;s impeachment, arrest, and trial. Former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo received 23 years in prison, becoming the first Yoon administration official convicted of insurrection charges, while former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun was sentenced to 30 years.</p>
<p>Yoon, who can appeal the ruling, denied the insurrection charge and still faces six pending trials filed by special prosecutors, covering charges ranging from espionage and perjury to abuse of power and election law violations. At 65 years old and in declining health after months of detention, Yoon faces spending his remaining years in prison unless appellate courts overturn the verdict.</p>
<h3>4. Over 1,000 Kenyans Recruited to Fight for Russia in Ukraine, Intelligence Report Reveals</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 21</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight on Russia&#39;s side in the Ukraine war according to a Kenyan intelligence report presented to lawmakers, five times more than authorities had previously estimated, with recruitment agencies colluding with rogue airport staff, immigration officials, and Russian Embassy personnel to facilitate the trafficking operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of February 2026, 89 Kenyans were on the Ukrainian frontline, 39 hospitalized, 28 missing in action, 30 repatriated, one detained, and at least one death confirmed. The recruiters targeted former soldiers and police officers, as well as unemployed people, with promises of earning 350,000 shillings ($2,715) per month and bonuses up to 1.2 million shillings ($9,309).</p>
<p>Those enlisted initially left Kenya on tourist visas and travelled to Russia via Turkey or the United Arab Emirates. After Kenya tightened surveillance at Nairobi airport, the recruits started travelling via Uganda, South Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo. Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing&#39;Oei has held high-level discussions with Ukraine&#39;s Ambassador regarding the safety and possible repatriation of Kenyans captured on the frontlines.</p>
<p>The Russian Embassy in Nairobi denied on Thursday that Moscow was involved in illegally recruiting Kenyans to fight in Ukraine, though it acknowledged that foreign citizens could voluntarily join its armed forces. The revelations have sparked domestic outrage in Kenya and raised questions about how hundreds of citizens were trafficked to a war zone despite government assurances of enhanced border security and vigilance against human trafficking networks.</p>
<h3>5. China&#39;s Top General Zhang Youxia Arrested in Xi&#39;s Sweeping Military Purge</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission and China&#39;s most senior general, was arrested on corruption allegations in a stunning move that hollowed out the country&#39;s top military body and confirmed President Xi Jinping&#39;s far-reaching power over the People&#39;s Liberation Army.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until recently, Zhang&#39;s abrupt sidelining was largely unexpected due to his long military tenure and perceived closeness with Xi. He served alongside Xi&#39;s father when the two were Communist fighters in the country&#39;s northwest, and the younger Zhang and Xi, now 75 and 72, are both &quot;princelings&quot;—children of revolutionary-era Communist Party leaders.</p>
<p>Zhang&#39;s arrest &quot;increases the risk of a miscalculation&quot; regarding Taiwan, said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London, as there are fewer generals who would challenge Xi&#39;s decisions. Xi has reached a &quot;tipping point&quot; in his battle to bring the PLA &quot;under his absolute personal control,&quot; furthering his long-term goal of building a force &quot;capable of conquering Taiwan and prevailing in a potential confrontation&quot; with the U.S.</p>
<p>The purge represents the most significant anti-corruption campaign in the Chinese military since Xi came to power in 2012, with dozens of senior officers dismissed or investigated over the past year. Defense analysts warn that the extensive purges could temporarily weaken military readiness as new commanders establish authority and institutional knowledge is lost, though Xi appears willing to accept short-term disruption to ensure absolute loyalty in the officer corps.</p>
<h3>6. Japan&#39;s Prime Minister Takaichi Wins Historic Supermajority, BOJ Faces Policy Dilemma</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japan&#39;s first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, led the Liberal Democratic Party to a historic landslide on February 8, winning 316 of 465 seats in the House of Representatives—a 68% majority representing the largest single-party dominance in Japan&#39;s post-war democratic history, while Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda faces mounting pressure over interest rate policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LDP won a historic landslide victory, regaining its majority and setting a new postwar record with 316 seats, giving the party a two-thirds supermajority in its own right. The election results came nearly four months into Takaichi&#39;s tenure, which began on October 21, 2025, and delivered her an overwhelming mandate to pursue controversial policies including constitutional reform.</p>
<p>Governor Kazuo Ueda is facing the most difficult choice of his career, as by the end of 2025, the Bank of Japan had pushed the policy rate to 0.75%, the highest level in 30 years. The market generally expects the BOJ to raise interest rates again to 1.0% or even higher by mid-2026, creating significant tension between Takaichi&#39;s massive fiscal expansion and the central bank&#39;s monetary tightening.</p>
<p>The government is engaging in massive fiscal expansion while the central bank tries to tighten—an operation of &quot;stepping on both the gas and the brake&quot; that will greatly exacerbate volatility in the yen exchange rate. Takaichi entered the election with a ¥21 trillion economic stimulus package as the core of her government&#39;s economic agenda, dubbed &#39;Sanaenomics&#39;, intended to combat rising prices but raising concerns about fiscal sustainability.</p>
<h3>7. U.S. Pressures NATO to Reduce Kosovo and Iraq Missions in &quot;Return to Factory Settings&quot;</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States is putting pressure on NATO to reduce the KFOR mission in Kosovo and scale back operations in Iraq, according to NATO diplomats, as Washington signals it wants the alliance to focus on core Euro-Atlantic defense rather than &quot;out-of-area activities,&quot; in what has become internally known as a &quot;return to factory settings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The USA has signaled that it wants to reduce KFOR forces in Kosovo, though discussions are still in a very early stage. These activities by Washington reflect the White House&#39;s aspiration to treat NATO as a strictly Euro-Atlantic defense pact, with the alliance being asked to reduce operations outside its core tasks of defense and deterrence in the North Atlantic region.</p>
<p>NATO has been leading a peace-support operation in Kosovo—the Kosovo Force (KFOR)—since June 1999 in support of wider international efforts to build peace and stability in the area. The NATO-led mission continues to contribute to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all people and communities living in Kosovo and freedom of movement, but the Trump administration views these stabilization operations as distracting from deterring Russia.</p>
<p>The U.S. request faces resistance within the alliance, with not all NATO members sharing this opinion and some diplomats stating that &quot;giving up on the alliance&#39;s overseas initiatives is not the right approach.&quot; European allies worry that withdrawing from long-standing peacekeeping missions could create security vacuums that Russia, China, or other actors might exploit, undermining Western credibility in crisis regions.</p>
<h3>8. U.S. Completes Withdrawal from Al-Asad Airbase, Iraq Announces End of Federal Territory Presence</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 18-20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States completed its withdrawal from al-Asad air base in Iraq&#39;s Anbar Province in mid-January 2026, bringing to a close more than two decades of American military presence in western Iraq&#39;s federal territory, though roughly 300 advisors and security personnel remain at Harir Air Base in the Kurdistan Region to support counter-ISIS operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iraq&#39;s government announced that US forces had completed a &quot;full withdrawal&quot; from military facilities within the country&#39;s federal territory, excluding the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region where US troops remain. The withdrawal was part of an agreement signed in late September for a phased departure by the end of 2026, with forces in Iraq proper relocated to Kurdistan by September 2025 and most remaining troops scheduled to leave Iraq altogether by September 2026.</p>
<p>A unit of roughly 300 advisors and security personnel will remain at Harir Air Base in Erbil province to support intelligence and surveillance efforts with U.S. forces in Syria conducting counter-ISIL operations. The withdrawal represents a significant milestone in U.S.-Iraq relations, though it&#39;s not a complete departure as American personnel remain in the Kurdistan region.</p>
<p>The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to reduce U.S. military commitments in the Middle East and refocus resources on great power competition with China, while Iraqi lawmakers from Shia political parties have long pushed for complete U.S. withdrawal. Security analysts warn that the drawdown could create opportunities for ISIS remnants to reconstitute, though Iraqi security forces maintain they are capable of managing residual terrorist threats independently.</p>
<h3>9. Munich Security Conference Exposes Deep Divisions as Democrats Struggle to Define Alternative to Trump</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 13-15</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 62nd Munich Security Conference exposed profound uncertainty about the future of U.S. foreign policy as Democratic presidential hopefuls descended on the event but found European leaders &quot;see us as a wrecking ball&quot; and largely ignoring them while assuming leaders like Donald Trump will define the future, according to California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Multiple potential 2028 presidential candidates attended, including Gavin Newsom, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Kelly, Gretchen Whitmer, and Senators Chris Murphy, Elissa Slotkin, and Ruben Gallego. Even as Democrats arrived to reassure allies that another United States still existed—one committed to alliances, multilateralism, and the liberal international order—their very presence underscored the fragility of that promise.</p>
<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made headlines for a massive stumble when asked whether the U.S. should send troops to defend Taiwan from a possible invasion by China, appearing to stall for nearly 20 seconds before offering that the U.S. should try to avoid reaching a clash with China over Taiwan. The gaffe drew sharp criticism and raised questions about progressive Democrats&#39; readiness to articulate coherent foreign policy alternatives.</p>
<p>European officials could not ignore the structural reality that US foreign policy now appeared contingent on domestic electoral outcomes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio represented the Trump administration and received praise from some attendees for articulating clear positions, while Democratic attendees struggled to gain traction with European leaders focused on navigating the current administration rather than potential future alternatives.</p>
<h3>10. Hong Kong Tycoon Jimmy Lai Sentenced to 20 Years, China Summons Western Envoys Over Criticism</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hong Kong activist and media entrepreneur Jimmy Lai was sentenced to 20 years in prison under the National Security Law on February 9, including charges of &quot;collusion with foreign forces&quot; and conspiring to publish &quot;seditious&quot; material, prompting China to summon the heads of UK, U.S., Australian and European Union missions on February 15 after their governments criticized the prosecution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 78 years old and in rapidly declining health, Lai, a British citizen and prisoner of conscience who has already endured over five years&#39; imprisonment in solitary confinement, faces spending his final years in prison. The EU deplored the heavy sentence as a politically motivated prosecution that undermines Hong Kong&#39;s autonomy and judicial independence under the &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot; framework.</p>
<p>China&#39;s foreign ministry commissioner&#39;s office in Hong Kong said it expressed &quot;strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition&quot; and urged those governments to respect China&#39;s sovereignty and Hong Kong&#39;s rule of law, stop &quot;irresponsible&quot; remarks on national security cases and cease interfering in Hong Kong and China&#39;s internal affairs. The UK Foreign Secretary criticized the sentencing as evidence of Hong Kong&#39;s deteriorating freedoms under Chinese control.</p>
<p>The case represents one of the highest-profile prosecutions under the National Security Law imposed by Beijing in 2020, which has been used to dismantle Hong Kong&#39;s pro-democracy movement and silence dissent. Western governments view Lai&#39;s imprisonment as emblematic of China&#39;s systematic erosion of Hong Kong&#39;s promised autonomy, while Beijing insists the law is necessary to restore stability after the 2019 pro-democracy protests.</p>
<h3>11. Thailand&#39;s Conservative Bhumjaithai Party Wins Surprise Election Victory</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thailand&#39;s conservative Bhumjaithai Party secured a stunning election victory on February 8, winning 193 seats in the House of Representatives and marking the first time this century that a party aligned with the country&#39;s royalist establishment has won at the ballot box, while voters also approved drafting a new constitution with roughly 19 million supporting the measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General elections saw Prime Minister Anutin Chittchawong&#39;s Bhumjaithai Party substantially outperform pre-election polls, defeating the People&#39;s Party (118 seats) and Pheu Thai (74 seats). The election was a rare victory for conservatism and nationalism in Thailand, with Bhumjaithai benefiting from nationalist sentiments after Thailand&#39;s recent clash with Cambodia over border disputes.</p>
<p>A referendum held concurrently asked whether the 2017 constitution should be replaced with a new one, with roughly 19 million Thais voting in favor of drafting a new constitution, while 10 million rejected the idea, and almost three million voted &quot;no opinion.&quot; The referendum result gives Bhumjaithai a mandate to pursue constitutional reform that could strengthen executive power and traditional institutions.</p>
<p>The outcome has significant implications for Thailand&#39;s role in regional geopolitics, particularly regarding relations with China and the United States. The contest reflected deep political realignment, though Bhumjaithai&#39;s pro-establishment orientation likely means continued careful balancing between the major powers while maintaining Thailand&#39;s traditional foreign policy pragmatism.</p>
<h3>12. Bangladesh Holds Post-Revolution Election Amid Islamist Challenge</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 12</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bangladesh held parliamentary elections and a constitutional referendum on February 12, 2026, following the 2024 Monsoon Revolution and the fall of Sheikh Hasina, with the contest reflecting a deep political realignment as the BNP faced an increasingly competitive Islamist challenge led by Jamaat-e-Islami and its alliance with youth-based movements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The election took place in a transformed political landscape after the revolution that toppled Hasina&#39;s government in 2024. The BNP remained favored but faced unexpected competition from Islamist parties that gained significant support among younger voters disillusioned with both traditional parties and seeking more radical change in governance and social policies.</p>
<p>The constitutional referendum on the post-revolution reform package known as the July Charter addressed fundamental questions about Bangladesh&#39;s political structure, including executive powers, judicial independence, and the role of religion in governance. The vote was watched closely by regional powers including India, China, and Pakistan, all of whom have strategic interests in Bangladesh&#39;s political direction.</p>
<p>International observers expressed concerns about isolated incidents of violence and intimidation but generally characterized the election as credible despite the challenging security environment. The results will shape Bangladesh&#39;s trajectory for years to come, particularly regarding economic policy, relations with neighboring India, and the balance between secular and religious influences in governance.</p>
<h3>13. New START Nuclear Arms Treaty Expires, Ending Five Decades of U.S.-Russia Strategic Limits</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New START treaty officially expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time in more than half a century that no binding limits exist on U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned the world now faces unprecedented risk without legally binding constraints on the two largest nuclear powers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under its provisions, New START could not be extended beyond February 5, 2026. The treaty had limited deployed strategic nuclear warheads for each party to 1,550—down nearly two-thirds from the original START treaty—and restricted deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments to 800 for each nation.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals&quot; of the two countries, according to Guterres. This represents the first time since the early 1970s that there will be no legally binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces without another agreement being under negotiation.</p>
<p>Trump has suggested that if New START expires, a &quot;better&quot; agreement could be negotiated and said that China should be included. After the expiration, the Trump administration stated that a new nuclear arms control treaty should include China, though Beijing has shown little interest in trilateral arms control negotiations given its significantly smaller nuclear arsenal compared to the U.S. and Russia.</p>
<h3>14. Trump Administration Slashes Foreign Aid, USAID Elimination Linked to 600,000 Deaths</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration submitted a $9.4 billion rescission package to Congress targeting core foreign assistance accounts including global health programs, development aid, humanitarian response, and contributions to multilateral institutions, with Congress later approving rescissions allowing the president to cut around $7.9 billion in foreign assistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration&#39;s decision to eliminate USAID resulted in 600,000 deaths by November 5, 2025, two-thirds of which were children, according to public health analyses. Almost exactly one year ago, USAID&#39;s dismantling began, and the State Department officially absorbed the agency in July 2025, fundamentally restructuring U.S. development assistance delivery.</p>
<p>The Trump administration later launched an $11 billion America First Global Health Strategy to fill the gap, intending to foster U.S. influence in developing nations while promoting self-reliance. Sharp cuts to foreign aid have hindered global efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation and other public health priorities, including funding reductions from both the U.S. and U.K.</p>
<p>The fiscal year 2026 budget request featured devastating cuts to foreign assistance spending, slashing global health and humanitarian assistance while repackaging development assistance in an &quot;America First&quot; fund. International development organizations warned that the restructuring and budget cuts undermine decades of progress on global health, food security, and poverty reduction, while creating opportunities for China to expand its influence through development financing.</p>
<h3>15. Myanmar Military Junta Secures Landslide Victory in Sham Elections</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Dec 2025 - Jan 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myanmar held three-phase elections beginning December 28, 2025, which produced a preordained outcome as the Union Solidarity and Development Party—the military&#39;s political party—won a landslide on abysmal voter turnout of 13.1 million votes, compared with 25.9 million votes cast in the 2020 general election that the junta nullified after seizing power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voting was held in three phases: Phase 1 (December 28, 2025), Phase 2 (January 11, 2026), and Phase 3 (January 25, 2026). The staged process allowed the junta to manage security concerns and suppress dissent while creating a facade of democratic legitimacy for the military-backed government that has ruled Myanmar since the February 2021 coup.</p>
<p>International observers and pro-democracy activists characterized the elections as a &quot;sham&quot; and &quot;scam&quot; designed to legitimize military rule rather than provide genuine democratic choice. The National Unity Government—the opposition coalition including deposed civilian leaders—called for a boycott and dismissed the results as fraudulent.</p>
<p>The dramatically reduced turnout reflects widespread rejection of the junta&#39;s political process, with many citizens boycotting the vote or unable to participate due to conflict and displacement. The international community, including the UN, EU, and ASEAN, largely refused to recognize the election&#39;s legitimacy, though some neighboring countries have maintained pragmatic engagement with Myanmar&#39;s military regime despite the democratic rollback.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Danaher Closes $9.9 Billion Acquisition of Masimo in Largest Medtech Deal in Five Years</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Danaher completed its acquisition of medical technology company Masimo Corporation for $180.00 per share in cash, representing a total consideration of $9.9 billion—Danaher&#39;s largest deal in more than five years since the $21.4 billion purchase of Cytiva, as shares rallied 33% following initial reports of the transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deal values Masimo well above its market capitalization of nearly $7 billion prior to acquisition talks, with the $180 per share price representing a substantial premium. Masimo will become a standalone operating company within Danaher&#39;s Diagnostics segment alongside Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, Cepheid and Beckman Coulter Diagnostics.</p>
<p>The transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2026 and is subject to customary conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory clearances and Masimo shareholder approval. Masimo is known for its pulse oximetry technology and patient monitoring systems, which complement Danaher&#39;s existing diagnostics and life sciences portfolio.</p>
<p>The acquisition reflects continued consolidation in the medical technology sector as large companies seek to acquire innovative platforms with established revenue streams rather than investing in uncertain early-stage research and development. Healthcare analysts view the deal as strategically sound given Masimo&#39;s strong market position in critical care monitoring and recurring revenue from consumables, though some questioned whether Danaher overpaid given Masimo&#39;s recent operational challenges.</p>
<h3>2. Blue Owl Capital Halts Quarterly Redemptions, Triggers Private Credit Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 18</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blue Owl Capital Corporation II stopped offering quarterly redemption opportunities for its private, retail-facing debt fund on February 18, replacing it with a mandatory liquidation model funded by loan repayments and asset sales, while simultaneously executing a massive $1.4 billion sale of loan assets to fortify its balance sheet and appease restless shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The move sparked widespread concern about stress in the booming $1.7 trillion private credit market, with shares of Blue Owl falling roughly 6% and Apollo Global and Blackstone shares falling more than 5% following the announcement. Blue Owl stated that payouts would be about 30% of the fund&#39;s net asset value to all shareholders within 45 days under the new distribution plan—a much larger payout than would have been available under the quarterly tender system.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a canary in the coal mine,&quot; Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. &quot;The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst.&quot; The Blue Owl fund had traditionally allowed investors to exit up to 5% of their holdings quarterly, providing liquidity that differentiated private credit from traditional illiquid private equity investments.</p>
<p>The redemption freeze raises fundamental questions about liquidity management in private credit funds marketed to retail investors, who typically expect greater access to their capital than institutional investors in locked-up vehicles. Regulators and industry observers are closely monitoring whether Blue Owl&#39;s situation represents an isolated incident or signals broader stress in private credit markets as interest rates remain elevated and some borrowers face refinancing difficulties.</p>
<h3>3. Norwegian Cruise Line Faces Activist Push as Elliott Builds 10%+ Stake</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Activist investor Elliott Investment Management built a stake of more than 10% in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and plans to push for changes at the struggling cruise operator, making Elliott one of NCLH&#39;s largest shareholders and sending shares up 7.5% on reports of the investment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elliott, which manages more than $79 billion in assets and is known for high-profile activist campaigns, is expected to engage with Norwegian&#39;s management and board in an effort to address operational and financial underperformance. Elliott reportedly believes improvements in areas such as destination development, guest experience, and financial discipline could help narrow the performance gap with larger rivals Royal Caribbean and Carnival Corporation.</p>
<p>The timing is significant as it coincides with leadership changes within Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Following Harry Sommer&#39;s departure in February 2026, John Chidsey took over as CEO and Chairman of the board. As part of its engagement, Elliott has been privately working with Adam Goldstein, the former president and chief operating officer of Royal Caribbean, as a potential board nominee at Norwegian.</p>
<p>Cruise industry analysts view the activist involvement as potentially positive for Norwegian, which has lagged competitors in post-pandemic recovery and faces challenges including ship maintenance issues, itinerary optimization, and yield management. However, Elliott&#39;s campaigns sometimes create management distraction and tension between short-term financial engineering and long-term strategic investments.</p>
<h3>4. Walmart Reports Strong Holiday Sales but Issues Cautious Outlook on Consumer Pressures</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walmart reported that holiday-quarter sales rose nearly 6% with earnings per share of 74 cents adjusted versus 73 cents expected and revenue of $190.66 billion versus $190.43 billion expected, but the retailer offered cautious guidance for fiscal 2026 that fell short of Wall Street expectations, citing pressure on lower-income consumers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparable sales jumped 4.6% for Walmart&#39;s U.S. business and 4% for Sam&#39;s Club in the fourth quarter, excluding fuel, while e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 27% compared with the year-ago period. The digital growth was fueled by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery of online orders, along with the retailer&#39;s third-party marketplace and advertising business.</p>
<p>For the full current fiscal year, Walmart said it expects net sales to increase by 3.5% to 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.75 to $2.85. That earnings outlook fell short of Wall Street&#39;s expectations of $2.96 per share, reflecting concerns about consumer spending patterns and margin pressure from wage inflation and supply chain costs.</p>
<p>Throughout late 2025 and into early 2026, the company reported that approximately 75% of its market share gains came from households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000. However, the company acknowledged &quot;some pressure on the lowest income cohort,&quot; with spending among the highest earners compared to lower-income groups &quot;had gapped out a little bit,&quot; highlighting the bifurcated consumer economy.</p>
<h3>5. Big Tech AI Spending Approaches $700 Billion as Amazon Announces $200 Billion Capex Plan</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are expected to spend nearly $700 billion combined in 2026 to fuel their AI build-outs, with Amazon leading the field by announcing a $200 billion capital expenditure plan—far exceeding consensus expectations of $147 billion and representing the largest single-year capex commitment by any technology company in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alphabet expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion—more than double its 2025 spend and exceeding the forecasts of its hyperscaler peers. The vast majority of spending will go toward AI chips, servers, and data center infrastructure, with Alphabet noting that approximately 60% of Q4 investment went to servers and 40% to data centers and networking equipment.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s capital expenses reached $37.5 billion in Q2 2026, up 66% and exceeding analyst estimates, with roughly two-thirds for short-lived assets like GPUs and CPUs. Microsoft&#39;s stock dropped over 6% in after-hours trading on concerns about capital expenditure levels despite strong earnings and growth in AI and cloud services.</p>
<p>The unprecedented spending levels reflect intense competition to build AI infrastructure and capture market share in generative AI applications, but also raise questions about return on investment. Corporate earnings showed performance divergence, with Microsoft shedding 7.7% on capital expenditure concerns while Meta rallied 8.8% after raising its 2026 sales projection, demonstrating that investors are differentiating between companies based on their ability to monetize AI investments.</p>
<h3>6. LyondellBasell Faces Credit Downgrade Warning, Dividend Cut Concerns Mount</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-21.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LyondellBasell is facing a credit warning from S&amp;P Global that has put the company&#39;s dividend reliability into the spotlight, with investors pricing in the risk of a dividend cut following the S&amp;P &quot;CreditWatch Negative&quot; placement on February 18, 2026, sending shares tumbling as retail investors worried about potential payout reductions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chemicals company is facing significant challenges including overcapacity in Asian markets and high energy costs in Europe. Fiscal year 2025 was a &quot;trough&quot; year for LyondellBasell, with revenues declining to approximately $30.2 billion from $40+ billion levels in 2023, though much of this was due to planned divestitures and refinery closures.</p>
<p>While no actual dividend cut has been announced yet, retail investors are primarily concerned with the dividend, and any sign of a payout reduction would likely trigger a significant retail sell-off. As of February 2026, Wall Street is in a &quot;wait and see&quot; mode with a consensus &quot;Hold/Neutral&quot; rating on the stock.</p>
<p>LyondellBasell is attempting to pivot toward circular economy business models including chemical recycling and sustainable materials, but the transition requires significant capital investment at a time when traditional petrochemical margins are compressed. The company&#39;s situation illustrates broader challenges facing traditional chemical manufacturers as they navigate the energy transition, overcapacity in key markets, and the need to maintain shareholder returns while investing in transformation.</p>
<h3>7. S&amp;P 500 Companies Report 13.2% Q4 Earnings Growth, Tech Leads with 25% Expansion</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-22.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Q4 2025, 74% of S&amp;P 500 companies reported positive earnings surprises and 73% reported positive revenue surprises, with a blended earnings growth rate of 13.2%—marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth and the tenth straight quarter of annual earnings expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blended revenue growth rate for Q4 2025 is 9.0%, which would mark the highest revenue growth rate since Q3 2022 (11.0%). Three sectors are reporting double-digit revenue growth: Information Technology, Communication Services, and Health Care, with the technology sector posting explosive 25% year-over-year earnings growth driven by AI infrastructure investments and strong cloud computing demand.</p>
<p>For Q1 2026 and Q2 2026, analysts are forecasting earnings growth rates of 11.3% and 14.9% respectively, with full year 2026 earnings growth projected at 14.1%. The forward 12-month P/E ratio is 21.5, above the 5-year average of 20.0 and the 10-year average of 18.8, raising questions about whether equity valuations adequately reflect economic and policy risks.</p>
<p>However, the earnings strength masks significant divergence between AI beneficiaries and the broader market. Technology giants investing heavily in AI infrastructure are reporting explosive revenue and profit growth, while traditional cyclical sectors face margin pressure from tariffs, wage inflation, and slowing global demand. The concentration of earnings growth in a handful of mega-cap stocks raises sustainability questions if AI monetization disappoints.</p>
<h3>8. Bank of America Survey Shows Historic Shift Away from U.S. Equities</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-23.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The February 2026 Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey revealed a pronounced rotation away from U.S. assets toward emerging markets and Europe, with emerging-market allocations rising to a net 49% overweight—the highest since February 2021—while investors are net 22% underweight U.S. equities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The survey covered 190 institutional fund managers with $512 billion under management and depicted an exceptionally optimistic investor backdrop, with overall sentiment reaching its most bullish level since June 2021. U.S. equities fell by 20 percentage points from near-neutral in January, with most of that reduction reallocated to Eurozone and emerging-market equities.</p>
<p>Eurozone equities climbed to a net 35% overweight, while February also saw a rotation toward Energy, Materials and Staples, and away from U.S. equities, Tech and the U.S. dollar. The survey indicates a historic shift in institutional capital flows, with the largest rotation away from US equities toward emerging markets in five years.</p>
<p>The positioning shift reflects concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability, tariff impacts on profit margins, Federal Reserve policy uncertainty, and relative valuation as U.S. stocks trade at significant premiums to international markets. However, some strategists caution that such extreme positioning changes can sometimes signal contrarian opportunities if U.S. markets stabilize and outperform expectations.</p>
<h3>9. Oil Prices Surge Above $70 on Iran Tensions Before Pulling Back</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-24.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19-20</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil prices surged more than 4% to top $70 per barrel on February 19 after traders reacted to escalating U.S.-Iran tensions, with Brent crude reaching $71.47 and WTI hitting $66.29 before stabilizing as both contracts were set to notch roughly 5.3% weekly gains amid heightened geopolitical risk premiums.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump ramped up pressure on Iran, warning it to strike a deal on its nuclear program within 10 days or face &quot;bad things,&quot; while both countries increased military activity near the Strait of Hormuz—one of the world&#39;s most important oil transit routes through which roughly a fifth of global oil flows. U.S. commercial crude inventories slipped by 9.0 million barrels last week, landing at 419.8 million barrels, adding support to prices.</p>
<p>The EIA noted that escalating tensions with Iran put upward pressure on prices, though they expect oil prices will decline in 2026 as global oil production exceeds demand, forecasting Brent will average $58 per barrel in 2026. The divergence between short-term geopolitical risk premiums and longer-term supply-demand fundamentals creates volatility that complicates energy policy and investment decisions.</p>
<p>Energy analysts project crude prices will remain range-bound in the $60-70 range through mid-2026 barring major geopolitical shocks, with the balance between growing non-OPEC supply and uncertain global demand creating a cap on price appreciation. Chinese economic weakness, electric vehicle adoption acceleration, and efficiency gains in transportation continue to moderate long-term demand forecasts.</p>
<h3>10. Federal Reserve Holds Rates at 3.5%-3.75%, Minutes Reveal Division on Future Path</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-25.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 28 / Feb 18</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve maintained its key interest rate in a range between 3.5% and 3.75% at its January 2026 meeting, putting a halt to three consecutive quarter-percentage-point reductions from late 2025, while minutes released February 18 revealed that some officials even considered the possibility of rate hikes if inflation persists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision followed inflation data showing consumer and wholesale prices remain elevated, with current data showing a 4.3% unemployment rate and persistent wage growth complicating monetary policy decisions. The median FOMC projection forecasts an inflation rate of 2.4% by the end of 2026, down from 2.6% in September, but still above the Fed&#39;s 2% target.</p>
<p>Futures markets are pricing in at most two rate reductions in 2026 and none in 2027, reflecting expectations the Fed will wait until at least June before adjusting its benchmark rate again. The minutes showed divided Fed officials indicated that further interest rate cuts should be paused for now and could resume later in the year only if inflation cooperates.</p>
<p>Powell emphasized that economic activity remains solid and the balance of risks to the Fed&#39;s dual mandate is improving, though current Chair Jerome Powell&#39;s term ends in May and President Trump&#39;s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair adds uncertainty to the monetary policy outlook. While Warsh has recently called for lower interest rates, he is expected to maintain a data-dependent approach rather than pursuing aggressive easing.</p>
<h3>11. Labor Market Stabilizes as Jobless Claims Fall to 206,000, Lowest Drop Since November</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-26.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initial jobless claims fell to 206,000 for the week ending February 14, representing a decrease of 23,000 from the previous week—the most significant drop since November—adding to evidence of labor market stabilization despite some underlying concerns about economic conditions and corporate restructuring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing claims (insured unemployment) increased to 1,869,000 for the week ending February 7, rising by 17,000, and the insured unemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.2 percent. The data reflects a stable labor market with slow firing momentum offsetting soft hiring momentum, consistent with the Federal Reserve&#39;s view.</p>
<p>Claims are hovering within the 200,000 to 250,000 range considered healthy by economists, indicating the labor market remains relatively resilient despite some underlying concerns. For the week ending February 7, initial jobless claims of 227,000 signaled that while hiring has slowed in many sectors, mass layoffs have not materialized despite widespread concerns about AI-driven automation and corporate cost-cutting.</p>
<p>The labor market data suggests the economy is achieving a &quot;soft landing&quot; scenario where inflation moderates without triggering recession or mass unemployment. However, economists note that forward-looking indicators suggest hiring will remain subdued as companies exercise caution about headcount growth amid uncertainty about tariff impacts, AI-driven productivity gains, and consumer spending sustainability.</p>
<h3>12. Commercial Office Vacancy Rate Falls to 18.2%, Manhattan and Miami Lead Recovery</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-27.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The national office vacancy rate reached 18.2% in January 2026, following a decrease of 150 basis points year-over-year, representing an improvement from the previous year though vacancy rates remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, while the national office listing rate averaged $32.55 per square foot—2.5% lower than values recorded 12 months prior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manhattan, N.Y., and Miami averaged some of the lowest vacancy rates among the top U.S. office markets in January, while the Phoenix office market reached an inflection point with vacancy declining year-over-year to 16.3% following 840,000 SF of positive net absorption in 2025. Minneapolis/Twin Cities maintained vacancy at 17.8%—the only large market in the region to finish below the national average.</p>
<p>Many major markets are seeing vacancy rates above 20%, indicating continued challenges in the office sector as companies embrace hybrid work policies and reduce physical office footprints. The market is experiencing a &quot;flight to quality&quot; dynamic where tenants are moving to newer, premium buildings with better amenities, leaving older properties with significantly higher vacancy rates.</p>
<p>The divergent recovery across markets and property types suggests the office sector faces years of adjustment as companies optimize real estate portfolios for hybrid work models. Class A properties in prime locations are seeing healthy demand and rising rents, while Class B and C properties struggle with elevated vacancies and face potential obsolescence requiring major capital investment or conversion to residential or other uses.</p>
<h3>13. Food Prices Rise 2.9% Year-Over-Year as Inflation Moderates from Recent Peaks</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-28.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 13</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average price of food in the United States rose by 2.9% in the 12 months ending January, after posting an annual increase of 3.1% for December, according to data published February 13, 2026, with &quot;food at home&quot; (grocery stores) logging year-over-year increases of 2.1% while &quot;food away from home&quot; (restaurants) rose 4.0%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data shows food inflation has moderated significantly from recent peaks, though prices remain elevated compared to 2019 levels. In the euro area, food inflation rose for the first time since July, though it remained relatively moderate, while the OECD showed food inflation and core inflation showed little change while energy inflation fell in December 2025.</p>
<p>According to the FAO&#39;s Food Price Monitoring bulletin from February 12, 2026, world maize prices remained broadly stable in January 2026, underpinned by ample global supplies, while developments in global wheat prices were mixed, reflecting differing influences across major exporters including winterkill risks, exchange rate movements, and the onset of new season harvests in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The moderating food inflation provides some relief to consumers but prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels, contributing to ongoing cost-of-living pressures particularly for lower-income households that spend a larger share of income on food and necessities. Agricultural commodity markets face uncertainty from weather patterns, trade policy changes, and shifting demand as alternative protein sources gain market share.</p>
<h3>14. Airline Industry Sees Record Demand Continue into 2026, Premium Travel Outpaces Economy</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-29.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demand continues to be strong in the aviation industry despite concerns around economic growth and consumer confidence, with air travel around the world seeing record-high demand in 2025 carrying into 2026, while premium airline traffic growth consistently outpaces economy travel with the largest carriers reporting significant upticks in premium cabin bookings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When comparing January 2026 prices to January 2025, U.S. airfares are up by 2.2%, while corporate travel airfares are forecast to rise 3.7% in 2026. Corporate travel budgets are projected to rise by 5% globally in 2026, with travel managers forecasting higher year-over-year hotel bookings, airline passenger volumes and airfares.</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association cited &quot;robust demand&quot; for premium travel in a December outlook, particularly in Asia, Europe and North America. About 61% of corporate travel survey respondents said they are &quot;very optimistic&quot; or &quot;somewhat optimistic&quot; about the outlook for 2026, up from 50% in the 2025 midyear survey.</p>
<p>Despite strong demand, airline costs may outpace revenues due to wage and inflation adjustments. Additionally, supply chain issues and decarbonization were significant challenges for the industry in 2025 and will likely continue to be challenges in 2026, as airlines balance the need to expand capacity with sustainability commitments and regulatory pressures to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<h3>15. Tesla Deliveries Plummet for Second Consecutive Year as EV Demand Weakens</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-30.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tesla reported an 8.6% drop in deliveries to 1.64 million for the full year 2025, delivering 418,227 EVs in Q4 2025—representing an 8.5% drop compared to 2024—as sales declined for two years in a row for the first time in the company&#39;s history, while BYD overtook Tesla as the world&#39;s largest EV maker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Musk acknowledged &quot;some blowback&quot; from his political involvement was hurting the company, while analysts expect the company to face challenges with demand again in 2026, with the average estimate for deliveries plunging to roughly 1.8 million vehicles. Musk stated that 2026 &quot;is going to be a very big CapEx year&quot; with CFO Vaibhav Taneja pegging total 2026 capex spend as &quot;more than $20 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>BYD sold 4,602,436 new energy vehicles in 2025, becoming the world&#39;s top EV maker and surpassing Tesla&#39;s deliveries. However, BYD sold just 83,249 battery electric passenger cars in January 2026—the lowest on a monthly basis since the company sold 121,748 cars in February 2024—though the company targets 1.3 million overseas shipments in 2026 (up 24% from 2025).</p>
<p>The divergent trajectories reflect intensifying global EV competition, with Chinese manufacturers offering lower-priced vehicles capturing market share while Western automakers struggle with profitability and demand challenges. Tariffs, charging infrastructure gaps, and consumer concerns about range and resale values continue to moderate EV adoption rates in key markets, though industry analysts expect long-term electrification trends to resume once these barriers are addressed.</p>

<h2>Fusion Energy</h2>
<h3>1. IEA Features Fusion in State of Energy Innovation 2026 Report - <em>Feb 17</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>International Energy Agency report recognizes fusion alongside other emerging technologies as accelerating toward commercialization at scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The International Energy Agency released its &quot;State of Energy Innovation 2026&quot; report on February 17, 2026, featuring fusion energy prominently alongside other emerging technologies as the global race to develop commercial fusion intensifies. The report puts fusion on equal footing with advanced grid technologies, hydrogen infrastructure, and next-generation solar systems—highlighting its status, key milestones, and challenges as it accelerates from laboratory demonstrations toward commercial power plants capable of delivering gigawatts to electricity grids.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes that fusion energy saw major engineering and technological breakthroughs throughout 2025, coupled with substantial commitments from private investors and governments worldwide. Recent initiatives reflect a strategic shift toward domestic commercialization roadmaps and projects, with the IEA noting that collaboration between public programs, private companies, and international partners will continue to be essential for testing and scale-up phases. The agency identifies advances in fusion energy among more than 150 notable innovation developments across the energy landscape, recognizing the field&#39;s transition from pure research toward engineering implementation.</p>
<p>The IEA report was released ahead of the IEA Energy Innovation Forum held February 18, 2026, in Paris, which included a dedicated breakout session titled &quot;From here to gigawatts of fusion energy.&quot; The forum brought together policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers to discuss pathways for scaling fusion from current experimental facilities producing fusion reactions for fractions of seconds to commercial power plants delivering continuous electricity. The report notes that while fusion has faced decades of skepticism as perpetually &quot;30 years away,&quot; the convergence of private capital, advanced materials, AI-assisted plasma control, and multiple competing technological approaches—magnetic confinement tokamaks, stellarators, and inertial fusion—has fundamentally changed the commercialization timeline. With companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems targeting 2030s grid delivery and government programs accelerating development, the IEA&#39;s recognition signals fusion&#39;s emergence from scientific curiosity to credible clean energy solution.</p>
<h3>2. Helion Energy Achieves 150 Million Degree Milestone Racing Toward 2028 Microsoft Deadline - <em>Feb 13</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Fusion startup hits critical temperature threshold using pulsed magnetic compression approach, advancing commercial power delivery timeline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Helion Energy announced on February 13, 2026, that its seventh-generation Polaris prototype reactor achieved plasma temperatures exceeding 150 million degrees Celsius—approximately three-quarters of the temperature required for sustained commercial fusion power generation. The milestone demonstrates substantial progress toward Helion&#39;s unprecedented commitment to deliver electricity to Microsoft by 2028 under what would be the world&#39;s first commercial fusion power purchase agreement.</p>
<p>Helion&#39;s Polaris device achieved this blistering temperature using a fundamentally different approach than conventional tokamaks. Rather than maintaining steady-state plasma in doughnut-shaped magnetic cages requiring expensive superconducting magnets, Helion uses pulsed magnetic compression in a linear configuration. The system creates two plasma rings at opposite ends of a 40-foot chamber, accelerates them toward each other at over one million miles per hour, then compresses them together with powerful magnetic fields. This compression simultaneously heats plasma to fusion temperatures while generating the magnetic fields needed for confinement—a self-sustaining process that eliminates the need for costly external magnets. Polaris also became the first privately developed fusion machine to demonstrate measurable deuterium-tritium fusion reactions.</p>
<p>The temperature achievement is particularly significant because approximately 100 million degrees Celsius is considered the minimum threshold for sustained commercial fusion power, making Helion&#39;s 150 million degree milestone a critical validation of its physics approach. The company is already constructing Orion, its 50-megawatt commercial power plant, 130 miles from the Polaris facility near Microsoft&#39;s expanding data center campus in Malaga, Washington. Helion&#39;s unique approach targets deuterium-helium-3 fusion rather than the deuterium-tritium reactions most competitors pursue, producing fewer neutrons and generating electricity directly through electromagnetic induction rather than requiring steam turbines. While skeptics question whether any fusion company can achieve grid delivery within three years, Helion&#39;s progress has attracted over $2 billion in funding from investors including Sam Altman and Peter Thiel, positioning it as a frontrunner in the race to commercialize fusion energy.</p>
<h3>3. Inertia Enterprises Raises $450 Million to Commercialize Laser Fusion Technology - <em>Feb 11</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Series A funding led by Bessemer and GV supports development of grid-scale laser beamlines targeting 2030 power plant construction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inertia Enterprises announced a $450 million Series A financing round on February 11, 2026, to advance development of its laser-based inertial fusion power plant featuring Thunderwall—the world&#39;s first grid-scale fusion laser beamline. The funding round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from Alphabet&#39;s GV, Modern Capital, and Threshold Ventures, positions Inertia among the most heavily capitalized private fusion ventures pursuing commercialization of the only fusion approach proven to achieve net energy gain.</p>
<p>At the heart of Inertia&#39;s fusion power plant design is Thunderwall, delivering a 10 kilojoule beam 10 times per second with 10% wall-plug efficiency. Each commercial power plant will require approximately 1,000 lasers bombarding 4.5-millimeter targets that cost less than $1 each to mass produce through automated fabrication systems. This approach builds directly on the breakthrough achieved by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&#39;s National Ignition Facility, which in December 2022 became the first controlled fusion experiment to achieve net target energy gain by focusing 192 laser beams onto a frozen deuterium-tritium pellet smaller than a peppercorn, generating 3.15 megajoules of fusion energy from 2.05 megajoules of laser energy.</p>
<p>Inertia&#39;s challenge is scaling this laboratory demonstration into a commercial power plant capable of firing laser pulses rapidly and reliably while achieving even higher energy gains. The company was co-founded by Jeff Lawson (who co-founded Twilio), Dr. Annie Kritcher (who led fusion experiments at NIF and whose design enabled the first net energy gain), and Prof. Mike Dunne from Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The team brings together expertise in high-repetition-rate laser systems, automated target fabrication, and fusion physics to address the technical hurdles separating NIF&#39;s few-shots-per-day research operation from a power plant requiring multiple shots per second for continuous electricity generation. Inertia intends to start construction on its first grid-scale power plant in 2030, competing with magnetic fusion approaches in the race to deliver commercial fusion energy.</p>
<h3>4. Commonwealth Fusion Systems Installs First SPARC Magnet, Partners with Nvidia on Digital Twin - <em>Jan/Feb 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>High-temperature superconducting magnet positioned in tokamak assembly as AI-driven digital twin accelerates development toward 2027 first plasma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems announced in January 2026 that it had installed the first of eighteen high-temperature superconducting toroidal field magnets into SPARC&#39;s main assembly structure at its Devens, Massachusetts facility, marking critical progress toward the demonstration tokamak expected to produce first plasma in 2026 and achieve net fusion energy in 2027. The installation milestone was announced alongside a strategic partnership with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a comprehensive digital twin of the fusion reactor.</p>
<p>The newly installed D-shaped magnet is the first of 18 that will form a doughnut-like structure to confine and compress plasma, with each magnet weighing approximately 24 tons and generating a 20-tesla magnetic field—roughly 13 times stronger than a standard MRI machine. SPARC&#39;s magnets use yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) high-temperature superconducting tape capable of generating magnetic fields exceeding 20 Tesla, approximately twice the field strength achievable with conventional low-temperature superconductors. This dramatically stronger magnetic field allows SPARC to confine fusion-grade plasma in a device with only 1/65th the volume of ITER while targeting a fusion gain of approximately 11, meaning it will produce eleven times more fusion energy than the heating power supplied to the plasma.</p>
<p>The digital twin developed in collaboration with Nvidia and Siemens, unveiled at CES 2026, represents a significant advancement in fusion technology development through artificial intelligence. The virtual replica of SPARC allows researchers to simulate plasma behavior, test control strategies, and optimize operating parameters without requiring physical experiments on the actual reactor. The company expects to complete the full ring of magnets by the end of summer 2026, positioning SPARC to achieve first plasma before year-end. If SPARC succeeds in demonstrating net fusion energy, it will validate the physics and engineering for ARC, CFS&#39;s planned 400-megawatt commercial fusion power plant targeted for grid delivery in the early 2030s, potentially making CFS the first company to deliver commercial fusion electricity.</p>
<h3>5. Princeton Researchers Solve Plasma Rotation Mystery Critical for Reactor Longevity - <em>Feb 17</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>New simulations show toroidal rotation determines exhaust particle distribution, enabling engineers to design divertors that can handle decades of heat loads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory published findings in Physical Review Letters on February 17, 2026, demonstrating that toroidal rotation—the motion of plasma particles as they move around the tokamak—plays a key role in determining exactly where plasma fuel lands in the machine&#39;s exhaust system. The discovery solves a long-standing mystery about asymmetric heat loads on divertor components and provides critical data for designing future fusion reactors capable of surviving decades of continuous operation.</p>
<p>The research team, led by associate research physicist Eric Emdee, used the modeling code SOLPS-ITER to simulate particle paths under different conditions in the DIII-D tokamak in California. The team tested four scenarios: with and without cross-field drifts and with and without plasma rotation. Simulations couldn&#39;t match experimental observations until researchers added one crucial ingredient: the measured core rotation of 88.4 kilometers per second. When plasma core rotation was combined with cross-field drifts, simulations finally matched experimental measurements, revealing that the rotating plasma core significantly influences edge flows and exhaust particle distribution.</p>
<p>Understanding what drives asymmetric exhaust distribution matters critically for designing future fusion systems because engineers need to know precisely where exhaust particles will land to build divertors capable of handling the extreme heat without degrading. Divertors must survive neutron bombardment, plasma interactions, and temperatures exceeding those on the Sun&#39;s surface while maintaining structural integrity for the reactor&#39;s operational lifetime—potentially decades of continuous service. The Princeton findings suggest that accurately predicting exhaust behavior in future fusion systems will require accounting for how the rotating plasma core influences edge flows, a connection previously underappreciated in reactor design calculations. This improved understanding allows engineers to design divertors with appropriate materials, cooling systems, and geometries positioned where heat loads will actually occur, rather than relying on simplified models that failed to capture rotation effects. The research collaboration included scientists from MIT, North Carolina State University, and multiple plasma physics laboratories, demonstrating the international scientific cooperation driving fusion energy toward commercialization.</p>

<h2>Human Genetics &amp; Gene Science</h2>
<h3>1. Precision BioSciences Receives FDA Clearance for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Gene Editing Trial - <em>Feb 18</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Study May Proceed notification enables PBGENE-DMD gene excision therapy to advance toward first patient dosing targeting 60% of DMD mutations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Precision BioSciences announced on February 18, 2026, that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a Study May Proceed notification for PBGENE-DMD, the company&#39;s investigational in vivo gene-editing therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The clearance enables the FUNCTION-DMD Phase 1/2 clinical trial to proceed with first patient dosing expected in late Q1 or early Q2 2026, with initial data from multiple patients anticipated by year-end 2026.</p>
<p>PBGENE-DMD represents a novel first-in-class gene editing therapy utilizing a gene excision approach clearly differentiated from existing microdystrophin and exon skipping treatments. The therapy is designed to potentially provide durable functional muscle improvement for DMD patients with mutations in exons 45-55, a hotspot affecting approximately 60% of boys with DMD. The treatment uses a single adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding two ARCUS proteins—Precision&#39;s proprietary gene editing nucleases—designed to permanently edit a patient&#39;s DNA within the dystrophin gene, resulting in naturally-expressed, near full-length, functional dystrophin protein production.</p>
<p>New preclinical study data supporting PBGENE-DMD&#39;s potential safety and long-term efficacy was selected as a poster presentation at the 2026 Muscular Dystrophy Association Clinical &amp; Scientific Conference in Orlando, Florida. The gene excision strategy permanently removes the mutated exon regions, allowing cells to produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein—unlike enzyme replacement or antisense oligonucleotide approaches requiring continuous administration. Early efficacy will be assessed by measuring the percentage of near full-length dystrophin protein expression from muscle biopsies, a direct biomarker of therapeutic effect. If successful, PBGENE-DMD could provide a one-time treatment addressing the genetic cause of Duchenne rather than managing symptoms, potentially transforming outcomes for thousands of boys currently facing progressive muscle degeneration and premature death from this devastating disease.</p>
<h3>2. Scribe Therapeutics and Eli Lilly Achieve Second CRISPR Development Milestone for Neurological Disorders - <em>Feb 17</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Advancement in X-Editor technology collaboration demonstrates progress toward in vivo gene editing therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scribe Therapeutics announced on February 17, 2026, the achievement of a second success milestone for one of the targets in its collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company focused on developing in vivo CRISPR-based genetic medicines for neurological and neuromuscular disorders. The milestone reflects continued momentum in applying Scribe&#39;s proprietary X-Editor (XE) technology platform to therapeutic programs targeting some of medicine&#39;s most challenging diseases.</p>
<p>The milestone achievement demonstrates technical advancement tied to one of the specific targets under the companies&#39; 2023 research agreement, which established a broad collaboration to develop gene editing therapies. Under the terms of the original agreement, Scribe is eligible to receive more than $1.5 billion in total milestone payments across research, development, regulatory, and commercial achievements, in addition to royalties on product sales. The companies previously signaled progress through an initial milestone achievement and joint scientific presentation at the American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy annual meeting in 2025.</p>
<p>Scribe&#39;s X-Editor technology represents next-generation CRISPR systems engineered for enhanced specificity, reduced off-target editing, and optimized delivery to target tissues—critical requirements for safe and effective in vivo gene editing. CEO Benjamin Oakes stated that &quot;advancing this program with Lilly reinforces our conviction that purpose-built CRISPR technologies can clear the potency and specificity thresholds required for transformative therapies in neurological and neuromuscular diseases.&quot; Neurological disorders present unique challenges for gene therapy because treatments must cross the blood-brain barrier, edit sufficient numbers of neurons to produce clinical benefit, and avoid triggering immune responses in the central nervous system. The collaboration&#39;s progress suggests these technical hurdles are being systematically addressed, bringing one-time curative genetic medicines for previously untreatable neurological conditions closer to clinical reality.</p>
<h3>3. Cellares and University of Wisconsin Advance CRISPR-Edited CAR-T Therapy for Brain Tumors Toward Clinical Manufacturing - <em>Feb 18</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Partnership expansion supports regulatory preparation and automated manufacturing of GD2-targeted therapy for high-grade gliomas and other solid tumors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cellares and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health announced on February 18, 2026, an expansion of their partnership to support clinical production and regulatory advancement of UW&#39;s CRISPR-edited GD2 CAR-T investigational therapy for pediatric and adult solid tumors, initially targeting high-grade gliomas. The collaboration will leverage Cellares&#39; automated Cell Shuttle and Cell Q platforms to manufacture the complex CRISPR-edited cell therapy while preparing regulatory submissions for FDA review.</p>
<p>The GD2 CAR-T program targets solid tumors in pediatric and adult patients and could inform future studies in neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and melanoma—all GD2-positive cancers with limited therapeutic options in the refractory or relapsed setting. GD2 is a ganglioside surface antigen highly expressed on certain aggressive cancers, making it an attractive CAR-T target. However, engineering effective CAR-T therapies for solid tumors has proven far more challenging than for blood cancers due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, physical barriers preventing T cell infiltration, and lack of tumor-specific antigens.</p>
<p>The program uses CRISPR gene editing to modify patient T cells via electroporation, precisely disrupting genes that would otherwise limit CAR-T cell persistence, function, or safety. This approach requires reproducible manufacturing to ensure each batch meets stringent specifications—a challenge addressed through Cellares&#39; fully automated platforms. Cellares will provide manufacturing support using its Cell Shuttle end-to-end automated platform and Cell Q automated quality control platform, and will provide regulatory expertise to support preparation and submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, including contributions to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section. The collaboration builds on an initial partnership announced in April 2025 focused on automating UW&#39;s internally developed CAR-T process. If successful, the CRISPR-edited GD2 CAR-T therapy could represent a breakthrough in treating brain cancers and other solid tumors that have largely resisted the CAR-T revolution that transformed blood cancer treatment.</p>
<h3>4. AI-Designed CRISPR Editor OpenCRISPR-1 Achieves High Precision with Reduced Off-Target Effects - <em>Early 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>First gene-editing enzyme entirely created with large language models shows improved efficiency and safety compared to natural CRISPR systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The genome-editing field entered a new era in early 2026 with the public release of OpenCRISPR-1, the first gene-editing enzyme entirely created using large language models trained on extensive natural CRISPR-Cas data. The AI-designed editor represents a novel, synthetic system distinct from any known natural CRISPR mechanism, demonstrating that machine learning can now design biological tools from first principles rather than merely optimizing natural systems.</p>
<p>OpenCRISPR-1 was developed by training large language models on massive datasets encompassing natural CRISPR-Cas systems, protein structures, and gene editing outcomes. The AI identified patterns in successful editing enzymes and designed a synthetic nuclease optimized for human therapeutic applications. Early reports indicate OpenCRISPR-1 achieves high editing efficiency in human cells while substantially reducing off-target activity and immunogenicity compared to natural CRISPR systems—addressing two critical barriers to safe clinical gene editing.</p>
<p>Off-target editing, where CRISPR enzymes cut DNA at unintended locations similar to the target sequence, poses safety risks including chromosomal rearrangements and disruption of tumor suppressor genes. Immunogenicity, the tendency of bacterial CRISPR proteins to trigger immune responses when introduced into human cells, can reduce therapeutic efficacy and cause adverse reactions. By designing a synthetic editor free from evolutionary constraints that shaped natural CRISPR systems, OpenCRISPR-1 potentially overcomes limitations inherent in repurposing bacterial immune proteins for human therapeutics. The development demonstrates convergence between AI and biotechnology, where machine learning accelerates discovery and optimization of biological tools. Multiple biotechnology companies are evaluating OpenCRISPR-1 for therapeutic applications in genetic diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, potentially expanding the range of conditions amenable to safe, precise gene editing.</p>
<h3>5. CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Targeting ANGPTL3 Shows Sustained Lipid Reduction in Phase 1 Trial - <em>Feb 2026</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Single intravenous infusion produces dose-dependent reductions up to 50% for LDL cholesterol and 55% for triglycerides in patients with elevated lipids despite standard therapies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Results from a phase 1, first-in-human trial of a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing therapy targeting ANGPTL3 were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions and published in The New England Journal of Medicine in late 2025, with continued analysis and discussion through February 2026. The therapy produced sustained, dose-dependent reductions of up to nearly 50% for LDL cholesterol and nearly 55% for triglycerides in patients with elevated lipids despite maximal standard therapies, demonstrating proof-of-concept for &quot;one-and-done&quot; CRISPR-based lipid lowering.</p>
<p>ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like protein 3) is a liver-secreted protein that regulates lipid metabolism by inhibiting enzymes that break down triglycerides and lipoproteins. Humans with natural loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL3 exhibit dramatically reduced LDL cholesterol and triglycerides without apparent adverse effects, suggesting the protein is a safe therapeutic target. The CRISPR therapy, administered as a single intravenous infusion, uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver gene editing components specifically to liver cells, where they permanently disrupt the ANGPTL3 gene, reducing protein production.</p>
<p>The Phase 1 trial enrolled patients with mixed dyslipidemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, or severe hypertriglyceridemia who remained at high cardiovascular risk despite statin therapy and other lipid-lowering medications. Patients received single infusions at varying doses and were monitored for safety, immune responses, and lipid levels. Results showed dose-dependent, durable lipid reductions persisting throughout the follow-up period without evidence of editing-related adverse events or significant off-target effects detected in comprehensive genomic analyses. The promise of one-and-done CRISPR-based lipid lowering represents a paradigm shift from daily medications to a single treatment potentially providing lifelong cardiovascular protection. If larger trials confirm safety and efficacy, in vivo CRISPR therapies could transform prevention of heart disease—the leading cause of death globally—extending gene editing&#39;s impact beyond rare genetic diseases to common conditions affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide.</p>

The model leads all other frontier systems on Humanity&#39;s Last Exam, a complex multidisciplinary reasoning test, and on GDPval-AA—which evaluates performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks—Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI&#39;s latest models by approximately 144 Elo points. The model scored 91% on GPQA (Graduate-Level Science Q&amp;A) and 53% on High-Level Expertise Reasoning, demonstrating capabilities at the frontier of human expertise.</p>
<p>The million-token context window represents a fivefold expansion from the previous 200,000-token limit, enabling the model to process approximately 750,000 words of input—roughly equivalent to eight full-length novels or extensive codebases—while maintaining coherent reasoning across that entire context. This capability unlocks applications previously infeasible, including legal document analysis spanning hundreds of contracts, medical literature synthesis across thousands of research papers, and software development projects requiring understanding of complete application architectures. On MRCR v2, which tests finding and reasoning over specific facts buried in massive prompts, Opus 4.6 scores 76% compared to Sonnet 4.5&#39;s 18.5%, demonstrating dramatically improved ability to locate and synthesize information from extensive contexts. Anthropic&#39;s achievement intensifies competition across the frontier model landscape, with the month of February 2026 seeing unprecedented releases from Google, OpenAI, Chinese labs, and other competitors, signaling that AI competition has entered a phase where absolute performance gaps between leading models are narrowing and differentiation increasingly depends on specialized capabilities, pricing, and ecosystem integration.</p>
<h3>3. ByteDance&#39;s Seedance 2.0 Draws Hollywood Backlash Over Copyright as Video Generation Quality Soars - <em>Feb 12-20</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>AI video model generates photorealistic 15-second clips from text prompts, triggering cease-and-desist letters from Disney and Paramount over training data concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ByteDance officially unveiled Seedance 2.0 on February 12, 2026, an image-to-video and text-to-video generation model that rapidly became the most talked-about AI tool on the internet within 72 hours of release. The model features unprecedented photorealism, character consistency, and ease of use, generating 15-second video clips from simple text prompts—but quickly drew legal threats from major Hollywood studios alleging the model was trained on copyrighted content without authorization or compensation.</p>
<p>Seedance 2.0 enables users to create videos by entering text prompts, with capabilities including multimodal reference input supporting up to 12 files, extreme character consistency across scenes, video editing and extension features, audio-visual beat matching, and 2K output resolution with 30% faster generation than previous versions. The model produces results similar to OpenAI&#39;s Sora, but with broader availability—currently accessible to Chinese users of ByteDance&#39;s Jianying app, with global rollout planned for the CapCut app. Shortly after release, realistic clips based on real actors, TV shows, and films went viral, including reimagined Friends characters as otters, fabricated fights between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, and surreal scenarios involving major entertainment properties.</p>
<p>On February 13, 2026, The Walt Disney Company sent ByteDance a cease-and-desist letter alleging the model had been trained with Disney works without compensation. Paramount Skydance similarly accused the company of &quot;blatant infringement&quot; of intellectual property including Star Trek, South Park, and Dora the Explorer. The controversy intensified on February 20 when CNN reported that Seedance 2.0&#39;s quality had &quot;spooked Hollywood,&quot; raising existential questions about whether AI video generation threatens the entertainment industry&#39;s business model. The incident highlights the collision between rapid AI advancement and intellectual property law, with generative AI companies arguing that training on copyrighted works constitutes fair use for learning purposes while content creators demand compensation and control over how their work is used. As AI video generation quality approaches professional standards, the legal and regulatory frameworks governing these technologies remain unresolved, with courts, legislatures, and international bodies struggling to balance innovation incentives against creator rights in an era where AI can replicate and remix creative works at scale.</p>
<h3>4. UK and Microsoft Partner on World-First Deepfake Detection Evaluation Framework - <em>Feb 6</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Government-funded deepfake detection challenge draws 350 participants including INTERPOL and Five Eyes as 8 million deepfakes shared in 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.K. government announced on February 6, 2026, a collaboration with Microsoft and other technology companies to develop a &quot;world-first deepfake detection evaluation framework&quot; designed to identify gaps in synthetic media detection and strengthen defenses against harmful AI-generated content. The framework will standardize assessment of deepfake detection tools and support law enforcement by evaluating effectiveness against critical threats including fraud, impersonation, and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>More than 350 participants—including INTERPOL, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and major technology companies—took part in a government-funded deepfake detection challenge hosted by Microsoft. The government estimated that 8 million deepfakes were shared in 2025, up from 500,000 in 2023, highlighting the exponential growth of synthetic media and the urgency behind detection initiatives. The framework is designed to support law enforcement by standardizing how detection technologies are assessed against the most critical threats, enabling agencies to select and deploy tools with confidence in their capabilities.</p>
<p>The partnership addresses growing concerns that deepfake technology has advanced to the point where synthetic content is virtually indistinguishable from authentic media for most viewers. Deepfakes have been weaponized for financial fraud through CEO impersonation scams, political disinformation including fabricated statements by government officials, revenge pornography and non-consensual intimate imagery, and celebrity impersonation for fraudulent endorsements. Traditional detection methods based on visual artifacts are increasingly failing as generative models produce higher-fidelity outputs, driving need for more sophisticated detection approaches potentially leveraging AI itself to identify synthetic patterns invisible to humans. The U.K.-Microsoft framework represents recognition that deepfake proliferation requires coordinated international response combining technical standards, law enforcement capacity building, and public-private collaboration. The initiative follows rising threats across democratic societies where synthetic media undermines trust in information sources and enables new forms of fraud and harassment at unprecedented scale.</p>
<h3>5. AI Discovers Rare-Earth-Free Magnetic Materials 200 Times Faster Than Traditional Methods - <em>Feb 18</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-science/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>University of New Hampshire researchers build database of 67,573 magnetic compounds including 25 newly identified high-temperature materials, reducing EV magnet dependence on China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists at the University of New Hampshire published research in Nature Communications on February 18, 2026, demonstrating that artificial intelligence dramatically accelerated the hunt for next-generation magnetic materials, building a massive searchable database of 67,573 magnetic compounds including 25 newly recognized materials that retain magnetism even at high temperatures. The breakthrough could reduce global dependence on expensive rare-earth elements dominated by Chinese supply chains and accelerate development of more sustainable electric vehicles and clean energy technologies.</p>
<p>The UNH team built the &quot;Northeast Materials Database&quot; by developing an artificial intelligence system capable of reading scientific papers and extracting key experimental details including chemical compositions, synthesis methods, and magnetic properties. This data fed computer models that predicted whether materials are magnetic and identified maximum operating temperatures before materials lose magnetism, then organized findings into a single, searchable database. The AI-driven approach achieved material discovery approximately 200 times faster than traditional laboratory experimentation, which requires synthesizing each candidate material, characterizing its properties, and testing performance under various conditions.</p>
<p>The research identified 25 entirely new materials maintaining magnetic properties at high temperatures—critical for electric vehicle motors, wind turbine generators, and industrial applications where magnets must function reliably at elevated operating temperatures. Today&#39;s most powerful permanent magnets depend on rare earth elements including neodymium, dysprosium, and samarium, which are costly, largely imported from China, and increasingly difficult to secure amid geopolitical tensions. The new materials use earth-abundant elements potentially available from diverse global sources, reducing supply chain vulnerabilities while lowering costs. The breakthrough demonstrates AI&#39;s transformative potential in materials discovery, where the space of possible chemical combinations is so vast that systematic experimental exploration is impractical. By learning patterns from existing scientific literature, AI can predict promising candidates for synthesis and testing, dramatically accelerating the innovation cycle. Multiple companies are now evaluating the AI-discovered materials for commercial applications, with prototypes expected within 2-3 years if scaled manufacturing proves feasible, potentially transforming clean energy technology supply chains away from rare earth dependence toward abundant alternative materials.</p>

<h1>Weekly Finance Briefing</h1>
<p><strong>Week of February 8 - 15, 2026</strong></p>
<p><em>Research Generated: February 15, 2026, 08:00 AM PST</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Inflation &amp; Finance Metrics</h2>
<h3>1. January CPI Inflation Falls to 2.4%, Lowest Level Since May, as Energy Prices Drop - <em>Feb 13</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The Consumer Price Index increased just 2.4% year-over-year in January 2026, down from 2.7% in December, driven by a 0.1% decline in energy prices as gasoline fell 7.5%, while core inflation eased to 2.5%, the lowest since April 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The annual inflation rate in the United States slowed to 2.4% in January 2026, marking the lowest level since May and providing relief for consumers and policymakers as price pressures continued to moderate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on February 13, 2026 that the Consumer Price Index increased just 0.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis in January, with energy prices falling 1.5% and gasoline prices plunging 7.5% compared to a 3.4% decline in December. The shelter index, which has been the primary driver of inflation persistence, rose a modest 0.2% in January and was the largest factor in the monthly increase.</p>
<p>Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy components, eased to 2.5% year-over-year, down from 2.6% in December and marking the lowest reading since April 2021. The food index increased 0.2% over the month, matching the food at home index increase, while the food away from home index rose just 0.1%, suggesting restaurant price pressures are moderating. The cooler-than-expected inflation data immediately boosted expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2026, with futures markets pricing in increased probability of monetary easing by mid-year.</p>
<p>However, inflation concerns persist as businesses prepare to pass tariff costs to consumers in coming months. Fed Chair Powell noted that he expects a one-time increase in consumer prices to work its way through the economy by the middle of 2026, with tariff-driven inflation expected to top out in the middle quarters of the year. Goldman Sachs anticipates inflation will increase by three-tenths of a percentage point in just the first six months of 2026, while JPMorgan projects that businesses could shift tariff absorption from 80% in 2025 to just 20% in 2026, dramatically increasing consumer price impacts.</p>
<h3>2. Retail Sales Stagnate at 0.0% in December as Consumer Confidence Plunges to Decade Low - <em>Feb 10</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>December 2025 retail sales were completely flat at 0.0%, significantly underperforming expectations of 0.4%, while core retail sales fell 0.1%, as consumer confidence plummeted from 94.2 to 84.5 in January 2026, the lowest level in over a decade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>American consumer spending showed alarming weakness in December 2025, with retail sales completely flat at 0.0% according to Commerce Department data released February 10, 2026, significantly underperforming economist expectations of 0.4% growth. Core retail sales, which exclude volatile categories like autos and gasoline, fell 0.1% in December, well below the 0.4% advance economists had predicted, signaling a broad-based slowdown in consumer discretionary spending as Americans grow increasingly cautious about economic conditions.</p>
<p>The retail sales stagnation reflects a dramatic deterioration in consumer confidence, with the Conference Board&#39;s sentiment index plummeting from 94.2 in December to 84.5 in January 2026, marking the lowest level in over a decade. Consumers cited a &quot;triple threat&quot; of high tariffs expected to raise prices, persistent inflation eroding purchasing power, and a softening labor market creating job insecurity. The wage growth slowdown compounds these concerns, with the Employment Cost Index rising only 0.7% during the last three months of 2025, the weakest pace in more than four years.</p>
<p>Consumer spending divergence by income bracket intensified throughout 2025, creating a pronounced K-shaped economy where higher-income households maintain spending while middle- and lower-income Americans pull back sharply. Retailers focused on value and low prices like Walmart and TJX have significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500, while discretionary-heavy stores like Target struggle with declining traffic and margin compression. Executives during Q4 earnings calls offered conservative guidance for 2026, warning of aggressive promotional activity throughout the first quarter as companies clear excess inventory, which threatens to erode profit margins across the retail sector.</p>
<h3>3. Tariffs Reach Highest Levels Since 1946 as Weighted Average Rate Hits 13.5% - <em>Feb 6</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. tariffs reached their highest levels since 1946 as of February 6, 2026, with the weighted average applied tariff rate on all imports rising to 13.5% and an effective tariff rate of 9.9%, representing the largest tax increase as a percent of GDP (0.54%) since 1993.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump administration tariffs have reached historic levels, with the weighted average applied tariff rate on all imports surging to 13.5% as of February 6, 2026, the highest since 1946, while the average effective tariff rate reached 9.9%, according to analysis from the Yale Budget Lab and Tax Foundation. The tariff increases represent the largest U.S. tax increase as a percentage of GDP (0.54 percent for 2026) since 1993, imposing substantial costs on American businesses and consumers as the economy faces multiple headwinds.</p>
<p>The inflation outlook for 2026 reflects growing concerns about tariff pass-through to consumers, with businesses beginning to shift cost burden after absorbing the majority of tariff impacts in 2025. JPMorgan estimates that businesses absorbed roughly 80% of the tariff bill in 2025, but that percentage could shrink to just 20% in 2026 as companies exhaust their ability to compress margins and must raise prices to maintain profitability. Research from the Budget Lab shows that over the June-August 2025 period, tariffs explained roughly 0.5 percentage points of headline PCE annualized inflation and around 0.4 percentage points of core PCE annualized inflation.</p>
<p>Economic growth projections have been revised downward, with estimates suggesting the imposed tariffs will reduce U.S. GDP by 0.5 percent before accounting for foreign retaliation. Looking specifically at calendar year 2026, accounting for all 2025 U.S. tariffs and retaliation implemented to date, real GDP growth is estimated to be 0.1 percentage points lower. Consumer prices for specific goods face substantial increases, with durables prices expected to rise a cumulative 4.5% over 2025-27, nondurables to rise 5.6%, and motor vehicle prices projected to increase by 8.4% under all tariff actions—the equivalent of an additional $4,000 to the price of an average 2024 new car.</p>
<h3>4. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.09% as Housing Market Shows Signs of Rebound - <em>Feb 12</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage slipped to 6.09% in the week ending February 12, down from 6.11% the previous week, as the housing market shows signs of rebalance with monthly payments expected to decline for the first time since 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mortgage rates edged lower in mid-February 2026, with the average for 30-year fixed loans falling to 6.09%, down from 6.11% the previous week according to Freddie Mac data released February 12, providing marginal relief to prospective homebuyers after rates peaked near 7% a year ago. The modest decline reflects cooling inflation data and Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, though rates remain largely unchanged from early February levels as persistently higher-than-desired inflation continues to be offset by a slowly weakening yet still resilient labor market.</p>
<p>Despite the modest improvement in rates, housing demand has remained sluggish even as borrowing costs dropped from nearly 7% a year ago, reflecting fundamental affordability challenges that persist across most major markets. However, the housing market is showing signs of a rebalance and potential rebound in 2026, with monthly payments expected to decline for the first time since 2020 as mortgage rates trend lower and home price growth moderates to approximately 2% for the full year. Affordability is improving because those monthly payments are shrinking and incomes are also expected to grow, providing incremental relief to buyers locked out during the 2021-2023 price surge.</p>
<p>Major financial institutions project that mortgage rates are expected to remain largely unchanged throughout February, with the full-year 2026 outlook suggesting rates will stay rangebound between approximately 5.75% and 6.5% depending on inflation trends and Federal Reserve policy decisions. The rate environment creates a complex dynamic where potential sellers remain &quot;locked in&quot; to sub-4% mortgages obtained during the pandemic era, constraining inventory and limiting home sales volume even as prices stabilize and affordability marginally improves for those able to navigate the high-rate environment.</p>
<h3>5. Jobless Claims Fall to 227,000 as Labor Market Stabilizes Despite Weak Job Growth - <em>Feb 12</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Initial jobless claims decreased to 227,000 in the week ending February 7, down 5,000 from the previous week, while continuing claims rose to 1.862 million, reflecting a low-firing, low-hiring labor market that added just 130,000 jobs in January.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The labor market showed signs of stabilization in early February 2026, with initial jobless claims falling to 227,000 in the week ending February 7, a decrease of 5,000 from the previous week&#39;s revised level, though slightly above the Dow Jones estimate of 225,000. The modest decline in new claims suggests employers are not engaging in mass layoffs despite economic uncertainty and tariff headwinds, maintaining a low-firing environment even as hiring has slowed substantially from 2021-2022 peak levels.</p>
<p>However, continuing claims—the number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid—increased 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.862 million during the week ended January 31, suggesting unemployed workers are taking longer to find new positions. The rise in continuing claims was partially attributed to business disruptions following a series of winter storms across multiple parts of the country, though the underlying trend points to reduced labor market dynamism with fewer job openings and longer unemployment durations.</p>
<p>The January employment situation report revealed a labor market that is stabilizing but far weaker beneath the surface than headline figures suggest. Employers added a healthy 130,000 jobs in January with the unemployment rate falling to 4.3%, but revisions showed job growth averaged only about 15,000 per month throughout 2025 after adjustments. Service sectors like finance and professional services that normally power the creation of high-paying office positions have been shedding jobs, perhaps reflecting employers&#39; anticipation of AI-related cost savings and productivity enhancements that reduce headcount requirements while maintaining or increasing output.</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Developments</h2>
<h3>1. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Record Continued Outflows as Institutional Momentum Pauses - <em>Feb 4</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $272 million in net outflows on February 3 as Bitcoin fluctuated between $73,000 and $76,000, while Ethereum ETFs posted $14 million in inflows, signaling the first weekly period without net inflows since mid-January.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds experienced approximately $272 million in net outflows on February 3, 2026, even as Bitcoin&#39;s price swung sharply between roughly $73,000 and $76,000, according to data compiled by industry trackers. Fidelity Investments&#39; FBTC led the exodus with $148.7 million in outflows, followed by Ark Invest&#39;s ARKB with $62.5 million in redemptions and a combined $90.4 million from Grayscale Investments&#39; Bitcoin funds. BlackRock&#39;s IBIT was the only major fund to see inflows on the day, adding about $60 million, demonstrating the bifurcated nature of institutional sentiment.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have not recorded a weekly net inflow since mid-January 2026, marking a notable pause in institutional momentum after the explosive growth of 2025 when Bitcoin ETF inflows totaled $23 billion. Bitcoin ETF assets have fallen sharply from near $115 billion to approximately $83 billion, while Ethereum ETFs have seen an even steeper contraction, dropping from around $18 billion to $11 billion. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields has been identified as a central factor in the capital outflow, as the risk-free rate approaches levels that make fixed income more competitive with volatile crypto assets.</p>
<p>However, capital rotation rather than wholesale exit from crypto appears to be the dominant dynamic. While Bitcoin faced outflows on February 3, spot ether ETFs posted net inflows of about $14 million on the same day, while XRP-focused products attracted nearly $20 million, suggesting some investors are rotating exposure rather than exiting crypto markets outright. The divergence points to selective positioning as investors reassess relative value across crypto assets amid evolving regulatory frameworks, with newly approved altcoin ETFs capturing flows that previously would have concentrated exclusively in Bitcoin products.</p>
<h3>2. Stablecoin Regulation Intensifies as New York Prosecutors Challenge GENIUS Act Framework - <em>Feb 3</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan&#39;s Alvin Bragg, alleged the GENIUS Act fails to provide comprehensive anti-fraud measures and criticized Circle and Tether for profiting $1 billion each from frozen funds in 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stablecoin regulatory landscape intensified in early February 2026 as New York&#39;s top prosecutors mounted a significant challenge to the federal GENIUS Act framework, alleging that the landmark stablecoin law fails to provide comprehensive anti-fraud measures and creates legal cover for issuers to profit from stolen funds. Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan&#39;s Alvin Bragg, specifically targeted both Circle and Tether, estimating that each company made $1 billion in profits during 2024 from investing reserve funds backing stolen and frozen stablecoins, with Circle holding more than $114 million in frozen funds as of November.</p>
<p>The prosecutors take issue with what the GENIUS Act lacks—namely, language that would compel companies to return stolen funds to victims of fraud rather than allowing issuers to keep and invest those assets indefinitely. Under current GENIUS Act provisions, supervisory agencies must publish implementing rules for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issuers by July 18, 2026, with regulations taking effect six months later by January 18, 2027 at the latest. The implementation process has already become contentious, with banks demanding that regulators close a &quot;loophole&quot; that allows stablecoin issuers to offer yield, a feature banks fear will undermine their deposit base and competitive positioning.</p>
<p>Amid the regulatory controversy, Tether launched USAT, a dollar-backed token issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, representing Tether&#39;s first product specifically designed to operate within the U.S. federal stablecoin framework established under the GENIUS Act. The move signals Tether&#39;s attempt to address long-standing regulatory criticism and capture institutional capital that has increasingly favored Circle&#39;s USDC due to compliance and transparency concerns. The regulatory battle over frozen funds, yield restrictions, and fraud remediation will likely shape the final implementing regulations due in July, with significant implications for the competitive dynamics of the $308 billion stablecoin market.</p>
<h3>3. ETHDenver 2026 Draws SEC Officials as Regulatory Engagement Marks Shift from Enforcement to Collaboration - <em>Feb 17-21</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>ETHDenver 2026 runs February 17-21 with expected attendance of 18,000+, featuring SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and White House officials, reflecting a broader shift in how regulators view the Ethereum ecosystem after years of adversarial enforcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ETHDenver 2026, the world&#39;s largest Ethereum-focused conference and hackathon, takes place February 17-21 at Denver&#39;s Stockyards Event Center with expected attendance exceeding 18,000 developers, investors, and policymakers. The event marks a watershed moment in crypto-government relations, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, White House representatives, and other federal officials scheduled to attend, reflecting a fundamental shift from avoidance and adversarial enforcement to direct engagement with the Ethereum development community.</p>
<p>The regulatory presence at ETHDenver signals the impact of leadership changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission following the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and the passage of the GENIUS Act, which transitioned the United States from a regime of regulation by enforcement to purpose-built legislative frameworks providing clear compliance pathways. SEC Chair Atkins has announced plans for a &quot;token taxonomy&quot; to delineate which cryptocurrencies would be classified as securities, embarked on &quot;Project Crypto&quot; to update the SEC&#39;s rules around digital assets, and is pushing an &quot;innovation exemption&quot; to fast-track crypto products through the approval process.</p>
<p>The conference programming spans core Ethereum infrastructure, Layer-2 scaling solutions, DeFi protocols, stablecoins, privacy technologies, and governance mechanisms, with one of the world&#39;s largest Ethereum hackathons bringing together thousands of developers shipping real prototypes. Industry analysts expect Congress to pass bipartisan crypto market structure legislation in 2026, which will likely cement blockchain-based finance in U.S. capital markets and facilitate continued institutional investment. The shift from regulatory hostility to constructive engagement at events like ETHDenver represents a dramatic reversal that could unlock substantial innovation and capital formation across the blockchain sector.</p>
<h3>4. Grayscale Files for Spot AAVE ETF as Altcoin ETF Pipeline Expands Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum - <em>Feb 11</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Grayscale Investments submitted an S-1 filing to launch a spot AAVE ETF, joining a pipeline of more than 92 crypto ETFs awaiting SEC approval, with Galaxy Research projecting more than 100 altcoin, multi-asset, and leveraged crypto ETFs launching in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grayscale Investments submitted an S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot AAVE ETF, marking a major step toward bringing decentralized finance protocols into traditional markets and signaling that the ETF race is expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The filing represents the first attempt to create a U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking a DeFi governance token, potentially giving retail investors easier access to decentralized finance through standard brokerage accounts without the complexity of wallet management, private keys, and blockchain transactions.</p>
<p>The Grayscale AAVE filing is part of a massive expansion of the crypto ETF landscape, with approximately 92 crypto ETFs now awaiting SEC approval according to industry trackers. Galaxy Research projects more than 100 spot altcoin, multi-asset, and leveraged crypto ETFs launching in 2026, with net inflows projected to exceed $50 billion—more than doubling 2025 inflows. The SEC has already approved the listing and trading of several multi-asset products, including the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which combines Bitcoin and Ethereum with allocations to Solana, Cardano, and XRP.</p>
<p>XRP ETFs have emerged as early success stories among altcoin products, attracting $1.37 billion in assets under management in under 60 days with 43 consecutive days of positive inflows following Ripple&#39;s improved legal outlook. Bitwise has filed for 11 crypto strategy ETFs covering tokens including AAVE, UNI, and ZEC, while multiple issuers have submitted applications for Solana, Cardano, and other Layer-1 platform tokens. The rapid expansion of crypto ETF offerings reflects both regulatory clarity under the new SEC leadership and institutional demand for diversified exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, with traditional finance infrastructure increasingly accommodating blockchain assets.</p>
<h3>5. Bitcoin Trades Near $68,900 as Mining Sustainability Concerns Intensify Post-Halving - <em>Feb 14</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin closed at $68,900 on the CME on February 14, trading in the capitulation zone between $60,000 and $70,000, roughly 50% down from its peak, as the network hashrate reaches 894.5 EH/s and energy demands surge to 854,400 kWh per Bitcoin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin price action consolidated around $68,900 on February 14, 2026, trading within a range that historically aligns with the &quot;Year 2&quot; bear phase of Bitcoin&#39;s four-year halving cycle, down roughly 50% from peak levels. Earlier in the week on February 11, Bitcoin dropped 3% to $66,000, falling below the critical 200-week exponential moving average at $68,000, while Ethereum declined 3.5% to $1,950. With volatility cooling off, analysts expect price action may stay range-bound and consolidate around current levels, though a move toward the $71,000-$73,000 range looks possible if buyers step back in.</p>
<p>The conversation around Bitcoin&#39;s long-term sustainability has shifted from supply shock dynamics to mining viability concerns, as miners now rely more heavily on transaction fees to offset rising energy costs driven by global competition from AI data centers. The network hashrate surged to 894.5 EH/s, increasing the energy required to mine one Bitcoin to approximately 854,400 kWh—meaning daily Bitcoin mining now uses more electricity than the entire country of Belgium over the same 24-hour period. The April 2024 halving reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, pushing miners fully into a post-halving environment where efficiency, electricity costs, and scale determine survival.</p>
<p>The next Bitcoin halving is expected in 2028, cutting block rewards again to 1.5625 BTC, which will further compress margins and drive consolidation toward industrial-scale operations with access to cheap renewable energy. The 20 millionth Bitcoin is projected to be mined in March 2026, leaving only 1 million BTC remaining to be mined over the next century under Bitcoin&#39;s fixed supply schedule. Industry observers note that while 2026 continues the post-halving adjustment phase, the increased mining difficulty will squeeze out smaller operators, accelerating centralization trends that could raise long-term network security and decentralization concerns.</p>

<h2>Dedollarisation &amp; US Dollar Trends</h2>
<h3>1. US Dollar Index Falls to 96.88 as Dollar Posts Worst 12-Month Performance Since 2017 - <em>Feb 13</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The US Dollar Index (DXY) fell to 96.8817 on February 13, 2026, down 0.04% from the previous session and 9.21% over the past 12 months, marking the dollar&#39;s weakest year since 2017 as Fed rate cut expectations and international dynamics weigh on the currency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. dollar experienced significant weakness in early February 2026, with the Dollar Index (DXY) falling to 96.8817 on February 13, continuing a sustained decline that has seen the greenback weaken 2.27% over the past month and plunge 9.21% over the last 12 months. The 2025 calendar year marked the dollar&#39;s weakest annual performance since 2017, with a decline of 9.7% in the US Dollar Index (DXY), driven by Federal Reserve rate cuts, narrowing interest rate differentials with other major currencies, and growing concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability.</p>
<p>Multiple factors are contributing to ongoing dollar weakness in February 2026, with Fed rate expectations serving as the primary driver. Market participants anticipate gradual USD softness as U.S. interest rates are cut throughout 2026, though periods of dollar strength remain possible if inflation proves sticky or global markets turn cautious. Japanese banking group MUFG projects a decline of around 5% for the US dollar during 2026, while Dutch bank ABN AMRO expects &quot;a significant rise in EURUSD over the next two years&quot; to $1.25 by end-2026 and then to $1.30 by end-2027.</p>
<p>International dynamics have compounded dollar weakness, particularly the yen&#39;s sharp appreciation following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi&#39;s decisive election victory and fresh verbal interventions from Tokyo. Over one week in mid-February, the dollar declined more than 2% against the yen, marking one of the sharpest weekly moves in recent years. The combination of Fed easing expectations, improving economic conditions in Europe and Japan, and diminishing safe-haven demand during periods of market calm has created a challenging environment for dollar bulls, with most forecasts pointing to continued gradual depreciation through 2026 despite likely volatility and periodic rebounds.</p>
<h3>2. China&#39;s Yuan Strengthens Past 6.89 Per Dollar as Xi Pushes &quot;Powerful Currency&quot; Initiative - <em>Feb 14</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The offshore yuan strengthened past 6.89 per dollar in mid-February, extending its rally to a sixth straight session and reaching its strongest level since May 2023, as President Xi calls for the RMB to become a &quot;powerful currency&quot; with global reserve status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese yuan experienced significant appreciation in mid-February 2026, with the offshore yuan strengthening past 6.89 per dollar, extending its rally to a sixth consecutive session and reaching the strongest level since May 2023. The appreciation reflects China&#39;s strategic commitment to currency strength as a pillar of national power, with President Xi Jinping calling for the renminbi to become a &quot;powerful currency&quot; with global reserve currency status and the People&#39;s Bank of China indicating a commitment to &quot;slow and orderly&quot; appreciation as it balances export-led growth with currency internationalization goals.</p>
<p>China&#39;s foreign exchange reserves increased by $11.5 billion to $3.358 trillion in December 2025, up from $3.346 trillion in November, marking the sixth consecutive monthly rise and the highest level since November 2015. The accumulation was supported by a persistently weaker U.S. dollar and gold price appreciation, with the People&#39;s Bank of China continuing to add to its gold holdings for the fifteenth consecutive month in January 2026, reaching 74.19 million fine troy ounces valued at $369.58 billion, up from $319.45 billion a month earlier.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley projects the yuan will strengthen to 6.85 per U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2026, driven by improving economic fundamentals, capital inflow dynamics, and policy support for currency appreciation. However, Western analysts caution that Xi&#39;s yuan internationalization ambitions face substantial structural barriers, including capital controls that limit convertibility, lack of transparent rule of law, and dependence on state-directed credit allocation that reduces confidence compared to dollar and euro alternatives. The yuan&#39;s share of global foreign exchange reserves stood at just 1.93% in Q3 2025 according to IMF data, a distant fourth behind the dollar (approximately 57%), euro (roughly 20%), and yen, suggesting the path to reserve currency status remains long despite recent momentum.</p>
<h3>3. Russia and India Formalize Digital Currency Integration Plans for 2026 BRICS Summit - <em>Feb 4</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia confirmed plans to integrate its digital ruble with BRICS nations&#39; CBDCs, with the Reserve Bank of India placing &quot;interlinking of CBDCs&quot; on the formal agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit hosted in India, as 90% of Russia-India trade now settles in national currencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russia has confirmed plans to integrate its forthcoming digital ruble with the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) of fellow BRICS nations, with the initiative expected to feature prominently when India hosts the 2026 BRICS summit. The Reserve Bank of India, which has been piloting both retail and wholesale versions of the digital rupee (e₹), has advised the Indian government to place &quot;interlinking of CBDCs&quot; on the formal agenda for the summit, signaling a coordinated push among BRICS members to develop alternatives to dollar-dominated payment infrastructure.</p>
<p>Nearly 90% of direct transactions between India and Russia are now conducted in rubles and rupees, marking a milestone in economic cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi and demonstrating the viability of bilateral trade settlement outside the dollar system. The CBDC integration proposal centers on creating shared payment infrastructure that would allow member states to conduct cross-border trade settlements directly in their sovereign digital currencies, bypassing SWIFT and correspondent banking relationships that have been weaponized through sanctions.</p>
<p>However, the initiative&#39;s success depends on critical technical and governance challenges, including ensuring compatibility across different CBDC architectures, establishing governance frameworks for dispute resolution and regulatory oversight, and achieving adoption by commercial banking systems across member states with vastly different financial infrastructure sophistication levels. While Russia and India have demonstrated bilateral success with national currency settlement, scaling this model to encompass the full BRICS+ membership—which now includes diverse economies from Brazil to UAE to Egypt—presents substantially greater complexity and coordination requirements that may limit near-term implementation beyond pilot programs.</p>
<h3>4. Treasury 10-Year Yield Holds at 4.22% as Debt Tops $38 Trillion and Fiscal Pressures Mount - <em>Feb 6</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>The 10-year Treasury note yield finished at 4.22% on February 6, within the expected 3.75%-4.25% range for 2026, as U.S. debt surpassed $38 trillion and the federal government borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of fiscal year 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treasury yields remained relatively stable in early February 2026, with the 10-year note finishing at 4.22% on February 6, while the 2-year note ended at 3.50% and the 30-year note closed at 4.85%, trading within the ranges that market analysts expect to persist throughout 2026. Market forecasts anticipate Treasury yields will remain largely rangebound, with the 10-year Treasury yield fluctuating between 3.75% and 4.25% during 2026 as Federal Reserve rate cuts are offset by fiscal concerns and elevated inflation risks.</p>
<p>Fiscal and debt pressures continue mounting, with U.S. federal debt topping $38 trillion and the government having already borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October 2025. Large and rising fiscal deficits combined with increasing issuance of U.S. Treasuries—as well as debt issuance in other major economies—means that more and more buyers need to step up to help fund government spending at a time when traditional foreign buyers like China and Japan have reduced their Treasury holdings.</p>
<p>The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee met in early February to discuss the composition of Treasury notes and bonds to refund approximately $90.2 billion of privately-held notes and bonds maturing on February 15, 2026. Market analysts expect that ten-year Treasury yields may not fall much below the 3.75% level even as the Fed cuts interest rates, with risk that yields could move back up toward 4.5% at times if inflation proves stickier than anticipated or if foreign demand for U.S. debt continues to wane. The flood of corporate bond issuance driven by the AI infrastructure boom is creating additional competition for investor capital, potentially putting upward pressure on Treasury yields as companies tap debt markets to fund data center construction and semiconductor manufacturing expansion.</p>
<h3>5. Saudi Arabia Expands Yuan Oil Settlement as Petroyuan Gains Traction Despite Petrodollar Persistence - <em>Feb 11</em></h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-finance/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<blockquote>
<p>China and Saudi Arabia signed a $7 billion currency swap agreement enabling direct yuan-riyal settlement, as several countries including Russia, Iran, Venezuela, UAE, and Egypt now use the petroyuan, though analysts forecast decades-long transition from dollar dominance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China and Saudi Arabia recently signed a $7 billion currency swap agreement that allows direct settlement between the yuan (CNY) and the Saudi riyal (SAR), enabling bilateral trade to be conducted without using the U.S. dollar as an intermediary currency. The agreement marks a significant step in the gradual diversification away from exclusive dollar reliance for oil transactions, though Saudi oil exports are still settled in USD by default, preserving substantial petrodollar demand even as alternatives emerge.</p>
<p>As of January 2025, several countries are using the petroyuan for oil transactions, including Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, China, UAE, and Egypt, representing a meaningful expansion of yuan-based energy settlement beyond countries under U.S. sanctions. However, analysts have noted that yuan-based oil trade faces significant hurdles, with few outlets to spend accumulated RMB reserves and limited depth in yuan-denominated financial markets compared to dollar alternatives. S&amp;P Global forecasts the petroyuan will take decades to scale meaningfully, suggesting the transition away from dollar-dominated energy markets will be gradual rather than abrupt.</p>
<p>Rather than a sudden overthrow of the petrodollar system, the emerging pattern reflects gradual diversification toward a multipolar currency landscape where the dollar maintains dominant but diminished share alongside growing roles for the yuan, euro, and potentially digital currency alternatives. China has successfully pushed for greater yuan-based oil trading with key partners, particularly those seeking to reduce exposure to dollar-based sanctions risks, but a complete replacement of the U.S. dollar remains unlikely in the foreseeable future. The most likely outcome is a multipolar currency system where energy transactions are settled in a basket of currencies chosen based on trade relationships, geopolitical considerations, and currency stability rather than exclusive reliance on any single dominant currency.</p>
