<h3>1. Winter Olympics 2026 Opens with Historic Dual Cauldron Lighting in Milan and Cortina</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2026 Winter Olympics opened with a spectacular ceremony at Milan&#39;s San Siro stadium, marking the first time in Olympic history that two cauldrons were lit simultaneously — one in Milan at the Arco della Pace and another in Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo at Piazza Dibona.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over 2,900 athletes from 93 countries marched in the Parade of Nations as the Games officially began. The ceremony featured performances from Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli, Laura Pausini, and Italian rapper Ghali, along with world-renowned pianist Lang Lang. Actor Pierfrancesco Favino and The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore also participated in the festivities. The dual cauldron lighting represented the geographical spread of the Games across the Lombardy and Veneto regions.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony took place from 2 PM to 5 PM ET, with activations occurring simultaneously in Predazzo, Livigno, and Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo in addition to the main Milan venue. Greece led the Parade of Nations as the birthplace of the Olympics, followed by the other delegations in alphabetical order according to Italian. The event organizers emphasized the sustainable and innovative aspects of these Games, which span multiple competition venues across northern Italy.</p>
<p>Italy&#39;s first Winter Olympics since Turin 2006 comes amid significant global attention, with the ceremony broadcast to an estimated worldwide audience of over 1 billion viewers. Competition begins immediately in several sports including figure skating and ski jumping. The Games will run through February 22, featuring 116 medal events across 16 disciplines.</p>

<h3>2. Balochistan Attacks Kill Over 225 as Pakistan Launches Massive Counterterrorism Operation</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Army launched &quot;Operation Herof 2.0,&quot; a coordinated assault across at least nine districts of Pakistan&#39;s Balochistan province, triggering a 40-hour military response that left at least 225 dead including militants, security personnel, and civilians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attacks began around 3:00 AM local time on January 31, targeting police stations, paramilitary outposts, a high-security prison in Quetta, and civilian vehicles across Quetta, Gwadar, Mastung, Nushki, Pasni, and Kharan. Militants employed guns, grenades, and suicide vests in what Pakistani officials described as the most significant coordinated insurgent operation in years. BLA released videos showing female fighters participating in the attacks, labeling the operation a follow-up to their August 2024 offensive.</p>
<p>Pakistani military and police forces announced the conclusion of operations on February 5, claiming to have killed 145 BLA fighters while acknowledging the deaths of 17 security personnel and 31 civilians. The BLA disputed these figures, claiming to have killed 280 security personnel and captured 18 prisoners, though provided no evidence. Pakistan deployed helicopters and drones to end the standoff, with security operations extending across multiple remote districts of the restive province.</p>
<p>The attacks highlight the ongoing insurgency in Pakistan&#39;s largest but least populated province, where separatist groups have waged a decades-long campaign against the central government. The BLA, designated a terrorist organization by Pakistan, the UK, and the US, seeks independence for the ethnic Baloch people and has increasingly targeted Chinese interests in the region, including the strategic Gwadar port. The scale of the coordinated attacks represents a significant escalation in the conflict.</p>

<h3>3. Sudan Famine Spreads as Acute Malnutrition Reaches Crisis Levels in Darfur</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acute malnutrition has reached famine levels in two additional towns in Sudan&#39;s North Darfur region, with nearly 53% of children under five suffering from acute malnutrition in Um Baru — almost double the famine threshold — according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sudan now represents the world&#39;s largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions confirmed in Al Fasher and Kadugli and the risk of famine in 20 additional areas across Greater Darfur and Greater Kordofan. Nearly 4.2 million cases of acute malnutrition are expected in 2026, including more than 800,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition — a sharp increase from 2025 levels. The UN reports that hunger is expected to worsen from February as food stocks run out and fighting continues.</p>
<p>The humanitarian catastrophe stems from the civil war that erupted in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, which has displaced over 12 million people. In the western regions of Sudan — notably North Darfur, South Darfur, West Kordofan, and South Kordofan — conflict and severely restricted humanitarian access are driving the sharp deterioration. More than 70 percent of Sudan&#39;s hospitals have been destroyed, and UN officials estimate that rehabilitating essential infrastructure will cost $350 million.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme and UNICEF have called for urgent international action to address the crisis, but aid delivery remains severely constrained by ongoing conflict and access restrictions. The government has declared 2026 &quot;the Year of Peace&quot; under a National Peace Initiative, but fighting continues in multiple regions. The UN Security Council is expected to receive a 120-day briefing on Sudan in February, with the UK — holding the Council&#39;s rotating presidency — planning to elevate the session to ministerial level.</p>

<h3>4. UAE Plans Housing Complex for Displaced Palestinians in Israeli-Controlled Southern Gaza</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United Arab Emirates has drafted plans to build the &quot;UAE Temporary Emirates Housing Complex&quot; to house thousands of displaced Palestinians in a part of southern Gaza under Israeli military control near Rafah, according to maps obtained by Reuters and Haaretz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proposed compound would sit near the &quot;Yellow Line&quot; agreed under an October ceasefire to demarcate Israeli- and Hamas-controlled areas. Rafah, once home to a quarter million people near the Egypt border, has been almost completely destroyed and depopulated by Israeli forces. The housing plan is part of broader reconstruction efforts expected to begin under U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s framework for a durable peace, with American officials hoping that building in Israeli-controlled areas could generate momentum toward Hamas&#39; disarmament.</p>
<p>The &quot;Alternative Safe Communities&quot; concept was designed as a way of gradually &quot;choking Hamas off&quot; by encouraging Gazans to leave Hamas-controlled zones, depriving the militant group of its civilian population. However, for the strategy to be effective, it would need to be built at scale, housing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Diplomats have expressed doubt about whether Palestinians would voluntarily move to areas under Israeli control.</p>
<p>International donors have been reluctant to commit funds to the plan, worried that disagreements over disarming Hamas militants could lead the parties back to full-scale conflict. The proposal has also raised concerns about potentially creating a permanent division of Gaza. Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions remain dire: UNRWA reports that Israel has blocked approximately 6,000 aid trucks destined for Gaza, with protesters blocking border crossings at Nitzana and Karem Abu Salem throughout early February.</p>

<h3>5. Japan Heads to Snap Election as PM Takaichi Seeks Mandate for Ruling Coalition</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japanese voters head to the polls on February 8 in snap elections called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan&#39;s first female premier, who is seeking to translate historically high approval ratings into a clear mandate for her Liberal Democratic Party-Japan Innovation Party coalition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The election comes just four months into Takaichi&#39;s tenure, which began on October 21, 2025, after she won the LDP presidential election. Polls show the LDP and its coalition partner are likely to secure more than 300 of the 465 seats in the House of Representatives, well above the 233 needed for a majority. Takaichi&#39;s cabinet approval rating stands at 62% in NHK surveys, with some polls placing her support in the 70% range — historically high figures that prompted the decision to call early elections.</p>
<p>The political landscape has been reshaped by a surprise opposition merger. On January 16, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, joined with Komeito — the LDP&#39;s former coalition partner for 26 years — to create a new party called the &quot;Centrist Reform Alliance.&quot; This realignment marks a significant shift in Japanese politics, with Komeito&#39;s departure from its longtime alliance with the LDP potentially signaling broader changes in the country&#39;s political dynamics.</p>
<p>Takaichi&#39;s economic program includes significant spending plans and potential tax relief measures that will be put before voters. The election is being closely watched internationally, particularly given Japan&#39;s strategic role in the U.S.-led alliance system in the Indo-Pacific and ongoing tensions with China over Taiwan. Analysts note that snap elections can be risky, but Takaichi appears to have calculated that her current popularity provides an optimal window to consolidate power.</p>

<h3>6. US-Iran Indirect Talks End &quot;For Now&quot; in Oman After Critical Nuclear Negotiations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iran announced that indirect talks with the United States mediated by Oman have concluded &quot;for now,&quot; following days of critical negotiations in Muscat where Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met separately with Omani officials and U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The talks represented a significant diplomatic effort amid weeks of escalating tensions, with negotiations shifting from the originally planned venue of Istanbul to Oman at the last minute. The Omani Foreign Minister served as intermediary, shuttling between the Iranian and American delegations. While specific details of the discussions remain confidential, the negotiations are understood to have focused on Iran&#39;s nuclear program and the broader regional security situation.</p>
<p>The talks come amid a severe domestic crisis in Iran, where protests have resulted in thousands of deaths according to human rights organizations. In a notable development during the lead-up to negotiations, Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi reportedly sent a personal message to U.S. Special Envoy Witkoff stating that Iran had canceled the planned execution of 800 anti-regime protesters. The international community has intensified pressure on Tehran, with the EU designating Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz have increased speed amid the heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran. The talks&#39; inconclusive ending — characterized by Iran as suspended &quot;for now&quot; rather than collapsed — leaves open the possibility of resumed negotiations, though the timeline and conditions remain unclear. Both sides face significant domestic political constraints that complicate any potential agreement.</p>

<h3>7. Starmer Apologizes to Epstein Victims as Mandelson Scandal Deepens UK Leadership Crisis</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer apologized to Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s victims for appointing Peter Mandelson as U.S. Ambassador, as Scotland Yard launched a criminal investigation into the veteran Labour politician on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he shared government information with the convicted sex offender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scandal has plunged Starmer&#39;s government into crisis, with Labour MPs describing the party mood as &quot;febrile and mutinous.&quot; Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party on February 1 and has since stepped down from the House of Lords amid mounting scrutiny. Leaked documents revealed serious allegations including reports that Mandelson and his husband received payments from Epstein, and that in 2009 and 2010, Mandelson allegedly passed sensitive government information to the financier.</p>
<p>Starmer defended his initial decision to appoint Mandelson, stating: &quot;If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government.&quot; Officials are reportedly drafting legislation to fast-track the removal of Mandelson&#39;s peerage. The Prime Minister is facing growing calls for his resignation, with critics arguing his handling of the issue has undermined public trust and raised national security concerns stemming from poor vetting processes.</p>
<p>The crisis comes at a challenging time for the UK government, with borrowing costs under pressure and the pound facing volatility. UK gilt yields have risen as markets assess the political uncertainty. The scandal has dominated British media coverage and Parliament, overshadowing the government&#39;s policy agenda. Opposition leaders have demanded a full independent inquiry into how Mandelson&#39;s appointment was approved despite his documented connections to Epstein.</p>

<h3>8. Taiwan-China Tensions Escalate as Beijing Masses 100,000 Troops for Strait Exercises</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>China has assembled nearly 100,000 troops along the Taiwan Strait for military exercises, with December drills involving 90 aircraft sorties crossing the center line, four amphibious assault ship formations, and 19 Chinese ships entering Taiwan&#39;s 24-mile buffer zone in what analysts describe as rehearsals for blockade scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Justice Mission&quot; exercises marked the first instance of Chinese military and coast guard vessels entering Taiwan&#39;s contiguous zone in significant numbers, representing a significant escalation in Beijing&#39;s pressure campaign. The late-year drills were widely interpreted as practice for coercive scenarios short of outright war — particularly a blockade or quarantine designed to strangle Taiwan economically and politically without triggering immediate global conflict.</p>
<p>Pentagon assessments indicate China aims to achieve by 2027 the capabilities required to prevail in a Taiwan conflict involving the United States. This requires three integrated strategic capabilities: the ability to credibly win at acceptable cost, deterring or constraining American intervention, and deterring involvement of U.S. allies and partners. The U.S. recently approved an $11 billion arms package for Taiwan and condemned Beijing&#39;s &quot;provocative&quot; military drills.</p>
<p>Despite the military buildup, life in Taiwan continues largely normally, with residents expressing determination rather than fear. The State Department has urged &quot;Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue.&quot; However, China has rejected such calls, framing U.S. arms sales as the primary threat to cross-strait stability. Analysts note that while invasion remains unlikely in the near term, the risk of miscalculation during increasingly aggressive exercises continues to grow.</p>

<h3>9. Mexico&#39;s Sheinbaum Defies Trump, Vows Nation &quot;Will Never Be Colony or Protectorate&quot;</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum delivered a defiant address marking the 109th anniversary of Mexico&#39;s 1917 Constitution, declaring &quot;México no regresará a ser colonia ni protectorado de nadie&quot; (Mexico will not return to being a colony or protectorate of anyone) while pledging to protect national resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speech came amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration over immigration, trade, and cartel violence. Sheinbaum directly rebutted Trump&#39;s assertions that criminal organizations control Mexico, stating on February 4: &quot;It is false that cartels govern Mexico.&quot; The rhetorical confrontation follows Trump&#39;s characterization of Mexico as a &quot;narco-state&quot; and his threats of significant tariffs and other punitive measures.</p>
<p>Despite the tensions, Mexico has maintained humanitarian assistance to Cuba, with Sheinbaum pledging to send food and other supplies while pursuing diplomatic channels to continue oil shipments &quot;without seeking confrontation.&quot; The Cuba issue has become another flashpoint with Washington, as Trump has escalated pressure on the island nation by cutting off oil supplies. Mexico&#39;s position reflects its traditional foreign policy principles of non-intervention and solidarity with Latin American neighbors.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum has also focused on domestic infrastructure development, conducting a two-day tour of Sonora where she inaugurated a highway and announced plans for a port modernization project on the Gulf of California. Her approval ratings remain strong despite the external pressures, as she seeks to balance Mexico&#39;s critical economic relationship with the United States against assertions of national sovereignty. The Trump administration&#39;s deportation operations and trade threats continue to test the bilateral relationship.</p>

<h3>10. North Korea Dismisses Vice Premier Ahead of Major Party Congress Unveiling Nuclear Plans</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kim Jong Un has dismissed a vice premier over troubles in a factory modernization project as he tightens discipline among officials ahead of a major Workers&#39; Party congress where North Korea plans to unveil &quot;next-stage plans for further bolstering up the country&#39;s nuclear war deterrent.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming party congress, the first of its kind in five years, represents one of the authoritarian regime&#39;s biggest propaganda spectacles and is intended to review projects, establish political and economic priorities, and reshuffle officials. Kim has been focusing on showcasing agricultural and infrastructure achievements, opening North Korea&#39;s largest greenhouse farm on the Chinese border and inaugurating the Sambaing Stockbreeding Farm with &quot;fashionable houses,&quot; a solar power station, hospital, and kindergarten.</p>
<p>Rising revenues from foreign trade and cybercrime are giving Kim greater policy options, enabling him to suppress certain economic sectors and pursue military priorities with fewer constraints. The regime ordered boosted missile production in 2026 and has conducted multiple ballistic missile tests in recent months. The Congress will likely formalize new military doctrines and potentially announce leadership changes as Kim consolidates power.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch&#39;s annual report described North Korea as maintaining &quot;unrelenting repression, hunger, and inequality,&quot; noting continued severe restrictions on freedoms and information. The international community has limited visibility into internal regime dynamics, though analysts suggest the dismissal of senior officials signals ongoing concerns about meeting Kim&#39;s ambitious modernization targets. The party congress dates have not been officially announced but are expected in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3>1. Wall Street Selloff Turns Into Stampede as Emerging Markets Post Worst Week Since November</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wall Street&#39;s retreat from risk accelerated into a full stampede this week, with emerging markets on track for their steepest weekly decline since November as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 1.5% on Friday and Korean shares triggered a circuit breaker after a 5% dive in the KOSPI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff has been driven by a steady drumbeat of negative news stoking anxiety about valuations many suspected had already run up too far. Alphabet&#39;s announcement of up to $185 billion in 2026 AI capital expenditures spooked investors concerned about the financial impact of massive AI investments. Rather than a single trigger, the rout reflects accumulated concerns about tech valuations, rising layoffs, and uncertainty over monetary policy.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 has now turned negative for 2026 after losing 1.23% on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.59%. Korean markets saw three program-trading halts in five sessions during one of the most volatile weeks in recent years, with the Kospi falling more than 5% in a single session before retail investors stepped in to prevent a break below 5,000. The carnage has spread across asset classes, with gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies all experiencing sharp declines.</p>
<p>The broader market tracked declines across Asian peers after Wall Street closed mostly lower overnight, amid a persistent tech sector selloff. Most &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; mega-cap names remain under pressure, though the divergence between AI infrastructure enablers and application-layer software companies has become increasingly pronounced. Investors face limited visibility with the January jobs report delayed indefinitely due to the government shutdown.</p>

<h3>2. US January Layoffs Hit Highest Level Since 2009 as Hiring Plans Collapse</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S.-based employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January — a threefold increase from December and more than double January 2025 — marking the highest January layoff total since 2009, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About 40% of the January layoff announcements came from just two firms: UPS (30,000 cuts tied to its wind-down of Amazon delivery arrangements) and Amazon (16,000 cuts). The healthcare industry announced more than 17,000 job cuts, the highest in that sector since April 2020. January&#39;s layoff announcements were concentrated in five industries: transportation, technology, healthcare and health products, chemicals, and financial services.</p>
<p>Companies announced just 5,306 new hires in January, also the lowest for the month since Challenger began tracking the data in 2009. Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 31 rose to 231,000, an increase of 22,000 from the prior week. The data paints a picture of a &quot;low-hire, low-fire&quot; environment that appears to be deteriorating as employers grow pessimistic about the 2026 outlook.</p>
<p>The labor market weakness comes at a particularly challenging time, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics unable to release the January jobs report due to the government shutdown. &quot;Most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026,&quot; noted Andy Challenger. The data may fuel concerns among Federal Reserve policymakers about whether additional support is needed for the economy.</p>

<h3>3. AMD Crashes 17% in Worst Rout Since 2017 as AI Guidance Disappoints</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices suffered its worst single-day decline since 2017, plunging 17% after issuing first-quarter guidance that fell short of the market&#39;s most bullish AI expectations despite posting record Q4 revenue of $10.27 billion — up 23% year-over-year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff erased more than $60 billion in market capitalization in a single trading session, with shares closing at $200.19. AMD guided Q1 revenue of approximately $9.8 billion — a 5% sequential decline that investors interpreted as a sign of slowing momentum despite the figure exceeding analyst consensus of $9.38 billion. In a market conditioned to expect &quot;Nvidia-style&quot; exponential growth every quarter, this seasonal dip triggered massive profit-taking.</p>
<p>Prior to the crash, AMD shares had roughly doubled over the past year amid the AI infrastructure boom. CEO Lisa Su noted that the company is in &quot;active discussions&quot; for additional sales of its next-generation MI450 chip, with the ramp &quot;on schedule to start in the second half of the year.&quot; However, concerns mounted that a significant portion of Q4 data center revenue came from $390 million in China-bound AI chip sales approved under a U.S. license.</p>
<p>Cathie Wood&#39;s ARK Invest responded to the crash by purchasing $28 million in AMD shares. Deutsche Bank maintained a hold rating, noting the second half of 2026 could be an inflection point, while Barclays maintained an overweight rating with a $300 price target implying 24% upside. The reaction reflects a broader challenge facing semiconductor companies outside of Nvidia: even strong results are being punished when guidance fails to meet the most optimistic scenarios.</p>

<h3>4. Oracle Announces $50 Billion Capital Raise for Cloud Infrastructure Expansion</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion in 2026 through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, reflecting the unprecedented scale of financing needed to meet AI-driven demand from major customers including AMD, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, TikTok, and xAI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The financing structure will see approximately half raised through equity-linked and common equity issuances, including mandatory convertible preferred securities and a new at-the-market equity program of up to $20 billion. The debt portion will be completed through a single investment-grade senior unsecured bond issuance early in 2026. Goldman Sachs will lead the bond offering, while Citigroup will lead the equity issuances.</p>
<p>Oracle&#39;s announcement underscores the massive capital requirements facing cloud infrastructure providers competing for AI workloads. Unlike hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that can largely self-fund expansion, Oracle is turning to capital markets to keep pace with contracted demand from its largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers. The raise represents one of the largest corporate capital raises in recent memory.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s stock has benefited from the AI infrastructure buildout, with Oracle positioning itself as a key player in providing the computing capacity needed for training and running large language models. The capital raise will fund new data centers, server procurement, and networking infrastructure. Analysts note that while the dilutive impact of equity issuance is a concern, Oracle&#39;s contracted backlog provides visibility into future revenue streams that justify the investment.</p>

<h3>5. Nvidia-OpenAI $100 Billion Deal Stalls as Negotiations Go &quot;On Ice&quot;</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five months after OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion deal, no contract has been signed and no money has changed hands, with Wall Street Journal reporting that negotiations are &quot;on ice&quot; after Nvidia executives expressed doubts about OpenAI&#39;s business model and lack of business discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has told industry associates that the investment was &quot;nonbinding and not finalized,&quot; while criticizing what he characterized as insufficient discipline in OpenAI&#39;s business strategy. Huang also shared concerns about competition from firms like Google and Anthropic. Since the deal was announced, the relationship has become more complicated: Nvidia has invested in rival AI labs, while OpenAI struck a $10 billion deal with chip startup Cerebras and has pursued partnerships with AMD and Broadcom for custom AI chips.</p>
<p>Huang publicly denied reports that he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling such characterizations &quot;nonsense&quot; and stating: &quot;We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time.&quot; However, analysts suggest any eventual investment will likely be in the $20-30 billion range rather than the originally announced $100 billion.</p>
<p>The stalled negotiations highlight the evolving dynamics in the AI industry, where the largest players are increasingly hedging their bets across multiple partnerships and technologies. Nvidia&#39;s dominant position in AI chips gives it leverage in these negotiations, while OpenAI&#39;s need for computing capacity to train next-generation models creates pressure to secure supply from multiple sources. The ultimate resolution of these talks will signal how the AI ecosystem&#39;s major players are aligning for the next phase of competition.</p>

<h3>6. Uber Falls 5% Despite Record Quarter as Guidance Disappoints</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uber shares dropped 5.2% after the company reported record Q4 results including 3.6 billion trips and 200 million monthly active users, but issued Q1 2026 guidance below Wall Street&#39;s aggressive targets for both mobility and delivery segments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company reported Q4 revenue of $14.37 billion, a 20% year-over-year increase, but adjusted EPS of $0.71 missed the analyst consensus of $0.80 by nearly 11%. The shortfall was largely attributed to a $1.6 billion pre-tax headwind from equity investment revaluations and rising operational costs. For Q1 2026, Uber projected adjusted EBITDA and bookings below expectations, suggesting a sequential slowdown in demand.</p>
<p>Lyft shares fell 3.1% in sympathy with Uber&#39;s decline, with the rival ride-hailing company scheduled to report its own Q4 results on February 10. The weak guidance from Uber raises questions about the broader on-demand economy&#39;s trajectory as consumers face persistent inflation pressures. Both companies have been expanding into new verticals including autonomous vehicles, grocery delivery, and advertising.</p>
<p>Despite the guidance concerns, Uber announced plans to expand autonomous vehicle trips to up to 15 cities by year-end, including Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Munich, Hong Kong, Zurich, and Madrid. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi stated that by 2029, Uber intends to be the world&#39;s largest facilitator of autonomous vehicle trips. The company&#39;s AV strategy — partnering with technology companies rather than building its own self-driving systems — positions it to benefit regardless of which autonomous technology ultimately prevails.</p>

<h3>7. ECB and Bank of England Hold Rates Steady Amid Growth and Inflation Uncertainty</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank held interest rates unchanged at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, while the Bank of England voted 5-4 to maintain rates at 3.75% in a closer-than-expected decision that signals internal divisions over the pace of monetary easing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ECB commented that inflation trajectory and economic conditions did not warrant a move, but warned the outlook was &quot;unpredictable&quot; given tariff threats and currency volatility. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the rest of 2026, with ECB President Lagarde playing down concerns about the euro&#39;s recent rally. The updated assessment confirms that inflation should stabilize at the 2% target in the medium term.</p>
<p>The Bank of England&#39;s decision was notably closer than expected, with four members voting to cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.5% versus forecasts of a 7-2 hold. The narrow margin demonstrates building pressure for rate cuts despite inflation remaining above target. Pay growth and services price inflation have generally continued to ease, reflecting the impact of monetary policy and evidence of subdued economic growth.</p>
<p>Both central banks face challenging balancing acts as they navigate persistent inflation pressures against slowing growth and external risks from potential U.S. tariffs. UK borrowing costs have come under pressure amid the Mandelson political crisis, while eurozone economies grapple with weak manufacturing and uncertain trade policy. Economists expect the Bank of England could begin cutting as early as March or April if economic data weakens further.</p>

<h3>8. ARM Holdings Beats Estimates as Chip Designer Posts Fourth Consecutive Billion-Dollar Quarter</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ARM Holdings reported Q3 fiscal 2026 earnings of $0.43 per share, beating the $0.41 consensus, with revenue rising 26% to $1.24 billion as the chip designer extends its record-breaking momentum driven by AI-related demand for its processor architectures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>License revenue rose 25% to $505 million while royalty revenue increased 27% to $737 million, driven by higher royalty rates for newer products like Armv9 and Arm compute subsystems. The company provided strong Q4 guidance with EPS of $0.54-0.62 (versus consensus of $0.49) and revenue of $1.4-1.5 billion (above the $1.4 billion consensus), marking what would be its ninth consecutive earnings beat.</p>
<p>ARM shares initially traded lower following the after-hours report before recovering during the regular session the next day. The volatile reaction reflects the heightened scrutiny facing semiconductor stocks amid the broader tech selloff, even when companies deliver strong results. ARM&#39;s business model — licensing chip designs rather than manufacturing them — provides exposure to virtually every segment of the semiconductor market.</p>
<p>The company benefits from the proliferation of AI across devices from data centers to smartphones, with its power-efficient architectures increasingly favored for AI inference workloads. ARM&#39;s customer base includes nearly every major technology company, providing diversified exposure to the AI buildout. Analysts note that ARM&#39;s royalty rate increases on newer chip designs could drive continued revenue growth even if unit shipments stabilize.</p>

<h3>9. Philip Morris Reports Record Year as Smoke-Free Products Reach 41.5% of Sales</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philip Morris International reported full-year 2025 results with net revenue reaching $40.6 billion and smoke-free products rising to 41.5% of total sales, while guiding for 11-13% EPS growth in 2026 and setting new three-year targets for revenue and operating income growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q4 results came in line with expectations, with adjusted diluted EPS of $7.54 for the full year representing growth of 14.8% versus 2024. The company&#39;s transformation away from traditional cigarettes continues to accelerate, with smoke-free products now comprising more than $17 billion of annual revenue. PMI set 2026-2028 compound annual growth targets of 6-8% for net revenues on an organic basis and 9-11% for adjusted diluted EPS.</p>
<p>The company described 2025 as &quot;another remarkable year of results&quot; with a fifth consecutive year of volume growth and strong operating margin expansion. Shares traded down 1.4% to $179.50 following the release, with investors having largely priced in the strong performance. The 2026 guidance suggests continued momentum in the company&#39;s pivot toward reduced-risk products including heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.</p>
<p>PMI&#39;s transformation story contrasts with challenges facing traditional tobacco companies as smoking rates decline in developed markets. The company&#39;s IQOS heated tobacco system and ZYN nicotine pouches have emerged as significant growth drivers. However, management warned of global pricing declines in the low- to mid-teens percentage range driven by its deal with the Trump administration, new direct-to-consumer pricing, and lower Medicaid pricing on older products.</p>

<h3>10. KOSPI Triggers Three Circuit Breakers in Five Sessions as Korean Markets Whipsaw</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>South Korea&#39;s stock market experienced one of its most volatile weeks in recent memory, with three program-trading halts triggered in five sessions as the KOSPI swung between daily drops of over 5% and rallies of nearly 7%, testing investor resolve during the global tech selloff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The circuit breaker mechanism — triggered when KOSPI 200 futures move more than 5% from the previous day&#39;s close within a single minute — activated repeatedly as global tech concerns cascaded through Asian markets. On Monday, the Kospi fell 5.26% in a single session, triggering a brief halt and breaking below the 5,000 level. A day later it surged 6.84%, forcing another halt. Friday saw a third sidecar activation as panic selling briefly sent the index below 4,900.</p>
<p>Retail investors provided crucial support during the volatility, stepping in to buy during the sharpest selloffs and keeping the benchmark above 5,000 by Friday&#39;s close. The Korean market&#39;s sensitivity to tech sector sentiment reflects its heavy weighting toward semiconductor and electronics companies, particularly Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, which are exposed to global AI-related demand fluctuations.</p>
<p>The extreme volatility highlights how concentrated bets on AI-related themes have created fragile market conditions that can unwind rapidly when sentiment shifts. Korean shares led the emerging market selloff, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index posting its steepest weekly decline since November. Analysts note that while fundamental valuations have become more attractive, technical damage from the volatility may take time to repair.</p>

<h2>Geopolitical News (Top 10)</h2>
<h3>1. Suicide Bombing at Islamabad Mosque Kills 31 During Friday Prayers</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A suicide bomber detonated explosives at a Shia mosque in Islamabad&#39;s Tarlai Kalan area during Friday prayers, killing at least 31 worshippers and wounding 169 others in the deadliest attack on the Pakistani capital since 2008.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The explosion struck the Khadija Tul Kubra Mosque during Friday prayers, with security guards attempting to intercept the suspect before he opened fire and detonated his explosives among worshippers. Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif alleged the attacker had been traveling to and from Afghanistan, though investigations are ongoing. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, though early investigations had pointed to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which subsequently denied any connection.</p>
<p>The attack represents a dramatic escalation of violence in Pakistan&#39;s capital, which had been relatively insulated from the militant attacks plaguing other parts of the country. The last major attack in Islamabad was the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing that killed 63 people and wounded over 250. The targeting of a Shia mosque during prayers follows a pattern of sectarian violence that has claimed thousands of lives in Pakistan over the past two decades.</p>
<p>The bombing comes as Pakistan grapples with a broader surge in militant violence following mass attacks in Balochistan that killed over 225 people last month. The government has launched Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, a major counterterrorism campaign, but the Islamabad attack demonstrates the persistent security challenges facing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif&#39;s administration. Security forces have been deployed across the capital as authorities investigate the network behind the attack.</p>
<h3>2. US and Russia Restore Military-to-Military Dialogue After Abu Dhabi Talks</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States and Russia agreed to reestablish high-level military communication channels for the first time since late 2021, marking a significant thaw in relations following the second round of Ukraine peace talks in Abu Dhabi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The announcement came at the conclusion of two days of US-brokered negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in the United Arab Emirates. White House special envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed that the restored communication channel will &quot;provide consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace.&quot; The development represents the most significant diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Moscow since Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>Beyond the military dialogue agreement, the talks produced a prisoner exchange with Ukraine and Russia each releasing 157 prisoners of war—the first such swap in five months. However, substantive progress on core issues including territorial arrangements and a ceasefire remained elusive. Witkoff acknowledged that &quot;greater efforts would be required to advance a comprehensive settlement of the conflict,&quot; with key differences over Ukraine&#39;s NATO aspirations and the status of Russian-occupied territories remaining unresolved.</p>
<p>The resumption of military contacts addresses one of the most dangerous aspects of the US-Russia breakdown—the absence of direct communication channels that could prevent miscalculation between nuclear powers. European allies have expressed cautious optimism about the talks while emphasizing the need for continued support to Ukraine. The next round of negotiations has not yet been scheduled, though both sides indicated willingness to continue the dialogue.</p>
<h3>3. US-Iran Nuclear Talks End in Oman with Both Sides Claiming Progress</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the indirect nuclear negotiations in Muscat as &quot;a good start&quot; after Oman mediated between US and Iranian delegations, though no concrete roadmap emerged to alleviate fears of potential military confrontation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iran&#39;s negotiating team, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, engaged in indirect talks with a US delegation that included special envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and Central Command chief Brad Cooper—the most senior US military commander in the region. Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi shuttled between the two sides throughout Friday, conveying messages and clarifying positions. The talks were described as useful for understanding both sides&#39; thinking and identifying areas for possible progress.</p>
<p>The negotiations took place against a backdrop of heightened military tension, with the USS Abraham Lincoln supercarrier positioned near Iranian waters and the US strengthening air defenses at bases across the region. President Trump had issued blunt warnings to Iran&#39;s leadership ahead of the talks, while Tehran maintained it was &quot;ready to respond to any US attack.&quot; The oil-rich Middle East remains on edge as markets attempt to price in the probability of conflict versus diplomatic resolution.</p>
<p>Iran sought to limit discussions strictly to its nuclear program, while Washington pushed to include ballistic missiles, regional proxy groups, and human rights concerns related to the ongoing crackdown on protests that has killed over 6,400 people. The format differences that nearly derailed the talks in Turkey were navigated through Oman&#39;s mediation, with Araghchi stating the talks are &quot;on hold for now&quot; while both sides assess next steps. No date has been set for a follow-up round.</p>
<h3>4. South Africa Signs Trade Framework with China as Trump Tariffs Strain US Relations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>China and South Africa signed a framework agreement that would give South African goods duty-free access to Chinese markets, as Africa&#39;s largest economy seeks alternatives following 30% US tariffs and a diplomatic fallout with the Trump administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The agreement, announced Friday in Pretoria, would start negotiations over a deal covering South African exports such as fruit while giving China enhanced investment opportunities, particularly in the automotive sector where Chinese car sales have grown rapidly. South Africa&#39;s trade ministry said it expected the deal to be finalized by the end of March, marking a significant pivot in the country&#39;s trade relationships.</p>
<p>The move comes as US-South Africa diplomatic ties have plunged to their worst point in decades. The Trump administration has accused South Africa of pursuing an anti-American foreign policy and allowing what it describes as the violent persecution of a white minority group. Beyond the 30% reciprocal tariffs on South African goods, Trump has barred South Africa from participating in Group of 20 meetings in the United States this year, further isolating Pretoria from traditional Western partners.</p>
<p>The framework represents a broader realignment as developing nations seek to diversify trade relationships amid the US tariff regime. China has been actively courting countries facing high US duties, offering alternative market access and investment. For South Africa, the deal provides potential relief from the economic impact of US tariffs while deepening ties with Beijing—a calculation being made by an increasing number of nations navigating the new trade landscape.</p>
<h3>5. Turkey and Israel Clash Over Competing Visions for Post-Assad Syria</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tensions between Ankara and Tel Aviv have escalated sharply over Syria&#39;s future, with Israel conducting nearly 1,000 airstrikes since Assad&#39;s fall while Turkey supports a strong centralized Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first seven months following Assad&#39;s collapse in late 2024, Israel conducted 988 air and artillery strikes—nearly triple the 334 airstrikes carried out over the previous seven years. Turkish officials have condemned the attacks as destabilizing, arguing that Israel seeks to ensure Syria remains weak and fragmented. Turkey views the regime&#39;s fall as an opportunity to foster stability through a strong, centralized Syrian state allied with Ankara.</p>
<p>The rivalry has created a volatile security environment for Syria&#39;s transitional government. President al-Sharaa, who became the first Syrian leader to visit the White House since independence, faces the challenge of asserting sovereignty while foreign powers pursue competing interests on Syrian territory. Serious clashes continue with minorities, notably Druze and Alawites, further complicating the consolidation of central authority.</p>
<p>The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed to incorporate its governance and military apparatus into Syrian state institutions, with Kurdish leader Nour al-Din Issa Ahmad appointed as governor of Al-Hasakah Governorate. However, key details remain unresolved, and analysts warn that without progress in talks, Damascus could attempt to take SDF-held areas by force. The situation in Syria remains one of the most complex geopolitical challenges of 2026, with regional powers jockeying for influence in the post-Assad order.</p>
<h3>6. Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti Hold Trilateral Summit Amid Port Deal Tensions</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presidents Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia and Ismaïl Omar Guelleh of Djibouti met with Ethiopian leaders in Jigjiga for trilateral talks focused on economic integration and security cooperation, even as the Ethiopia-Somaliland port dispute remains unresolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The summit brought together the three Horn of Africa leaders to discuss cooperation on shared regional priorities including infrastructure, connectivity, and counter-terrorism coordination. Ethiopia is positioning renewable electricity exports at the center of regional transformation, with the 120-megawatt Aysha II Wind Project near the Djibouti border inaugurated during the meetings as a symbol of energy integration efforts.</p>
<p>However, significant tensions persist between Ethiopia and Somalia over the Memorandum of Understanding Addis Ababa signed with Somaliland in January granting Ethiopia access to a Red Sea port. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its sovereign territory and has demanded Ethiopia withdraw from the agreement. Two rounds of Turkey-mediated talks between the two nations in 2025 failed to resolve the dispute, leaving relations strained despite the trilateral engagement.</p>
<p>The US military signaled deeper security and economic engagement with East Africa during recent visits to Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti by AFRICOM leadership. The broader strategy aims to address growing security threats while competing with Chinese and Russian influence in the strategic region. The trilateral summit, despite its focus on cooperation, underscores the complex web of alliances and disputes that characterize Horn of Africa geopolitics.</p>
<h3>7. Philippines Pushes for Binding South China Sea Code of Conduct During ASEAN Chair</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As ASEAN chairman for 2026, the Philippines announced monthly working group meetings aimed at concluding negotiations on a legally binding South China Sea code of conduct with China before year-end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has made the code of conduct a centerpiece of Manila&#39;s ASEAN chairmanship, convening regular working-level meetings to maintain momentum in talks that have dragged on for over two decades. The Philippines is adamant that any agreement should be legally binding and monitored by ASEAN-led mechanisms—a stance strongly opposed by China, which prefers a more flexible arrangement that preserves its expansive territorial claims.</p>
<p>The diplomatic push comes alongside a dramatic expansion of US-Philippines military cooperation, with more than 500 joint activities planned for 2026. Marcos has strengthened security ties with Washington while attempting to manage tensions with Beijing, though the rate of incidents in disputed waters has accelerated. Analysts note that escalating clashes have not only raised the urgency of a regional code of conduct but created a volatile environment where the threshold for conflict is lowering.</p>
<p>China has responded to the Philippines&#39; pro-US tilt with increasingly assertive behavior in the South China Sea. Beijing maintains that bilateral negotiations rather than multilateral frameworks should govern maritime disputes, rejecting the 2016 international arbitral ruling that invalidated most of China&#39;s claims. The ASEAN chairmanship gives Manila a platform to advance its preferred approach, though success will require navigating significant resistance from Beijing.</p>
<h3>8. Supreme Court Delays Ruling on Trump IEEPA Tariffs Until February 20</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court did not issue its highly anticipated ruling on the legality of Trump&#39;s emergency tariffs before a month-long recess, leaving $195 billion in collected duties in limbo and potential refunds hanging on the February 20 decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case will determine two critical issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy tariffs, and whether the US must reimburse importers who have already paid the duties. Tariffs collected under IEEPA brought in approximately $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion so far in 2026, according to Treasury data.</p>
<p>The stakes extend beyond refunds to the entire US trade policy framework. If the Supreme Court rules the IEEPA tariffs unconstitutional, the Trump administration has indicated it has backup plans using other legal authorities including Sections 122, 338, 301, and 232. However, analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics note that each alternative statute is either narrow, temporary, or specific—none can recreate the across-the-board tariff wall enabled by IEEPA.</p>
<p>The customs bond market has ballooned alongside the tariffs, with billions of dollars in collateral posted by importers now contingent on the court&#39;s decision. Businesses have been stockpiling goods ahead of potential tariff increases while simultaneously planning for possible refunds, creating significant uncertainty across supply chains. The delay adds another three weeks of limbo for companies trying to plan around the unpredictable trade environment.</p>
<h3>9. NATO Wargame Reveals Defense Readiness Gaps as Europe Prepares for Reduced US Role</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A major NATO military exercise exposed significant capability gaps in European defense readiness as the 2026 National Defense Strategy formalized US expectations that Europe take primary responsibility for conventional defense against Russia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exercise, conducted across NATO&#39;s eastern flank, tested alliance responses to various threat scenarios and highlighted shortfalls in ammunition stocks, air defense coverage, and rapid deployment capabilities. The findings underscore the urgency of European defense spending increases as the US pivots its conventional force posture toward the Indo-Pacific theater. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has emphasized that Europe can no longer rely on the US to underwrite its conventional defense.</p>
<p>The 2026 National Defense Strategy continues a &quot;one plus&quot; conflict approach with a significant change: if the United States is involved in a conflict with China, the defense of Europe against any Russian aggression will be NATO&#39;s responsibility. Washington will retain its nuclear deterrent role and provide high-end enablers but will no longer underwrite Europe&#39;s conventional defense by default. The shift has accelerated European defense investments, with the EU&#39;s ReArm Europe plan aiming to mobilize €800 billion across member states.</p>
<p>Experts identify a ceasefire in Ukraine on Russia&#39;s terms as a top-tier risk for European security, rating it high in both likelihood and impact. Russia is expected to step up its shadow war on Europe through infrastructure attacks and democracy disruption. The wargame results are being used to prioritize defense investments, with particular focus on air defense systems, long-range strike capabilities, and logistics infrastructure across NATO&#39;s eastern member states.</p>
<h3>10. Colombia&#39;s Petro Meets Trump Amid Drug Trafficking Tensions</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro traveled to Washington for talks with President Trump as the two nations navigate tensions over drug trafficking policy and regional fallout from the January capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meeting comes weeks after Trump&#39;s January 3 military strike in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of Maduro—an action that sent shockwaves through Latin America. Colombian President Petro, along with Brazilian President Lula da Silva and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, had condemned the US intervention as crossing &quot;an unacceptable line.&quot; The face-to-face meeting aims to stabilize bilateral relations strained by both the Venezuela situation and disagreements over counter-narcotics strategy.</p>
<p>Colombia remains the world&#39;s largest cocaine producer, and the Trump administration has pressed Bogotá for more aggressive eradication and interdiction measures. Petro has championed a harm-reduction approach that emphasizes addressing demand and providing alternatives for coca farmers, creating friction with Washington&#39;s enforcement-focused preferences. The talks are expected to address both policy differences and potential areas of cooperation.</p>
<p>The broader regional context adds complexity to the discussions. Venezuela&#39;s interim leader Delcy Rodríguez has moved to privatize the country&#39;s oil industry, potentially opening opportunities for US companies but also creating new dynamics along Colombia&#39;s border with its neighbor. The Petro-Trump meeting represents an effort to manage disagreements while maintaining cooperation on security issues that affect both nations.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 10)</h2>
<h3>1. Dow Jones Crosses 50,000 for First Time as Markets Stage Historic Rebound</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,207 points to close above 50,000 for the first time in history, with the S&amp;P 500 jumping 2% and the Nasdaq advancing 2.2% as technology stocks recovered from their worst rout in months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blue-chip index closed at 50,115.67, gaining 2.47% in its biggest single-day point gain of 2026. The rally represented a dramatic reversal from Thursday&#39;s selloff, with investor sentiment stabilizing after days of heavy selling in the technology sector. Nvidia led the recovery with a 7.4% surge, contributing nearly 200 points to the Dow&#39;s total gain, while Microsoft jumped 4% on strong Azure cloud performance.</p>
<p>The rebound came as Wall Street&#39;s fear gauge, the VIX, dropped back below 20 after spiking earlier in the week during the tech selloff. Consumer sentiment data provided additional support, with the University of Michigan survey showing a headline reading of 57.3—better than the 55.0 consensus estimate—while near-term inflation expectations fell to 3.5% from 4%, the lowest since January 2025.</p>
<p>Caterpillar emerged as a standout performer, hitting an all-time high of $723.32 as the industrial giant reported strong demand for its AI-powered autonomous mining and construction equipment. The company&#39;s record backlog and exposure to data center power generation positioned it as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout. The Dow milestone marks the index&#39;s fastest 5,000-point climb since reaching 45,000 in December 2024.</p>
<h3>2. Amazon Plunges 8% as $200 Billion AI Spending Plan Spooks Investors</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon shares dropped sharply Friday after the e-commerce giant announced plans to spend approximately $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2026—roughly one-third higher than Wall Street had forecast—primarily to expand cloud and AI infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company had reported mixed Q4 results after Thursday&#39;s close, with revenue of $213.4 billion exceeding forecasts while earnings per share of $1.95 missed the $1.98 estimate. AWS cloud growth of 24% was the fastest in 13 quarters, but investors focused on the aggressive spending outlook rather than operational performance. The stock opened sharply lower and remained under pressure throughout Friday&#39;s session despite the broader market rally.</p>
<p>The magnitude of Amazon&#39;s capex guidance—roughly $54 billion above analyst expectations—crystallized concerns that have haunted technology investors throughout earnings season. Alphabet&#39;s $185 billion spending plan and Microsoft&#39;s $80 billion commitment have already raised questions about the return on massive AI investments. Amazon&#39;s announcement suggested the spending race shows no signs of slowing, with unclear timelines for when these investments will translate into proportionate revenue growth.</p>
<p>The reaction underscored a growing divide in investor sentiment between companies benefiting from AI spending (like Nvidia and Caterpillar) and those doing the spending. CEO Andy Jassy defended the investments as necessary to meet surging demand for AI compute capacity, but the stock&#39;s decline reflected skepticism about near-term margin pressures. The contrast with the broader market rally highlighted the rotation within technology away from AI infrastructure investors toward infrastructure beneficiaries.</p>
<h3>3. Bitcoin Crashes to 15-Month Low Near $60,000 as Crypto Rout Continues</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin plunged as low as $60,033 in Friday&#39;s Asian trading session before stabilizing around $64,500, extending a selloff that has erased nearly 50% from October&#39;s record high and triggered over $1 billion in liquidations in 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency has now fallen approximately 50% from its peak of $126,272 reached in October 2025, with the decline wiping out all gains since President Trump&#39;s election victory had triggered a speculative rush into digital assets. More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, including about $980 million in bullish leveraged bets forced to close as prices dropped.</p>
<p>The decline accelerated after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the government has no authority to stabilize crypto markets, dashing hopes among some advocates that the Trump administration might intervene. Institutional outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued, with investment declining in recent months and reducing trade volumes. Glassnode analysts recorded the second-largest investor capitulation in two years.</p>
<p>Friday&#39;s partial stabilization came as the broader risk-on sentiment lifted most asset classes, with Bitcoin recovering from its lows alongside the equity rally. However, the cryptocurrency&#39;s correlation with technology stocks has left it vulnerable to the broader rotation out of risk assets. The Fear and Greed Index stands at 12 points—indicating &quot;extreme fear&quot;—as traders debate whether the flush represents capitulation or a pause before further decline.</p>
<h3>4. UBS Posts Strong Earnings but Stock Slides 5% on US Wealth Outflows</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported Q4 net profit of $1.2 billion—up 56% year-over-year—and announced a $3 billion share buyback for 2026, but shares dropped after revealing client outflows from its US wealth management division.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bank delivered full-year net profit of $7.8 billion, up 53% from 2024, with group invested assets exceeding $7 trillion for the first time. UBS raised its dividend 22% to $1.10 per share and set ambitious 2028 targets including an 18% return on CET1 capital and a 67% cost-to-income ratio. The results demonstrated continued progress in integrating Credit Suisse, acquired in 2023&#39;s emergency rescue.</p>
<p>However, investors focused on concerning trends in the US wealth management business, where client outflows raised questions about UBS&#39;s ability to compete for high-net-worth Americans amid a crowded competitive landscape. The stock dropped 5.2% in Zurich trading to 35.16 Swiss francs, with the decline offsetting gains from the earnings beat and capital return announcements.</p>
<p>The results reflect the challenges facing global banks in navigating volatile markets while managing multi-year integration projects. UBS&#39;s Credit Suisse integration remains on track for $13 billion in annualized cost savings by 2027, but the US wealth outflows highlight execution risks in key growth markets. Management attributed the outflows to competitive dynamics rather than structural issues, projecting stabilization in coming quarters.</p>
<h3>5. Novo Nordisk Collapses 20% This Week as Weight-Loss Drug Competition Intensifies</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shares of the Danish pharmaceutical giant have lost more than a fifth of their value this week after issuing guidance calling for 5-13% sales decline in 2026, with pricing pressure on Wegovy and competition from low-cost alternatives crushing investor sentiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff began Tuesday after Novo forecast its first annual sales decline in decades, citing significantly lower US pricing on its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy. The new oral Wegovy pill launched at $149 per month—a fraction of the injectable version&#39;s price—but even that proved insufficient as Hims &amp; Hers announced a $49 copycat version, prompting Novo to threaten legal action.</p>
<p>The 17% single-day plunge on Wednesday marked one of the worst sessions in Novo&#39;s history as investors digested the implications of intensifying competition in the weight-loss market. Patent expiries in ex-US markets will further pressure sales, while the US government&#39;s push to cut drug prices adds regulatory headwinds. CEO Mike Doustdar acknowledged the situation &quot;will get worse before it gets better.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, some analysts see opportunity. The Wegovy pill launch exceeded expectations, with 170,000 patients starting treatment in just four weeks. The weight-loss drug market is projected to exceed $150 billion annually by 2030, suggesting ample room for multiple competitors. However, Novo&#39;s premium valuation had priced in continued dominance, and the recalibration of expectations has been painful for shareholders.</p>
<h3>6. Reddit Jumps 13% on Earnings Beat and $1 Billion Buyback Announcement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The social media platform reported Q4 revenue of $725.6 million—up 70% year-over-year and well above expectations—while announcing a $1 billion share repurchase program and projecting continued strong growth from advertising and AI data licensing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reddit delivered earnings of $1.24 per share, crushing analyst estimates of $0.95, with daily active users climbing 19% to 121.4 million. The company&#39;s AI data-licensing agreements with major technology companies have emerged as a significant revenue stream, contributing to margins that exceeded Wall Street expectations. Management indicated advertiser demand and engagement trends have remained steady into Q1.</p>
<p>The stock&#39;s 13% surge stood out in a technology sector still recovering from the week&#39;s volatility. Reddit&#39;s smaller market capitalization and less capital-intensive business model differentiated it from the mega-cap tech companies whose massive AI spending plans have concerned investors. The buyback announcement—a first for the company since its 2024 IPO—signaled management confidence in the stock&#39;s value.</p>
<p>However, the rally came with caveats. Some analysts raised concerns about regulatory scrutiny of Reddit&#39;s AI data deals and the sustainability of licensing revenue as AI companies develop alternative data sources. The stock briefly dipped 8% in early trading before recovering, reflecting the mixed sentiment. Full-year 2026 guidance came in above consensus, supporting the afternoon rally.</p>
<h3>7. Gold Rallies Above $4,950 as Geopolitical Uncertainty Drives Safe-Haven Demand</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gold surged 3.5% to above $4,950 per ounce Friday, recovering from mid-week volatility as lingering geopolitical tensions and signs of US economic softening reinforced the metal&#39;s safe-haven appeal despite equity market gains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The precious metal has risen 11.4% over the past month and 73.5% year-over-year, benefiting from central bank purchases, inflation concerns, and geopolitical uncertainty. Friday&#39;s rally came despite the strong equity performance, suggesting gold is responding to different factors than risk assets. UBS strategists characterized the week&#39;s volatility as &quot;normal within a continuing structural uptrend.&quot;</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs maintained its $5,400 year-end target, citing &quot;significant upside risk&quot; to current forecasts. Central bank purchases have accelerated as nations diversify reserves away from the US dollar, with China, India, and Turkey among the largest buyers. The dual dynamic of institutional demand and retail investment has supported prices even as real interest rates have risen.</p>
<p>The gold rally contrasts sharply with silver, which crashed 36% on January 31 in its worst single-day decline since 1980. The divergence reflects different demand drivers, with gold&#39;s monetary properties providing support while silver&#39;s industrial exposure left it vulnerable to economic slowdown concerns. Analysts expect continued volatility in precious metals as markets navigate conflicting signals from inflation, growth, and geopolitical developments.</p>
<h3>8. Consumer Sentiment Beats Expectations as Inflation Fears Ease</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 57.3 in February—beating the 55.0 consensus estimate—while year-ahead inflation expectations fell to 3.5% from 4%, the lowest reading since January 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The improvement marked the second consecutive monthly increase in sentiment, suggesting households are feeling marginally better about their financial prospects despite persistent concerns about high prices and labor market uncertainty. The 3.5% inflation expectation, while still elevated above the 2.3-3.0% pre-pandemic range, indicates easing anxiety about future price increases.</p>
<p>However, the absolute level of sentiment remains depressed relative to historical norms. The 57.3 reading is down 11.4% from the same period last year, reflecting ongoing pressures on household finances. Consumer spending has remained resilient despite weak sentiment readings, creating a disconnect between how people feel and how they behave—a pattern that has persisted throughout the post-pandemic period.</p>
<p>The data provided modest support for equity markets Friday, though the sentiment improvement was overshadowed by the broader recovery from Thursday&#39;s selloff. Economists noted that the easing inflation expectations could support the Federal Reserve&#39;s patient approach to rate policy, reducing pressure for near-term cuts while keeping the option available if conditions deteriorate.</p>
<h3>9. Oil Prices Volatile as US-Iran Talks Ease Immediate Conflict Fears</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent crude traded around $68 per barrel Friday after swinging sharply through the week, with prices easing on news that US-Iran talks in Oman produced at least temporary diplomatic engagement rather than breakdown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confirmation that negotiations would proceed helped ease near-term concerns over military conflict and supply disruptions involving Iran, which accounts for about 3% of global crude production. However, the talks produced no concrete agreement, leaving the geopolitical risk premium partially in place. Saudi Arabia&#39;s decision to cut prices for its main Asian crude grade to the lowest since late 2020 added to the bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>The oil market is navigating conflicting signals: geopolitical tensions that could disrupt supply versus expectations of 2026 surplus that would pressure prices regardless. OPEC+ has maintained production restraints, but non-OPEC supply growth—particularly from the United States, Brazil, and Guyana—is expected to outpace demand growth. The World Bank projected commodity prices could fall to six-year lows amid the surplus.</p>
<p>For now, prices remain elevated relative to fundamental supply-demand balances, with analysts estimating $7-8 per barrel of geopolitical risk premium. A lasting de-escalation with Iran could bring additional barrels to market while removing that premium—a significant downside risk for prices. Friday&#39;s trading reflected cautious optimism that the worst-case military scenario has become less likely, without conviction that diplomatic resolution is imminent.</p>
<h3>10. Caterpillar Hits All-Time High as AI Data Center Boom Drives Equipment Demand</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shares of the industrial giant surged to a record $723.32 as the company reported strong Q4 results and highlighted its growing role in powering AI data centers, with a 2-gigawatt natural gas generator order for the Monarch Compute Campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caterpillar reported Q4 2025 revenue of $19.1 billion and full-year revenue of $67.6 billion, issuing 2026 guidance targeting sales growth near the top of its 5-7% long-term range. The company&#39;s power and energy division has become an unexpected beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout, as data centers require massive amounts of electricity that often cannot be met by the existing grid. The Monarch order alone represents one of the largest generator commitments in company history.</p>
<p>The stock has appreciated 88% over the past year, with the AI exposure adding a technology-adjacent growth narrative to the traditional cyclical industrial story. Caterpillar&#39;s autonomous mining and construction equipment division reported record backlog, with AI-driven machinery commanding premium pricing. The combination of infrastructure investment, energy transition, and AI compute demand has created a uniquely favorable environment.</p>
<p>Some analysts cautioned about valuation, with the stock trading at 38x forward earnings—well above historical averages for industrial companies. However, bulls argue the AI data center opportunity represents a structural shift that justifies higher multiples. Friday&#39;s 6% gain made Caterpillar one of the session&#39;s best performers, contributing significantly to the Dow&#39;s record-breaking climb above 50,000.</p>

<h2>Geopolitical News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Russia Launches Largest Aerial Assault of 2026 on Ukraine Energy Infrastructure</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia launched 71 missiles and 450 drones against Ukrainian power facilities in the most devastating energy attack of the year, leaving hundreds of thousands without heat during subzero temperatures immediately after a Trump-brokered energy truce expired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attack came just hours after the expiration of a brief pause in strikes on energy infrastructure that both Moscow and Kyiv had agreed to at the request of President Trump. Ukrainian President Zelensky accused Russia of using the pause not for diplomatic purposes but to stockpile missiles, then striking deliberately on the coldest days of the year when temperatures plunged to -20°C across much of the country.</p>
<p>DTEK, Ukraine&#39;s largest private energy provider, described the February 3 assault as &quot;the most severe&quot; since the start of 2026. More than 1,170 high-rise buildings in Kyiv lost heating, while a power plant in Kharkiv was damaged beyond repair, leaving 300,000 residents without electricity. In Odesa, over 50,000 people lost power as temperatures remained dangerously cold.</p>
<p>Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 38 missiles and 412 drones, but the strikes that got through caused catastrophic damage. DTEK&#39;s CEO noted that Ukraine has now lost approximately 70% of its generation capacity, with many civilians receiving only 3-4 hours of electricity daily. The energy crisis has driven an estimated 600,000 people to leave Kyiv since the war began.</p>
<h3>2. SpaceX Blocks Russian Forces&#39; Unauthorized Starlink Access After Ukraine&#39;s Plea</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX deactivated Starlink internet terminals used by Russian military forces in Ukraine after Kyiv provided evidence of &quot;hundreds&quot; of drone attacks guided by the satellite system, with Russian military bloggers confirming widespread outages across the front lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ukraine&#39;s defense ministry launched a verification of all Starlink terminals operating in the country after discovering that Moscow troops had been mounting Starlink systems on attack drones to strike deeper into Ukrainian territory. The unauthorized use began in September 2024, with the Rubikon company equipping Molniya strike drones with Starlink systems starting December 2025.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials created a &quot;white list&quot; of verified Starlink terminals used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and sent them to SpaceX, requesting that Musk keep these operational while shutting down all others in the theater. Pro-Russian military bloggers confirmed sweeping outages that weakened Moscow&#39;s ability to wage drone warfare and hindered coordination between units.</p>
<p>Musk responded on X that SpaceX&#39;s efforts to halt &quot;unauthorized&quot; Russian use appeared successful, posting &quot;Let us know if more needs to be done.&quot; The Ukrainian Defense Ministry confirmed that Russian terminals had been &quot;cut off,&quot; representing a significant blow to Russia&#39;s drone warfare capabilities just as it launched its largest aerial assault of the year.</p>
<h3>3. US-India Announce Landmark Trade Deal, Reducing Tariffs from 50% to 18%</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump announced a breakthrough trade agreement with India, immediately reducing tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% after Prime Minister Modi agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and commit to over $500 billion in American purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deal ended a year-long tariff standoff between the two nations, with Trump also dropping the separate 25% tariff imposed over India&#39;s Russian oil imports. Under the agreement, India pledged to eliminate tariffs on American industrial goods while being allowed to maintain protections for its agricultural sector. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal called it &quot;the father of all deals.&quot;</p>
<p>Indian markets surged on the news, with the Nifty 50 jumping nearly 5% and the rupee strengthening to 90.40—its best day since November 2022. Twenty-seven of 30 Sensex stocks traded positive as trade war fears eased. The 18% US tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors in the battle for American market access.</p>
<p>However, analysts cautioned that legally binding text has yet to materialize. Prime Minister Modi notably did not mention the Russian oil commitment or tariff elimination in his public response to Trump&#39;s announcement, raising questions about how the deal will be implemented and whether it can withstand political scrutiny in both countries.</p>
<h3>4. Australia and Indonesia Sign Historic Security Treaty for Defense Cooperation</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Australia and Indonesia signed a comprehensive security treaty establishing new military training facilities and closer defense cooperation, as Southeast Asia&#39;s largest economy aligns more closely with its southern neighbor amid rising great power competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed the agreement as &quot;a historic moment in our nations&#39; relationship,&quot; building upon a 2024 defense pact that pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region. The treaty creates a framework for joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and the development of training facilities in Indonesian territory.</p>
<p>The agreement comes as both nations navigate increasingly complex security dynamics, with China&#39;s military assertiveness in the South China Sea and the shifting priorities of the United States under President Trump creating pressure for regional powers to strengthen bilateral ties. Indonesia&#39;s strategic location straddling major shipping lanes makes the partnership particularly significant.</p>
<p>The treaty represents a significant warming of relations that were strained in previous decades over issues including East Timor and asylum seekers. Defense analysts note the agreement signals Indonesia&#39;s willingness to engage more deeply with traditional Western security partners while maintaining its non-aligned foreign policy stance, balancing relationships with both Washington and Beijing.</p>
<h3>5. Trump Administration Moves to Strip Job Protections from 50,000 Federal Workers</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management issued a final rule creating a new employment classification that will remove civil service protections from an estimated 50,000 &quot;policy-influencing&quot; federal employees, making them at-will workers who can be fired at the president&#39;s discretion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the &quot;Schedule Policy/Career&quot; classification, reclassified employees will lose the ability to appeal disciplinary actions, suspensions, demotions, or firings to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Starting March 9, these employees could be converted to at-will status at Trump&#39;s discretion, representing the most significant restructuring of federal employment since the civil service system was established.</p>
<p>The proposal received over 40,000 public comments during its 45-day comment period, with approximately 94% opposing the regulation. Unions representing federal workers condemned the move as an attempt to politicize the civil service and create a workforce loyal to the president rather than to their professional responsibilities and the public interest.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management data shows that 242,260 employees have left the federal workforce—voluntarily or involuntarily—since Trump took office for his second term. Combined with the earlier DOGE initiative that reduced the federal civilian workforce by 9% in 2025, the administration has achieved the most dramatic reduction in government employment since World War II.</p>
<h3>6. Xi Jinping and Trump Hold Phone Call, Discussing Taiwan and Trade Ahead of Summit</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Xi Jinping emphasized that Taiwan is &quot;the most important issue in China-U.S. relations&quot; during a phone call with President Trump, as the two leaders discussed trade tensions and geopolitical flashpoints ahead of a planned face-to-face meeting in April.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The call came after Xi held a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Putin confirmed plans to visit China in the first half of 2026. The timing highlighted Beijing&#39;s careful balancing act between maintaining its strategic partnership with Moscow while managing the increasingly complex relationship with Washington under Trump&#39;s trade-focused foreign policy.</p>
<p>Xi noted that over the past year the two countries have enjoyed sound communication following their successful meeting in Busan, which charted the direction for China-U.S. relations. However, he made clear that Taiwan remains a red line, declaring that &quot;Taiwan is China&#39;s territory&quot; and any American actions regarding the island could fundamentally damage bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The planned April summit will be closely watched for signs of progress on trade issues, particularly as Trump&#39;s tariff threats against allies and adversaries alike have created uncertainty in global markets. Western leaders including Canada&#39;s Prime Minister Mark Carney, the UK&#39;s Keir Starmer, and Germany&#39;s Friedrich Merz have all visited or plan to visit Beijing, reflecting China&#39;s central role in global economic and security calculations.</p>
<h3>7. ASEAN Refuses to Recognize Myanmar&#39;s Junta-Led Elections</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations issued a formal statement rejecting the legitimacy of elections held in Myanmar, marking a significant escalation in regional pressure on the military junta as the country approaches five years since the February 2021 coup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The elections, held in December 2025 and January 2026, were designed to provide a &quot;controlled veneer of legitimacy&quot; for the military government, according to analysts. However, the junta remains unable to assert full authority across the country, with resistance forces controlling significant territory and ongoing armed conflict preventing voting in many regions.</p>
<p>Myanmar, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, remains among the countries most susceptible to major civil unrest in Asia through 2026, according to intelligence assessments. Economic hardship, inflation, and widespread corruption continue to fuel protests, while armed resistance groups have made significant territorial gains against the military.</p>
<p>The media landscape in Myanmar continues to deteriorate as the nation approaches the fifth anniversary of the coup. New legislation across South Korea, Australia, and Indonesia affecting press freedom has drawn regional attention, while journalists in Myanmar face ongoing persecution, arbitrary detention, and violence for reporting on the conflict.</p>
<h3>8. Bangladesh Heads to Polls After Two Years of Political Upheaval</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bangladeshis are set to vote on February 12 in national elections that will determine the country&#39;s direction nearly two years after the July Uprising of 2024 that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a violent popular revolt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Islamic conservative party Jamaat-e-Islami announced it would maintain &quot;constructive and cooperative&quot; relations with neighboring countries including India as part of its election platform. The party&#39;s outreach to New Delhi represents an attempt to reassure regional powers concerned about political instability in the densely populated nation of 170 million.</p>
<p>The elections come amid continued civil unrest that intelligence analysts predict will persist into 2026. Economic hardship, inflation, and public anger over widespread corruption drove the protests that toppled Hasina&#39;s government, and these underlying conditions remain largely unaddressed nearly two years later.</p>
<p>Bangladesh&#39;s relationship with India has been strained since the 2024 uprising, with concerns in New Delhi about the treatment of Hindu minorities and the rise of Islamic political movements. The election results will significantly impact India&#39;s eastern security calculus and the broader dynamics of South Asian geopolitics.</p>
<h3>9. Trump Abandons Greenland Tariff Threats After European Backlash</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump canceled threatened tariffs on eight European nations that were scheduled to take effect on February 1, backing away from his demand that Denmark sell Greenland to the United States after the crisis sparked a significant deterioration in European public opinion of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump had initially announced a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, with threats to increase duties to 25% by June 1 unless Denmark agreed to cede Greenland. At the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, Trump reversed his position, pledging not to use force or tariffs to acquire the autonomous territory.</p>
<p>The crisis prompted Denmark to deploy hundreds of elite combat soldiers trained in arctic warfare to Greenland, including the Chief of the Royal Danish Army. A YouGov poll from February 2026 showed the standoff led to a significant increase in unfavorable views of the United States across Western Europe, potentially complicating future diplomatic initiatives.</p>
<p>Despite the de-escalation, Trump&#39;s broader tariff agenda continues to reshape transatlantic relations. The administration maintains 10% tariffs on European goods that took effect February 1 under separate trade disputes, with threats of further escalation if trade imbalances are not addressed to Washington&#39;s satisfaction.</p>
<h3>10. Ethiopia and Kenya Launch Joint Defense Committee Amid Regional Security Cooperation</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethiopia and Kenya concluded the inaugural meeting of their Joint Defence Committee, institutionalizing bilateral defense cooperation as the two nations emerge as primary drivers of East Africa&#39;s economic and security architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three-day meeting in Nairobi followed the signing of a Defense Cooperation Agreement that established a framework for coordinating military relations between the neighboring countries. The partnership aims to address shared security threats including terrorism, border instability, and the spillover effects of conflicts in Somalia and Sudan.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is positioning itself as Africa&#39;s &quot;green powerhouse,&quot; generating over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources through decades of investment in hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal infrastructure. Surplus electricity from large hydropower stations is increasingly exported to Kenya and Sudan under regional power trade agreements, strengthening economic interdependence.</p>
<p>The UN projects Ethiopia and Kenya will be the main drivers of East Africa&#39;s economic expansion in 2026, with the region&#39;s economy expected to grow by 5.8%—up from 5.4% in 2025—outperforming all other African sub-regions. This economic dynamism is enabling both countries to invest more heavily in defense and regional security initiatives.</p>
<h3>11. DRC Peace Process Launched with Former African Leaders as Facilitators</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>African nations appointed former Kenya president Uhuru Kenyatta, former Ethiopia prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and former Nigeria president Olusegun Obasanjo as facilitators of a new peace process for the Democratic Republic of Congo, as fighting continues in the mineral-rich east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appointment of the elder statesmen comes as Rwanda&#39;s President Kagame continues to defy international pressure over the DRC conflict, with the M23 rebel group—widely understood to receive Rwandan backing—controlling significant territory including the Rubaya coltan mines that produce 15% of the world&#39;s supply of the critical mineral used in electronics.</p>
<p>Kenya faces its own humanitarian crisis as a deepening drought pushes pastoralist families to the brink, with livestock losses spreading across the arid north. The dual crises of conflict in the DRC and climate-related disasters across the Horn of Africa are straining regional resources and diplomatic bandwidth.</p>
<p>The new peace process faces significant obstacles, as previous initiatives have failed to address the fundamental drivers of conflict: control over mineral wealth, ethnic tensions, and the competing interests of regional powers. The facilitators must navigate these challenges while managing pressure from Western nations and China, both of which have significant economic interests in the DRC&#39;s mineral sector.</p>
<h3>12. Super Bowl LX Set for Sunday as Seahawks Face Patriots in Epic Rematch</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare to face off at Levi&#39;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday in a Super Bowl rematch of their legendary 2015 clash, with both teams having finished the season at 14-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NFL Honors ceremony on Thursday announced Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford as the league&#39;s Most Valuable Player, while the 2026 Hall of Fame class was revealed: Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly, Adam Vinatieri, and Roger Craig. The class includes three of the NFL&#39;s all-time greats at their positions.</p>
<p>Seattle enters as 4.5-point favorites, with quarterback Sam Darnold and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba leading an explosive offense. Bad Bunny will headline the halftime show, with Charlie Puth performing the national anthem and Green Day opening the ceremony. Brandi Carlile will sing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and Coco Jones will perform &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing.&quot;</p>
<p>The game carries enormous stakes for both franchises. A Seahawks victory would help erase the bitter memory of Malcolm Butler&#39;s game-winning interception at the goal line in Super Bowl XLIX. For New England, a win would mark the Patriots&#39; seventh championship and validate the team&#39;s complete rebuild since Tom Brady&#39;s departure.</p>
<h3>13. European Leaders Face Mounting Unpopularity as Reform Agendas Stall</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>France, Germany, and the United Kingdom entered 2026 with historically unpopular governments, with polling showing just 18% of Britons viewing Keir Starmer favorably and only 16% of French respondents holding a positive view of Emmanuel Macron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Germany&#39;s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in May 2025 after February&#39;s snap election, began his term with just 38% approval—which had fallen to 32% by December. His coalition faces pressure from five upcoming state elections where the far-right Alternative for Germany is expected to gain seats, limiting his ability to pursue controversial reforms.</p>
<p>France entered 2026 for the second consecutive year without an approved budget after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu&#39;s minority government collapsed under pressure from both left and right. A new budget agreement is expected by late February or March, but the political paralysis has limited the government&#39;s ability to respond to economic challenges or the Trump administration&#39;s trade demands.</p>
<p>In the UK, domestic pressure grows on Starmer to pursue closer economic integration with the European Union, including potentially joining the customs union. However, official talks between London and Brussels have gone nowhere, leaving Britain isolated between an uninterested Europe and a Trump administration focused on bilateral trade confrontation.</p>
<h3>14. Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana to Lead Latin American Oil Production Surge</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latin America&#39;s three emerging oil powers—Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana—are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing a potential 300,000 bpd contribution from Venezuela as the region reshapes global energy markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brazil leads the surge, with production expected to exceed 4.2 million barrels per day this year. The increase is specifically linked to ramp-ups and start-ups of new floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels in the country&#39;s prolific pre-salt offshore fields. Petrobras and international partners continue to invest heavily in the deep-water Santos and Campos basins.</p>
<p>Argentina&#39;s shale revolution is accelerating, with investment in the Vaca Muerta formation expected to drive Latin American shale sector spending to nearly $11 billion in 2026, up from $9.4 billion in 2025. The country&#39;s vast unconventional resources are attracting international capital despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges.</p>
<p>Despite sanctions relief, Venezuela&#39;s oil output is projected to lag regional competitors through 2030. Years of underinvestment, mismanagement, and the departure of international partners have left the country&#39;s once-mighty oil industry struggling to ramp production, even as global demand and prices create incentives for increased output.</p>
<h3>15. India Assumes BRICS Presidency, Pushes Local Currency Trade Agenda</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>India took over the BRICS chairship for the fourth time with a focus on &quot;Building for Resilience, Innovation, Cooperation and Sustainability,&quot; promoting trade in local currencies while carefully distancing itself from proposals for a common BRICS currency that have raised concerns in Washington.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Modi announced he would give &quot;a new form&quot; to BRICS during India&#39;s tenure, emphasizing policy coordination, development finance, trade facilitation, and reform of global institutional governance. India&#39;s Rupee-Rouble trade with Russia is estimated to now account for over 90% of bilateral commerce, demonstrating the growing viability of de-dollarized transactions.</p>
<p>India&#39;s BRICS presidency gains particular significance amid global geopolitical turbulence, with New Delhi navigating complex relationships with both the United States—following the landmark trade deal announced on February 2—and its traditional strategic partner Russia. The balancing act requires careful diplomacy as Washington increases pressure on nations to reduce ties with Moscow.</p>
<p>The expanded BRICS+ grouping now includes Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Iran, creating a coalition that represents a significant share of global population, GDP, and energy production. India&#39;s leadership will be tested by managing diverse interests within the group while advancing its own strategic objectives in an increasingly multipolar world.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Alphabet Announces $185 Billion AI Spending Plan, Doubling 2025 Investment</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&#39;s parent company reported record fourth-quarter earnings while projecting capital expenditures of up to $185 billion for 2026—more than double its $91.4 billion spend in 2025—as CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the &quot;staggering&quot; scale of AI infrastructure investment is keeping him up at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alphabet beat Wall Street expectations, reporting earnings per share of $2.82 versus $2.63 estimated and revenue of $113.83 billion versus $111.43 billion expected. The company&#39;s annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time, with net income growing 15% to $132.2 billion. Google Cloud revenues surged 48% to $17.7 billion, driven by enterprise AI solutions.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter. Alphabet achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations and efficiency improvements. Pichai emphasized that AI is driving Search revenue growth as users engage with Google&#39;s AI mode features.</p>
<p>Despite the strong earnings, shares traded flat as investors weighed the massive spending commitment. The $185 billion guidance represents the largest capital expenditure plan ever announced by a technology company, raising questions about returns on AI infrastructure investment even as competitors race to match Alphabet&#39;s spending.</p>
<h3>2. Waymo Raises $16 Billion at $126 Billion Valuation, Plans Global Robotaxi Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alphabet&#39;s autonomous driving unit secured the largest investment ever in an autonomous vehicle company, with Dragoneer, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital leading a round that values Waymo at $126 billion—more than double its valuation from the October 2024 funding round.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The investor roster reads like a who&#39;s who of Silicon Valley: Andreessen Horowitz, Mubadala Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, T. Rowe Price, BDT &amp; MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek all participated. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.</p>
<p>Waymo plans to use the capital to expand to over 20 new cities in 2026, including its first international markets. Tokyo and London are confirmed as the company&#39;s initial overseas destinations, marking a significant milestone in the global deployment of autonomous vehicle technology. The expansion will require substantial investment in local regulatory approvals, mapping, and support infrastructure.</p>
<p>The massive valuation reflects investor confidence in Waymo&#39;s technological lead over competitors following General Motors&#39; decision to shut down its Cruise robotaxi unit. With Tesla still struggling to deliver on autonomous driving promises and Chinese competitors facing geopolitical headwinds, Waymo appears positioned to capture the lion&#39;s share of the emerging robotaxi market.</p>
<h3>3. Big Tech AI Spending Approaches $700 Billion as Hyperscalers Double Down</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The four major cloud hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—announced combined 2026 capital expenditure plans approaching $700 billion, up from $350 billion in 2025, as the AI infrastructure arms race enters a new phase of intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta intends to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion in capex for 2026, joining Alphabet&#39;s $175-185 billion commitment. Microsoft and Amazon are also scaling investments dramatically, though exact figures vary. The spending surge reflects fierce competition to secure GPU capacity from Nvidia and build data center infrastructure capable of training and serving increasingly powerful AI models.</p>
<p>Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion this year through debt and equity financing to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity for its largest customers including AMD and Meta. The company is selling $25 billion in investment-grade bonds as part of the effort, highlighting how the AI boom is reshaping corporate finance across the technology sector.</p>
<p>The massive spending is taking a significant toll on cash reserves. Analysts note that while revenue growth remains strong, free cash flow is being consumed by infrastructure investment at an unprecedented rate. The question of whether this spending will generate adequate returns remains the central uncertainty for technology investors.</p>
<h3>4. Disney Experiences Division Crosses $10 Billion in Quarterly Revenue for First Time</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney Company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates, with its theme parks, resorts, and cruises division posting record revenue, though shares fell 7% after investors focused on slowing streaming growth and succession uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall revenue for the quarter was roughly $26 billion, up 5% year over year, with the experiences division generating $10 billion for the first time in history. Domestic theme parks recorded $6.91 billion in revenue while international parks reported $1.75 billion—each up 7% compared with the prior-year period. The cruise line expansion is contributing increasingly to the segment&#39;s performance.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter was $2.48 billion, or $1.34 per share, down from $2.64 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items including tax charges related to a deal with Fubo, Disney reported $1.63 in earnings per share, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.58.</p>
<p>Despite the strong operational performance, Disney shares came under pressure as investors digested news about CEO Bob Iger&#39;s succession timeline. The company reaffirmed its plan to repurchase $7 billion in stock for fiscal 2026, projected double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and expects $19 billion in cash provided by operations—but questions about leadership transition overshadowed the results.</p>
<h3>5. Tesla Reports First-Ever Annual Revenue Decline as Musk Pivots to AI and Robotics</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tesla reported 2025 full-year revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3% from $97.7 billion the previous year—the first annual decline in the electric vehicle maker&#39;s history—as CEO Elon Musk announced plans to end Model S and Model X production to make room for Optimus humanoid robots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations with adjusted EPS of 50 cents versus 45 cents estimated on revenue of $24.90 billion. However, net profit fell 61% to $840 million for the quarter, bringing full-year profit to $3.8 billion—down sharply from $7.1 billion in 2024. The margin compression reflects intensified price competition in the global EV market.</p>
<p>During the earnings call, Musk outlined a dramatic strategic transformation: Tesla will transition from an EV manufacturer to &quot;a full-blown real-world AI and robotics company.&quot; Model S and Model X production will end in Q2 2026, with Fremont factory space converted to manufacture Optimus humanoid robots. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said investors should expect approximately $20 billion in capital expenditure for 2026.</p>
<p>Musk claimed Tesla&#39;s robotaxi service has been &quot;rolled out in a few cities&quot; and will be &quot;very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US.&quot; The bold prediction drew skepticism from analysts who noted regulatory hurdles and the company&#39;s history of missed autonomous driving timelines. Wall Street&#39;s median year-end target implies roughly 10% upside from current levels.</p>
<h3>6. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Earnings as Weight Loss Drug Demand Soars</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pharmaceutical giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, crushing Wall Street expectations as blockbuster demand for weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro drives unprecedented revenue growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly guided to 2026 revenue between $80 billion and $83 billion, dramatically exceeding analyst expectations of $77.62 billion. The company projects adjusted earnings between $33.50 and $35 per share, compared with the $33.23 consensus estimate. The guidance implies continued market share gains in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 drug category.</p>
<p>The earnings report contrasted sharply with Novo Nordisk&#39;s struggles earlier in the week, as Lilly appeared to be winning the competitive battle for weight loss drug market share. Production capacity investments are paying off, allowing Lilly to meet surging demand while Novo Nordisk faces supply constraints that have limited its growth.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s success reflects broader transformation in the pharmaceutical industry, as GLP-1 drugs emerge as potentially the largest drug class in history. Beyond obesity and diabetes, trials are exploring applications in cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other conditions—expanding the total addressable market beyond current analyst models.</p>
<h3>7. Pfizer Beats Estimates Despite Declining COVID Revenue, Reaffirms Modest Outlook</h3>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pfizer reported fourth-quarter results that topped analyst expectations even as demand for its COVID-19 products continued to decline, while reaffirming a 2026 outlook that projects essentially flat revenue compared to 2025 levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company expects 2026 adjusted profit between $2.80 and $3.00 per share, with revenue totaling $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. The guidance reflects the challenges of managing a post-pandemic portfolio as COVID vaccine and treatment revenues fade while the company works to develop new growth drivers.</p>
<p>Pfizer&#39;s results stand in stark contrast to the explosive growth reported by competitors like Eli Lilly, highlighting the divergent fortunes of pharmaceutical companies depending on their exposure to the GLP-1 weight loss drug category. Pfizer&#39;s attempts to enter the obesity market have faced setbacks, leaving the company without a clear path to matching rivals&#39; growth rates.</p>
<p>The company continues to invest in its oncology pipeline and other therapeutic areas, but investors remain skeptical about the timeline for meaningful revenue contributions. The modest guidance keeps Pfizer in a transition period as it seeks to replace pandemic-era profits with sustainable new product revenues.</p>
<h3>8. Mortgage Rates Fall to Three-Year Lows as Housing Activity Improves</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.11%, the lowest level in more than three years, driving a surge in purchase applications and refinance activity as the spring selling season approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freddie Mac reported the 15-year fixed mortgage averaged 5.50%, while some lenders offered rates below 6% for well-qualified borrowers. The decline followed the Federal Reserve&#39;s decision to hold rates steady while signaling openness to future cuts. Analysts at Morgan Stanley project rates could hit 5.75% later this year if inflation continues to moderate.</p>
<p>Purchase and refinance applications have jumped year-over-year as lower rates create opportunities for both first-time buyers and existing homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments. Mortgage industry experts note that housing activity &quot;is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season&quot; after two years of elevated rate headwinds.</p>
<p>A recent analysis revealed that a surprising share of homeowners still carry mortgage rates above 5%, creating significant refinance demand as rates decline. The combination of pent-up buyer demand, falling rates, and limited inventory could produce competitive spring housing markets despite affordability challenges persisting in many metropolitan areas.</p>
<h3>9. CFPB Secures Emergency Funding Through March After Court Rejects Shutdown Attempt</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau obtained $145 million in emergency funding from the Federal Reserve after a federal judge ruled in December that the Trump administration cannot close a congressionally-created agency without an act of Congress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acting Director Russell Vought had attempted to effectively shut down the CFPB in February 2025 by ordering staff to stop work on proposed rules, suspend finalized regulations, halt investigations, and cease supervision and examination activities. Most staff were placed on administrative leave as the administration sought to eliminate the consumer watchdog agency.</p>
<p>The December 30, 2025 court ruling rejected Vought&#39;s argument that he could unilaterally close the agency, ordering the CFPB to remain funded and operational. The $145 million transfer from the Federal Reserve Board will allow the agency to continue operations through at least March 2026, though its long-term future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy groups have warned that the ongoing attempts to neutralize the CFPB leave Americans more vulnerable to predatory lending, debt collection abuses, and financial fraud. Industry groups have welcomed the reduced regulatory oversight, arguing the agency exceeded its statutory authority under previous leadership.</p>
<h3>10. GM Projects $4 Billion in Tariff Costs for 2026 Despite Increased US Production</h3>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>General Motors announced plans to top Ford in US vehicle production while warning that tariff costs will reach between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2026, highlighting the significant financial burden of trade policy on American automakers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CEO Mary Barra outlined the production targets as part of the company&#39;s 2025 earnings report and 2026 guidance. The expansion of domestic manufacturing is partly designed to mitigate tariff exposure, but vehicles and components that cross borders multiple times during production still face significant duties under current trade policies.</p>
<p>The tariff burden comes as GM navigates the costly transition to electric vehicles while maintaining profitability in its traditional internal combustion engine business. The company must balance investment in next-generation technology against the headwinds of trade policy and increasingly competitive global EV markets.</p>
<p>Ford is scheduled to report earnings on February 10 and is expected to face similar tariff challenges. Both Detroit automakers have warned that tariff costs are being passed along to consumers through higher vehicle prices, contributing to affordability challenges that have dampened new car demand despite strong consumer interest.</p>
<h3>11. Semiconductor Industry Enters 2nm Manufacturing Race as AI Demand Strains Supply</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TSMC&#39;s 2nm process entered mass production with strong yields as the company battles Samsung and Intel for AI chip supremacy, with Apple reportedly exploring alternative foundries as capacity constraints force diversification of the global semiconductor supply chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TSMC sees its AI revenue growing at a mid- to high-50% compound annual growth rate through 2029, with Nvidia now surpassing Apple as the company&#39;s largest customer. Capacity is expected to ramp faster in 2026 driven by smartphones, high-performance computing, and AI applications, but demand continues to outpace supply.</p>
<p>Intel&#39;s 18A node has allowed the American chipmaker to regain technical parity with TSMC by some metrics, featuring power delivery innovation that TSMC does not expect to match until late 2026. Samsung&#39;s SF2 node offers unique design flexibility, enabling engineers to optimize for either ultra-low-power mobile chips or high-performance AI accelerators.</p>
<p>The computer microchip market is projected to grow from $26.43 billion in 2025 to $29.1 billion in 2026, with a compound annual growth rate of 10.1%. Intel and Samsung have both commenced the transition from organic resin substrates to glass to meet the thermal and interconnect demands of generative AI, signaling the next phase of manufacturing innovation.</p>
<h3>12. Saudi Arabia in Talks with Boeing and Airbus for Historic Aircraft Order</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saudi Arabia&#39;s flagship carrier Saudia is negotiating with both Boeing and Airbus for what could be its largest plane purchase ever, seeking at least 150 narrowbody and widebody jets as the kingdom invests billions to become a global travel and tourism hub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The potential order reflects Saudi Arabia&#39;s Vision 2030 initiative, which aims to diversify the economy away from oil dependence through massive investment in tourism, entertainment, and aviation infrastructure. The kingdom is developing new airports and expanding existing facilities to accommodate ambitious passenger growth targets.</p>
<p>Both Boeing and Airbus are positioning for the deal as they work to increase production rates significantly in 2026. Industry analysts project deliveries of 1,044 aircraft for Airbus and 708 for Boeing this year, rising to 1,188 and 870 respectively in 2027. Combined backlogs exceed 11 years, giving airlines limited alternatives for new aircraft.</p>
<p>Boeing has advanced the 737 Max 10 into the second phase of FAA flight testing, moving closer to certification of the stretched variant that would compete for narrowbody orders. The company is recovering from production challenges and regulatory scrutiny, while Airbus faces its own capacity constraints in meeting surging global demand.</p>
<h3>13. Netflix Guides to $51 Billion Revenue as Ad Business Set to Double</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Netflix projected 2026 revenue between $50.7 billion and $51.7 billion, with advertising revenue expected to roughly double compared to 2025 as the streaming giant&#39;s ad-supported tier gains momentum in its second year of operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share came in at 56 cents versus 55 cents estimated, with revenue of $12.05 billion versus $11.97 billion expected. Revenue during the period rose 18% year over year, driven by membership growth, higher subscription pricing, and increased advertising revenue from the tier launched in late 2024.</p>
<p>The company reported 325 million global subscribers, continuing its position as the world&#39;s largest streaming service despite intensifying competition. Password-sharing crackdowns implemented in 2024 have contributed to subscriber growth, while the ad-supported tier has attracted price-sensitive consumers who might otherwise have canceled.</p>
<p>Spotify also raised prices in February, increasing its Individual Premium plan from $11.99 to $12.99 per month. The price hike is expected to serve as a tailwind for earnings reports in the first and second quarters of 2026, as streaming services across audio and video demonstrate pricing power despite consumer concerns about subscription fatigue.</p>
<h3>14. Fintech and Homebuilders Emerge as Midterm Election Trades</h3>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wall Street is positioning for the November midterm elections, with investors eyeing trades that would benefit from Trump administration efforts to lower the cost of living—particularly fintech firms and homebuilders that would see tailwinds if mortgage rates continue to decline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The election-focused positioning comes as markets navigate heightened volatility driven by tariff uncertainty, AI spending concerns, and geopolitical tensions. With nine months until Americans vote for Congress, traders are gaming out scenarios where policy shifts could create sector-specific opportunities.</p>
<p>Homebuilders have attracted attention as mortgage rates fall to three-year lows, potentially unlocking pent-up housing demand. The sector&#39;s performance is closely tied to interest rate trajectory and consumer confidence—both of which could be influenced by the political environment and economic policy heading into the election.</p>
<p>Fintech companies that facilitate lower-cost financial services could benefit from an administration focused on reducing living costs. Payment processors, digital banks, and mortgage technology platforms are being evaluated for their exposure to potential regulatory tailwinds and consumer demand for affordable financial products.</p>
<h3>15. US Manufacturing Expands for First Time in 12 Months as New Orders Surge</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ISM Manufacturing Index showed factory activity expanding in January for the first time in a year, with surges in new orders and production signaling potential economic resilience despite ongoing tariff uncertainty and elevated interest rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expansion ended the longest manufacturing contraction streak since the 2008 financial crisis, suggesting that industrial activity may be turning a corner. Transport stocks hit new all-time highs with the Dow Jones Transportation Average up 2%, led by United Airlines, Old Dominion, and Delta Air Lines.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs expects the US to substantially outperform global growth forecasts—projecting 2.6% GDP growth versus the 2.0% consensus—due to reduced tariff drag, tax cuts, and easier financial conditions. The manufacturing rebound reinforces the bullish thesis that the economy can achieve a soft landing despite 18 months of restrictive monetary policy.</p>
<p>The sector rotation away from growth stocks reflects geopolitical turbulence driving commodity prices and defensive positioning. Energy led January sector performance at 14.37%, followed by materials and consumer staples. Health care, information technology, and financials ended January lower as investors reassessed growth expectations and valuation levels.</p>

<h2>Fusion Energy</h2>
<h3>General Fusion Sets World Record with 600 Million Neutrons Per Second - <em>Jan 28, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Canadian company General Fusion achieves highest neutron output ever recorded for Magnetized Target Fusion, validated by IAEA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion, a Canadian company specializing in nuclear fusion technology, has set a world record by generating 600 million neutrons per second using Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF). This achievement was recognized and validated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and represents a crucial step toward demonstrating the viability of nuclear fusion as a sustainable and scalable energy source.</p>
<p>During compression, the plasma density rose to about 190 times the starting value and the magnetic field that holds it in place grew more than 13 times stronger, while the plasma stayed stable instead of tearing itself apart and delivered repeatable bursts of fusion neutrons. What sets General Fusion&#39;s method apart from traditional fusion techniques is its unique approach involving a liquid metal liner, where high-powered pistons compress the liquid metal mechanically, rapidly compressing plasma within a spherical tokamak.</p>
<p>Dr. Michel Laberge, founder and Chief Scientist of General Fusion, stated: &quot;This is the first-ever compression of a spherical tokamak using a collapsing metal liner. These results strengthen MTF as a viable path to commercial fusion energy.&quot; The results come from the long-running Plasma Compression Science experiment series, whose data have been reviewed by independent scientists and published in the journal Nuclear Fusion. The lessons from these experiments feed directly into Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), the larger demonstration device the company has built in Richmond, British Columbia.</p>
<h3>General Fusion Announces $1 Billion SPAC Merger, First Pure-Play Fusion IPO - <em>Feb 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General Fusion becomes first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion through SPAC deal, signaling growing investor confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion is set to become the first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion, signaling growing investor confidence in the field. The company has agreed to merge with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. III in a roughly $1 billion SPAC deal announced January 21, 2026.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s piston-driven, liquid-lithium approach challenges magnet- and laser-based fusion designs while aiming to reduce material degradation. Instead of using powerful magnets or lasers, the model uses mechanical pistons to contain plasma within a liquid lithium shell, offering a potentially more practical path to commercial fusion power.</p>
<p>This IPO represents a watershed moment for the fusion industry, which has collectively raised over $7.1 billion to date. Commonwealth Fusion Systems leads funding at nearly $3 billion following its $863 million Series B2 in August 2025, but General Fusion&#39;s public offering opens a new avenue for retail and institutional investors to participate in the fusion energy revolution.</p>
<h3>China&#39;s EAST Tokamak Achieves &quot;Density-Free Regime&quot; Breakthrough - <em>Jan 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese scientists break through the long-theorized plasma density limit, removing a major obstacle toward fusion ignition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists working with China&#39;s fully superconducting Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) have successfully reached a long-theorized &quot;density-free regime&quot; in fusion plasma experiments. In this groundbreaking state, the plasma remains stable even when its density rises far beyond traditional limits that have constrained tokamak operations for decades.</p>
<p>The experiment, published in Science Advances, confirmed that plasma can remain stable even at extreme densities if its interaction with the reactor walls is carefully controlled. This finding effectively removes the Greenwald density limit, a major obstacle that has slowed progress toward practical fusion energy generation for years. Using a newly developed high-density operating approach on EAST, the team showed that plasma density can be pushed well beyond long-accepted empirical limits without triggering violent instabilities.</p>
<p>The breakthrough demonstrates that with proper wall conditioning and plasma control techniques, tokamaks can operate at much higher performance levels than previously thought possible, bringing commercial fusion power closer to reality. This research could fundamentally change how future fusion reactors are designed and operated.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan Strategic Fusion Partnership Launched - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering establish collaboration to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate commercialization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering launched a strategic partnership to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate deployment of commercial fusion power. The agreement could serve as a model for joint public-private investment and international collaboration to develop fusion technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Collaboration between U.S. and U.K. research teams has already yielded crucial findings. Both machines confirmed that energy confinement scales more favorably to the expected operating regime in fusion pilot plants in spherical tokamaks than in conventional designs—a finding that could determine the shape of future commercial fusion plants.</p>
<p>This international cooperation reflects growing recognition that fusion energy development benefits from shared resources and expertise across borders. With multiple countries racing toward commercial fusion, partnerships like this one help distribute both the costs and the knowledge gained from cutting-edge experiments.</p>

<h2>Human Genetics &amp; Gene Science</h2>
<h3>First Patient Dosed with CRISPR Epigenetic Silencer for Hepatitis B - <em>Jan 30, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio begins Phase 1/2 trial of CRMA-1001, a CRISPR-derived therapy that silences hepatitis B virus without cutting the genome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio has dosed the first patient with CRMA-1001, an innovative CRISPR-Cas–derived epigenetic silencer designed to treat chronic hepatitis B infection. Unlike traditional gene editing, this therapy methylates viral DNA without making cuts to the genome, representing a fundamentally new approach to treating viral diseases.</p>
<p>The open-label Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and antiviral durability of the treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Regulatory approvals have enabled the study to expand to the UK and New Zealand, broadening the international scope of this promising research. CRMA-1001 specifically targets HBV cccDNA and integrated viral DNA, aiming to achieve a functional cure by silencing the virus&#39;s ability to replicate.</p>
<p>This represents a new paradigm in treating viral infections, using precision epigenetic tools to silence viral genes while leaving the host genome intact. With approximately 296 million people living with chronic hepatitis B worldwide, a functional cure could transform global public health outcomes for this persistent viral infection.</p>
<h3>CRISPR Breakthrough: Turning Genes On Without Cutting DNA - <em>Jan 4, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists develop safer gene therapy approach using epigenetic editing to reactivate silenced genes without making permanent cuts to DNA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists at UNSW Sydney have developed a revolutionary new form of CRISPR technology that can turn genes back on without cutting DNA. Instead of making permanent edits to the genetic code, this approach removes chemical tags (methyl groups) that act like molecular anchors, silencing genes.</p>
<p>The work confirms that these epigenetic tags actively silence genes, settling a long-running scientific debate in the field. Rather than cutting DNA, the new technique uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups, releasing the genetic brakes that keep certain genes switched off. One key target is the fetal globin gene, which helps deliver oxygen before birth.</p>
<p>Reactivating the fetal globin gene after birth could help bypass defects in the adult globin gene that cause Sickle Cell disease. Scientists say this breakthrough opens the door to powerful new therapies with fewer unintended side effects, potentially transforming the gene therapy landscape and making treatments accessible to more patients who currently have limited options.</p>
<h3>Personalized CRISPR Therapy Team Plans Landmark Clinical Trial - <em>Jan 28, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers behind KJ Muldoon&#39;s historic treatment plan new trial type that could treat multiple rare diseases with as few as 5-10 patients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team behind the world&#39;s first personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy is planning an entirely new type of clinical trial to make this technology more accessible to patients with rare diseases. Researchers at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine created a bespoke in vivo CRISPR therapy for infant KJ Muldoon in just six months.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to launch a clinical trial in 2026 that can enroll patients with any of 7 different urea cycle disorders, caused by any variant in any of 7 genes that can be corrected by the same type of gene editor used in KJ&#39;s therapy. Successful treatment of a small number of participants—as few as 5-10—might be sufficient for FDA approval.</p>
<p>This landmark case paves the way for a future with on-demand gene-editing therapies for individuals with rare, until-now untreatable genetic diseases. The approach could fundamentally change how rare disease treatments are developed and approved, making personalized medicine a reality for thousands of patients with ultra-rare conditions.</p>
<h3>CRISPR CAR-T Therapy Shows 70% Complete Response in Cancer Trials - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy zugo-cel achieves remarkable results in B-cell lymphoma and autoimmune disease trials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy, zugo-cel (CTX112), is showing remarkable early promise in clinical trials for both autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), a 100M-cell dose induced rapid B-cell depletion and clinical improvement.</p>
<p>Importantly, the therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) observed. In relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma patients, a higher 600M-cell dose achieved an impressive complete response rate of 70%.</p>
<p>These results position zugo-cel as a potential breakthrough in both oncology and autoimmune disease treatment, with the allogeneic (off-the-shelf) approach potentially making CAR-T therapy accessible to far more patients than current autologous approaches that require manufacturing cells from each individual patient.</p>
<h3>iECURE&#39;s Gene Editing Treatment Receives Dual Fast-Track Designations - <em>Jan 21, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ECUR-506 secures both FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation and UK Innovation Passport for treating neonatal conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>iECURE&#39;s ECUR-506 gene editing treatment has received significant regulatory recognition, securing both the US FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation and a UK Innovation Passport. These designations will accelerate the development pathway for this promising therapy targeting severe neonatal conditions.</p>
<p>The treatment targets severe neonatal conditions where early intervention is critical. The dual regulatory fast-tracking demonstrates international recognition of the therapy&#39;s potential to address unmet medical needs in some of the most vulnerable patient populations.</p>
<p>RMAT designation provides intensive FDA guidance, eligibility for priority review, and potential accelerated approval, while the UK Innovation Passport offers similar benefits in the British regulatory system, positioning ECUR-506 for rapid global development. This dual recognition underscores growing momentum for gene editing therapies treating conditions that were previously considered untreatable.</p>

<h1>Weekly Finance Briefing</h1>
<p><strong>Week of January 27 - February 2, 2026</strong></p>
<p><em>Research Generated: February 3, 2026, 11:45 AM PST</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Inflation &amp; Finance Metrics</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady in Split Decision Amid Political Pressure - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The FOMC voted 10-2 to keep interest rates at 3.50%-3.75%, ending a string of three consecutive quarter-point cuts as Chair Powell described the economy as on &quot;firm footing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, January 28, marking the central bank&#39;s first pause since July 2025. The decision came after three consecutive quarter-point reductions delivered between September and December 2025, which Powell characterized as having moved policy toward a &quot;neutral&quot; range. Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented from the decision, favoring continued cuts.</p>
<p>In his post-meeting press conference, Chair Jerome Powell stated that &quot;if you look at the incoming data since the last meeting, there is clear improvement in the outlook for growth. Inflation performed about as expected, and some of the labor market data came in suggesting evidence of stabilization.&quot; Powell noted there was &quot;broad support on the Committee for holding today,&quot; including among non-voting members, though some wanted to continue cutting.</p>
<p>Futures markets now expect at most two quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2026, with the first anticipated in June and a second in the fall, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The decision comes as President Trump announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would replace Powell when his term ends in May.</p>
<h3>Government Shutdown Delays Key January Jobs Report - <em>Feb 2, 10:30 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the January employment report will not be released as scheduled on February 6 after lawmakers failed to reach funding agreement following controversial DHS enforcement actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government partially shut down on January 31 after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding, an impasse sparked by outcry over the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota—specifically the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6.</p>
<p>In addition to the January jobs report, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) release for December 2025 and the Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for December 2025 will also be rescheduled. The BLS stated that &quot;due to the partial federal government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will suspend data collection, processing, and dissemination.&quot;</p>
<p>Signs from Capitol Hill suggest this shutdown will be brief—unlike the 43-day shutdown that concluded November 12. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he anticipates passing funding legislation early this week. Unlike in last year&#39;s shutdown, which resulted in major inflation and unemployment data going uncollected for October, the relevant data has already been collected. Economists had expected the January jobs report to show employers added 80,000 jobs last month, up from 50,000 in December.</p>
<h3>Tariff Costs Set to Hit Consumers Harder as Businesses Pass Along Price Increases - <em>Jan 30, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After absorbing roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, businesses are now passing those costs to consumers, with the figure expected to flip to just 20% business absorption later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump&#39;s tariffs are increasingly impacting consumer prices as businesses exhaust their pretariff inventory and begin passing costs to shoppers. According to JPMorgan analysis, businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that ratio could shrink to just 20% later this year as companies implement further price hikes. Goldman Sachs economists estimated that tariffs caused inflation to increase by half a percentage point in 2025.</p>
<p>According to NBER research, since President Trump announced broad tariff measures starting in the spring, the import taxes increased the inflation rate by 0.7 percentage points between March and August. The annual inflation rate for August—which was 2.9%—would have been 2.2% without tariffs. Before Trump took office, the U.S. average effective tariff rate was 2.4%, according to estimates from the Yale Budget Lab. At the end of 2025, it was 16.8%.</p>
<p>Consumer goods with the steepest price increases since Trump took office tend to be those with lower profit margins. Prices of heavily imported items—including tomatoes and coffee—have changed more significantly than most other goods. The United States collected $187 billion more in tariff revenue in 2025 than it did in 2024, a nearly 200% increase. According to Budget Lab research, tariffs represent an income loss of $1,700 for the average U.S. household.</p>
<h3>Warren Report: Households Paid $2,120 More Due to Inflation in 2025 - <em>Jan 30, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Warren&#39;s team found year-on-year inflation equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, with lower-income families facing costs exceeding 5% of their income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren released a report through the Senate Banking Committee detailing how households paid an estimated $2,120 more in 2025 because of inflation—including an estimated $123 more on electricity bills and an estimated $150 more for groceries. The year-on-year inflation increase equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, assuming they purchased the same goods and services in 2025 that they bought in 2024.</p>
<p>Higher prices have fallen hardest on those least able to afford them. In 2025, the bottom 20% of households faced roughly $950 in additional inflation-related costs—more than 5% of their estimated income. In contrast, although the top 20% paid more in absolute dollars, those costs amounted to just 2% of their estimated income. The report documents sharp price increases for everyday grocery staples, including coffee and beef prices, which are up a respective 29% and 21% since January 2025.</p>
<p>The report comes as the annual inflation rate in the United States was 2.7% for the 12 months ending December, according to U.S. Labor Department data released on January 13, 2026. While inflation is off its 40-year highs from 2022, the rate is still running closer to 3% than the Fed&#39;s 2% goal, causing concern among some FOMC officials who either want rate cuts paused or eliminated until there&#39;s more evidence that price increases are easing.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Case Threatens Fed Independence as Powell Calls It &quot;Most Important&quot; in 113 Years - <em>Jan 21, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments in the Lisa Cook case, while separately facing DOJ subpoenas over building renovations that he characterizes as &quot;pretexts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments on January 21 in a landmark case addressing whether President Donald Trump can fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell called the case &quot;perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed&#39;s 113-year history,&quot; adding that &quot;as I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn&#39;t attend.&quot; The case tests the legal boundaries of presidential power and the independence of the central bank.</p>
<p>Trump cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements in applying for home mortgages. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term. All three former living Fed chairs—Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen—signed on to a legal brief arguing against Cook&#39;s removal, along with a group of former Treasury secretaries and chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>The Trump administration also hit the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on January 9, initiating a criminal investigation into Powell for his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June regarding cost overruns at Federal Reserve building renovations. Powell stated: &quot;This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of federal reserve buildings. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.&quot;</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Developments</h2>
<h3>Bitcoin Crashes Below $75,000 in Weekend Bloodbath, Marking Fourth Consecutive Monthly Decline - <em>Feb 2, 9:15 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since April 2025, wiping roughly $800 billion in market value since its October peak and knocking it out of the global top 10 assets as leveraged long positions were liquidated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin plunged below $75,000 on Sunday, February 2, extending a drawdown that has wiped more than 30% off the value of the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency since its October 2025 peak of approximately $126,000. The move marked Bitcoin&#39;s lowest level since April 2025, when markets were rattled by U.S. tariff announcements. The drop capped Bitcoin&#39;s fourth consecutive monthly decline and its longest losing streak in seven years.</p>
<p>A confluence of factors drove the crash: President Trump&#39;s nomination of Kevin Warsh—a known monetary hawk—to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair landed as a shock to markets, immediately resetting expectations for rate cuts. The U.S. dollar surged, rate-cut odds for the first half of 2026 collapsed, and risk assets were repriced lower. Disappointing earnings from Magnificent Seven tech companies cracked the AI narrative, while a violent precious metals unwind added to risk-off sentiment.</p>
<p>Data from Glassnode confirms that Bitcoin fell below its True Market Mean—currently at $80,500—for the first time in 30 months. Historically, a breach of this level marks a switch from a bullish cycle to a medium-term bearish trend. Compass Point analysts say the crypto bear market is in its &quot;final innings,&quot; with bitcoin likely to bottom between $60,000 and $68,000 absent a broader U.S. equity bear market. They warn that the $70,000 to $80,000 range is an &quot;air pocket&quot; with little structural support.</p>
<h3>January 2026 Bitcoin ETF Outflows Hit $1.6 Billion as Institutional Appetite Evaporates - <em>Jan 31, 4:30 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted their worst month since launch with $1.61 billion in net outflows, while BlackRock&#39;s IBIT alone shed over $500 million in a single day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>January 2026 proved to be a brutal reset month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posting -$1.61 billion in net outflows for the month. Total monthly traded value reached $86.99 billion, with $106.96 billion in total net assets at month end. The ETF bid that underpinned Bitcoin through much of 2025 has effectively evaporated.</p>
<p>U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs suffered heavy redemptions on January 29, with nearly $1 billion yanked in a single session. Investors withdrew $817.9 million from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs on January 29, the largest daily outflow since November 20. BlackRock&#39;s IBIT bore the brunt of redemptions, shedding $317.8 million, while Fidelity&#39;s FBTC lost $168 million and Grayscale&#39;s GBTC saw $119.4 million exit.</p>
<p>The 11 spot ETFs cumulatively registered a net outflow of $1.09 billion in December after a much steeper $3.48 billion in November. That amounts to a combined two-month redemption worth $4.57 billion—the largest since their debut in January 2024. On the Ethereum side, January 30 showed net ETF flow of -$252.87 million, with $1.80 billion traded value and $15.86 billion total net assets.</p>
<h3>$2.5 Billion Liquidation Cascade Amplifies Crypto Downturn - <em>Jan 31, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Forced deleveraging triggered over $2.5 billion in liquidations in a single 24-hour period, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion as overleveraged traders were forced to close positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of forced selling was staggering, with more than $2 billion of bitcoin long and short positions liquidated since Thursday, January 30. This wasn&#39;t a gradual correction—it was a violent deleveraging wave that forced prices down sharply. Market structure evidence supports a liquidity and positioning driven move into month end.</p>
<p>In a single 24-hour period, $2.53 billion in futures liquidations occurred, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion. Ethereum was the hardest hit, accounting for nearly half of the total carnage with $1.14 billion in liquidations. Forced deleveraging acted as a direct transmission mechanism, with estimated 24-hour liquidations exceeding $1.7 billion around January 30, followed by an estimated $2.5 billion on January 31.</p>
<p>Bitcoin fell about 12% in the last seven days, wiping off more than $200 billion in market value and triggering over $2 billion in forced liquidations, creating a cascading effect that amplified the downturn. According to analysts, the outflows coincided with a broader risk-off sentiment driven by hawkish Fed expectations and geopolitical tensions, with ETF flows reacting to price weakness rather than leading it.</p>
<h3>Senate Agriculture Committee Advances Landmark Crypto Regulation Bill - <em>Jan 29, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In a historic first, a crypto market structure bill advanced beyond a Senate committee as the Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act passed on a 12-11 party-line vote, establishing CFTC regulatory authority over digital commodities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines on January 29 to advance its version of a cryptocurrency market structure bill, marking the first time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act advanced on a 12-11 vote with all Republicans voting &quot;yes&quot; and all Democrats voting &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislation would establish a clear legal definition of digital commodities and create a spot market digital commodity intermediary regulatory regime with the CFTC. It would also create consumer protections, including conflict of interest safeguards and customer disclosure requirements. The proposed bill grants regulatory authority to both the CFTC and the SEC and clarifies the jurisdictional scope between the two agencies—the CFTC would be granted explicit authority over spot market digital asset commodities, while the SEC would maintain authority over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract.</p>
<p>The crypto industry now has two permanent, crypto-friendly chairmen at the SEC and CFTC, with no Democratic pushback. Paul Atkins leads the SEC, while Trump nominee Mike Selig won confirmation late last month and was sworn in as CFTC chairman on December 22. The Senate Banking Committee would also need to approve its version of a crypto market structure bill before the two measures could combine and advance to the full Senate.</p>
<h3>Geopolitical Tensions and Iran Explosion Rattle Crypto Markets - <em>Feb 1, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A sharp escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, including an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port, triggered a wave of selling across crypto, gold, silver, and U.S. stock futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto markets extended their decline as geopolitical tensions escalated, with the selloff gathering pace following reports of an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port—a critical shipping hub on the Strait of Hormuz that handles about a fifth of the world&#39;s seaborne oil. Bitcoin fell sharply, sliding below the $80,000 mark to levels last seen in April 2025, while Ethereum hovered near $2,200 as a wave of liquidations hit leveraged positions during low-liquidity weekend trading.</p>
<p>For the first time, the United States has sanctioned crypto exchanges linked to Iran. This decision, announced at the end of January 2026, targets two British platforms accused of facilitating transactions for Iranian entities under embargo—specifically Zedex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd. for their alleged role in financing Iranian entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>Iran&#39;s crypto ecosystem reached over $7.78 billion in 2025, having grown at a notably faster pace compared to the year prior. Iran&#39;s crypto activity shows significant spikes corresponding to major domestic and geopolitical events. During Iran&#39;s recent protests and internet blackout from December 28, 2025 to January 8, 2026, there were substantial increases in both daily dollar amounts transacted and withdrawals from Iranian exchanges to personal Bitcoin wallets—suggesting Iranians are taking possession of Bitcoin at a markedly higher rate as a rational response to the collapse of the Iranian rial.</p>
