<h3>1. US-Iran Nuclear Talks Conclude in Oman with Agreement to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States and Iran concluded indirect nuclear talks mediated by Oman in Muscat on Friday, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi calling the session &quot;a good start&quot; focused solely on the nuclear issue, as both sides agreed to hold follow-on discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met directly with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi during the day-long session, which ran from 10 AM to 6 PM local time with Oman serving as intermediary between the two delegations. The talks represented the first restart of nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Tehran since last summer&#39;s military strikes against Iran, and focused exclusively on Iran&#39;s nuclear program rather than broader regional issues, according to IRNA.</p>
<p>The talks took place against a backdrop of massive U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf, with President Trump warning he could pivot to military action if negotiations fail to produce results quickly. Prediction markets now price a U.S. strike on Iran by mid-February at 31%, rising to 44% by month&#39;s end. The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has driven strike odds higher, particularly after an F-35 from the carrier shot down an Iranian Shahed-139 drone on February 3 that &quot;aggressively approached&quot; the ship.</p>
<p>In a sign that Washington intends to maintain economic pressure alongside diplomacy, the administration announced new sanctions on the same day talks concluded, targeting 15 entities, two individuals, and 14 shadow fleet vessels linked to Iran&#39;s illicit oil trade. The inconclusive outcome — characterized as suspended &quot;for now&quot; rather than collapsed — leaves open the possibility of resumed negotiations, though the timeline remains unclear as both sides face significant domestic political constraints.</p>

<h3>2. Ukraine Peace Talks in Abu Dhabi Yield Prisoner Swap and Military Dialogue Agreement</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two days of trilateral peace talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in Abu Dhabi produced a deal to exchange 314 prisoners of war — the first such swap since September — and an agreement to reestablish high-level U.S.-Russia military-to-military dialogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced Thursday that the talks had yielded concrete results, with both sides agreeing to the prisoner exchange and the restoration of direct military communication channels between Washington and Moscow. Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev said there was &quot;positive movement forward,&quot; while Ukraine&#39;s lead negotiator Rustem Umerov described the discussions as &quot;substantive and productive, focused on concrete steps and practical solutions.&quot;</p>
<p>The main sticking point remains the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine. Moscow demands Kyiv withdraw troops from all of the Donetsk region, including a line of heavily fortified cities regarded as one of Ukraine&#39;s strongest defenses. Ukraine insists the conflict should be frozen along the current front lines and rejects any unilateral pullback. President Zelensky revealed ahead of the talks that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, with a &quot;large number&quot; still officially missing — though independent estimates from CSIS place the toll between 100,000 and 140,000.</p>
<p>The talks mark a significant diplomatic milestone as the war approaches its fourth anniversary this month, with the fact that all three parties are engaging directly described as notable in itself. However, European allies have expressed concern about being excluded from the process, and the fundamental territorial disputes appear far from resolution. A third round of talks has not yet been formally announced.</p>

<h3>3. Islamabad Mosque Suicide Bombing Kills 31 in Deadliest Attack on Capital Since 2008</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A suicide bomber attacked the Khadija Tul Kubra Mosque, a Shia mosque in Islamabad&#39;s southeastern Tarlai Kalan neighborhood, during Friday congregational prayers, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 169 in the deadliest attack on Pakistan&#39;s capital since the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attacker was stopped at the mosque&#39;s entrance by security personnel before opening fire and detonating explosives inside or near the mosque, causing significant structural damage and scattering debris across the surrounding area. ISIL&#39;s Pakistan branch (ISPP) claimed responsibility for what appears to be its deadliest operation in the country since its formation in May 2019. Pakistani authorities arrested four alleged &quot;facilitators&quot; on February 7 as thousands of mourners attended funeral prayers for the victims.</p>
<p>The attack comes amid a surge in militant violence across Pakistan, following the Balochistan Liberation Army&#39;s &quot;Operation Herof 2.0&quot; in late January that killed over 225 people across nine districts. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the bombing as a &quot;cowardly act of terrorism&quot; and declared a state of emergency in the capital, with hospitals appealing for blood donations. The UN Secretary-General also condemned the attack, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>The bombing has sharpened focus on cross-border security challenges, with Pakistani officials pointing to militant safe havens along the Afghan-Pakistan border. The escalating violence — from Balochistan separatist attacks to sectarian bombings in the capital — underscores the breadth of security threats facing Pakistan&#39;s government as it struggles to contain multiple insurgent and extremist movements simultaneously.</p>

<h3>4. Russia Escalates Hybrid Warfare Across Europe with Sabotage and Infrastructure Attacks</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia has dramatically escalated its hybrid warfare campaign against Western Europe since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with intelligence reports confirming a four-fold increase in sabotage operations in 2024 compared to the prior year and the surge accelerating through 2025 and into 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polish authorities revealed that two Ukrainian citizens hired by Russian intelligence used explosives to attempt to destroy a Warsaw-Ukraine railway line in November 2025 — a route crucially important for delivering military aid to Ukraine. A train conductor noticed the warped rail near the village of Mika, approximately 130 kilometers from the Polish-Ukrainian border, and alerted police. Poland subsequently expelled Russia&#39;s consul in Gdansk, and Interpol issued red notices for the two suspects, believed to have fled to Belarus.</p>
<p>Experts identify three pillars of Russian hybrid warfare expected to escalate in 2026: sabotage targeting Europe&#39;s expanding defense production infrastructure and Ukraine-bound supply chains; subversion through information warfare during key elections including Hungary&#39;s 2026 vote and the U.S. midterms; and coercion through increasingly aggressive airspace and naval violations. The attack on Romania&#39;s Cugir arms factory last year demonstrated Russia&#39;s willingness to target defense manufacturing directly.</p>
<p>Moscow&#39;s strategic objective is to weaken Western unity by creating a constant sense of vulnerability without crossing the threshold that would trigger a formal NATO response. Analysts warn that Europe still lacks credible hybrid deterrence, and the West&#39;s failure to establish clear thresholds for hybrid warfare has created a strategic vacuum that Russia continues to exploit. The campaign has expanded from espionage into drone-based airport shutdowns, arson attacks, and direct targeting of critical infrastructure.</p>

<h3>5. State Department Orders Deletion of All Pre-Trump Social Media Posts from Official Accounts</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. State Department has directed the removal of all posts made by its official accounts on the social media platform X before President Trump returned to office on January 20, 2025, with staff told that anyone wanting to access the deleted content must file a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The directive applies to all the department&#39;s active official X accounts, including those for U.S. embassies and missions worldwide, ambassadors, department bureaus, and programs, according to internal guidance screenshots obtained by NPR. The posts to be removed include embassy July 4th livestreams, photos of COVID vaccine donations to other nations, holiday greetings, condolences, cultural programming, and the day-to-day record of diplomatic engagements showing who the U.S. met with, when, and how.</p>
<p>Current and former State Department employees, as well as academics, have raised concerns that the purge will make the historical record of government communications and actions harder to trace. While the posts will be internally archived, requiring FOIA requests for access differs significantly from how the U.S. government typically handles archiving the online footprint of previous administrations. Critics argue the move effectively erases the public digital record of American diplomacy spanning multiple years.</p>
<p>The social media purge comes as the State Department undergoes broader changes under the Trump administration, with the deletion order representing one of the most sweeping acts of institutional digital erasure in modern U.S. government history. The move raises questions about government transparency and the preservation of public records, particularly as social media has become a primary channel through which governments communicate with domestic and international audiences.</p>

<h3>6. Colombia-Ecuador Trade War Escalates with Tit-for-Tat Tariffs and Energy Cutoffs</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecuador&#39;s imposition of a 30% &quot;security tariff&quot; on Colombian imports over drug trafficking failures has spiraled into a full-scale trade war, with Colombia retaliating by halting electricity exports, imposing reciprocal tariffs, and Ecuador responding with a 900% increase in oil pipeline fees for Colombian crude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crisis erupted when President Daniel Noboa announced Ecuador would levy a 30% tariff on its neighbor until Colombia showed &quot;a real commitment to jointly confronting drug-trafficking and illegal mining at the border.&quot; Colombia&#39;s Ministry of Commerce responded with a 30% tariff on 23 Ecuadorian products, while the Ministry of Mines and Energy announced an indefinite suspension of all international electricity sales to Ecuador, framing the move as essential to safeguarding Colombia&#39;s energy sovereignty.</p>
<p>The escalation has spread to energy infrastructure, with Ecuador raising the tariff for each barrel of Colombian oil transported through its state-owned Trans-Ecuadorian Oil Pipeline System from $3 to $30 per barrel — a 900% increase. Colombian and Ecuadorian merchants and truckers have staged protests at border crossings, warning that the trade war will devastate border economies and disrupt energy supplies in both countries. The reciprocal tariffs are affecting bilateral commerce worth approximately $2.3 billion annually.</p>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro met with President Trump in Washington on February 3 and reportedly asked the U.S. to mediate the dispute. Ecuador faces a trade deficit of more than $1 billion with Colombia, and Noboa has framed the tariffs as a national security measure against narcotics trafficking. However, analysts warn that the economic fallout — particularly the suspension of Colombian electricity to an energy-dependent Ecuador — risks creating a humanitarian dimension to what began as a diplomatic dispute.</p>

<h3>7. US Government Shutdown Ends But DHS Faces Second Closure as ICE Reform Talks Stall</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The partial U.S. government shutdown that began January 31 ended on February 3 when Trump signed a $1 trillion spending package, but the Department of Homeland Security faces a second shutdown on February 13 as negotiations over ICE reform demands remain deadlocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The House approved the spending package 217-214, funding several of the government&#39;s largest departments through September. However, the deal separated DHS funding into a two-week extension, giving lawmakers until February 13 to negotiate Democratic demands for immigration enforcement reforms prompted by the killings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti during ICE operations in Minneapolis. Democrats are demanding body cameras, identification requirements, a ban on agents hiding their identities, and judicial warrants for enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer issued a list of 10 demands, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune described reaching agreement in the remaining time as &quot;an impossibility.&quot; Republicans say they are open to body-worn cameras — already included in the underlying DHS spending bill with $20 million allocated — but reject warrant restrictions and mask bans. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered body cameras for agents in Minneapolis but Democrats want reforms codified into law rather than relying on executive discretion.</p>
<p>The funding impasse has broader consequences beyond DHS operations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39; January jobs report was delayed from February 7 to February 11 due to the shutdown&#39;s disruption of data collection. With only days remaining before the DHS funding deadline, the prospect of a second partial shutdown looms large, creating additional uncertainty for markets and federal employees already rattled by the first closure.</p>

<h3>8. Zelensky Reveals 55,000 Ukrainian Soldiers Killed as War Nears Fourth Anniversary</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky disclosed that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, with a &quot;large number&quot; still officially missing, as the war approaches its fourth anniversary amid ongoing peace talks in Abu Dhabi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure represents a significant increase from Zelensky&#39;s previous disclosures — 46,000 killed reported in February 2025 and 31,000 in February 2024 — suggesting the pace of casualties has not meaningfully slowed despite changes in the front-line dynamics. Independent estimates from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies place the actual toll significantly higher, between 100,000 and 140,000 killed, suggesting official figures substantially undercount the true cost of the conflict.</p>
<p>Zelensky&#39;s revelation came in an interview with French media ahead of the second round of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi, timed to build public support for meaningful negotiations as European and American audiences increasingly focus on the war&#39;s human cost. The disclosure represents a rare moment of public candor from Kyiv, which has generally withheld detailed casualty figures to maintain domestic morale and international support.</p>
<p>The fourth winter of Russia&#39;s war has been particularly brutal, with heat and electricity blackouts lasting for days as Russia repeatedly targets Ukraine&#39;s energy grid. The toll on Ukrainian society extends far beyond military casualties, with millions displaced internally and abroad. As peace talks continue, the cumulative human cost of the war — now acknowledged at unprecedented scale by Ukraine&#39;s own president — is increasingly shaping the calculus of all parties involved in negotiations.</p>

<h3>9. Winter Olympics Competition Begins with First Gold Medals Awarded in Milan Cortina</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2026 Winter Olympics entered full competition mode on Saturday, with Swiss racer Franjo von Allmen capturing the Olympic downhill to win the first gold medal of the Milan Cortina Games, as medal events begin across cross-country skiing, speed skating, snowboarding, and other disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day after Thursday&#39;s spectacular opening ceremony at Milan&#39;s San Siro stadium — which featured dual cauldron lightings in Milan and Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo and performances by Andrea Bocelli and Mariah Carey — athletes from 93 countries began competing across venues spanning northern Italy&#39;s Lombardy and Veneto regions. The Games, Italy&#39;s first Winter Olympics since Turin 2006, feature 116 medal events across 16 disciplines through February 22.</p>
<p>One of the most closely watched storylines is American alpine skiing legend Lindsey Vonn, who announced her return to professional racing in November 2024 with the goal of competing in Milan Cortina. However, just a week before the opening ceremony, Vonn crashed in Crans Montana, Switzerland, completely rupturing her ACL. Despite the injury, she has confirmed she will race in the women&#39;s downhill on Sunday, February 8, in what would be a remarkable feat of determination.</p>
<p>The Games carry significant geopolitical undertones as the world&#39;s athletes compete against a backdrop of ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, rising U.S.-Iran tensions, and trade disputes across multiple continents. The ceremony&#39;s theme of &quot;Harmony&quot; — reflecting the connection between Milan and Cortina despite the physical distance — offers a contrast to the fractured state of international relations outside the Olympic venues.</p>

<h3>10. EU-China Trade Tensions Deepen as Beijing&#39;s Industrial Overcapacity Threatens European Manufacturing</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Union faces what economists are calling a second &quot;China shock&quot; as Beijing&#39;s industrial overcapacity spreads beyond electric vehicles into semiconductors, wind components, pharmaceuticals, and industrial machinery, threatening the foundations of Europe&#39;s manufacturing base while bilateral trade imbalances widen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China now accounts for roughly one-third of total global value-added manufacturing, with its trade surplus approaching $1 trillion last year as domestic consumption fails to keep pace with industrial output. The EU, as China&#39;s largest export partner, is piling up protective measures including a planned fixed customs duty on low-value e-commerce parcels from July 2026, aimed at curbing cheap imports predominantly from China. Meanwhile, China has retaliated against EU electric vehicle tariffs by targeting European dairy, brandy, and pork imports.</p>
<p>The semiconductor dimension adds a strategic security layer to the economic tensions. Beijing has long argued the EU could help rebalance trade by selling advanced chips and manufacturing equipment currently under export restrictions, but European leaders remain wary of enabling Chinese technological advancement in sensitive areas. A recent shift in U.S. policy — with Trump authorizing sales of some advanced Nvidia chips to China — has complicated Europe&#39;s own calculus, as analysts note that outright restrictions have paradoxically incentivized China to develop its own semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>A critical moment approaches with China&#39;s anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy imports set to conclude on February 21, with provisional tariffs on European dairy products already reduced from as high as 42.7% to 11.7%. On the EV front, both sides have made progress toward a minimum price mechanism that could replace punitive tariffs. However, the structural challenge remains: Chinese overinvestment across a range of industries shows no signs of abating, leaving Europe caught between protecting domestic industry and maintaining access to affordable goods.</p>

<h3>1. Gold Surges Past $5,000 to Record Highs as Safe-Haven Demand Soars</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-11.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gold blasted through the $5,000 per ounce barrier for the first time in history, surging to $5,078 on Wednesday in its strongest single-day rally in 20 years, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, central bank buying, and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The precious metal&#39;s ascent has been staggering — up 73.6% compared to a year ago and 11.4% in just the past month. Central bank purchases have been a major catalyst, with Beijing extending its gold-buying streak for a 13th consecutive month, adding 30,000 ounces to reserves and bringing China&#39;s total stock to 74.12 million ounces. The de-dollarization trend among emerging market central banks has created sustained structural demand independent of traditional safe-haven flows.</p>
<p>JPMorgan issued its most bullish gold forecast yet at $6,300 per ounce by year-end 2026, while Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale target $6,000. The rally reflects a convergence of factors rarely seen simultaneously: rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the ongoing Ukraine war, persistent inflation concerns, a weakening U.S. dollar, and growing uncertainty about the trajectory of Federal Reserve policy. Gold&#39;s breakout above $5,000 triggered significant momentum-driven buying.</p>
<p>However, the rally has not been without volatility. After reaching $5,600 intraday on February 4, gold experienced a sharp pullback to $4,770 by Friday, a correction of nearly 15% that rattled traders who had chased the breakout higher. The whipsaw action underscores the speculative froth that has entered the gold market alongside genuine safe-haven demand, with analysts warning that while the structural bull case remains intact, the pace of gains has created conditions ripe for violent corrections.</p>

<h3>2. Palantir Surges 11% After Blowout Earnings as AI Government Spending Boom Lifts Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Technologies reported Q4 2025 revenue of $1.41 billion — up 70% year-over-year — beating estimates of $1.33 billion with adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share versus expectations of 23 cents, sending shares up 11% as CEO Alex Karp called it &quot;the best results that I&#39;m aware of in tech in the last decade.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U.S. commercial revenue surged 137% to $507 million, while government revenue grew 66% year-over-year, driven by new contracts including a $448 million U.S. Navy deal to launch ShipOS for AI-powered shipbuilding modernization. Total contract value reached $4.26 billion, up 138% from the prior year. The Pentagon&#39;s 2026 budget request included a record $13.4 billion dedicated line item for AI — the first in DoD history — positioning Palantir as a primary beneficiary of the government AI spending wave.</p>
<p>Management guided 2026 revenue to $7.18-$7.20 billion, implying an accelerated growth rate above 60% that would make Palantir the fastest company in software history to approach $10 billion in annual revenue at its current margins. The guidance far exceeded Wall Street expectations and triggered a wave of analyst upgrades. William Blair upgraded shares to Buy ahead of the report with a $200 price target, and multiple firms raised their estimates following the results.</p>
<p>The stock&#39;s valuation remains a point of contention, with Palantir trading at approximately 174 times forward earnings and a forward price-to-sales ratio of 67.5. While the growth trajectory is exceptional, the rich multiple exposes the stock to sharp corrections on any disappointment. The company&#39;s positioning at the intersection of government AI spending and commercial enterprise adoption has made it one of the market&#39;s most debated stocks, with bulls pointing to the unprecedented demand environment and bears arguing that the valuation already prices in perfection.</p>

<h3>3. Crude Oil Surges to Six-Month Highs on Iran Risk Premium Before Diplomatic Whipsaw</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent crude oil breached $72 per barrel, marking a six-month high as the U.S.-Iran standoff drove a geopolitical risk premium estimated at $7-$8 per barrel, before crashing back toward $60 on Friday as diplomatic progress in Oman talks drained the war premium overnight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rally saw prices climb nearly 12% from the start of the year, fueled by the U.S. Navy&#39;s deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the Arabian Sea and the subsequent shoot-down of an Iranian Shahed-139 drone on February 3. Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guard Corps also harassed a U.S.-flagged merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, with two IRGC boats and a drone threatening to board and seize the tanker Stena Imperative — escalating fears of a disruption to the waterway through which a fifth of global oil and LNG passes.</p>
<p>Energy analysts placed the probability of a U.S. strike on Iran at 75% in the coming weeks, while Polymarket volumes on Iran strike prediction markets hit $188 million. OPEC+ added to supply uncertainty by extending voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through Q1 2026, with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other producers agreeing to pause planned output increases. BloombergNEF projected oil could reach $91 per barrel by late 2026 in an Iran disruption scenario.</p>
<p>The dramatic reversal came Friday after diplomatic talks in Oman produced what Iran called &quot;a good start,&quot; with crude plunging back toward $60 as the risk premium evaporated almost instantly. The volatile week illustrated how geopolitical speculation has become the dominant short-term driver of energy markets, overwhelming fundamental factors like demand weakness and projected oversupply. The EIA forecasts Brent averaging just $56 per barrel in 2026 if geopolitical tensions ease — a staggering gap from the $72 highs reached during the week&#39;s peak anxiety.</p>

<h3>4. Bitcoin Plummets Below $61,000 in Worst Single-Day Crash Since FTX Collapse</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin suffered its steepest one-day decline since the FTX-driven crash in November 2022, plunging 15% to touch $60,062 as forced deleveraging cascaded through cryptocurrency markets, triggering $2.6 billion in liquidations and marking a 52% drawdown from its October 2025 record high of $126,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selloff accelerated through the week as multiple negative catalysts converged: institutional demand reversed with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recording outsized net outflows, leveraged positions worth billions were forcibly unwound, and broader risk-off sentiment from the equity market tech rout spilled into digital assets. Record realized losses of approximately $3.2 billion were recorded on February 5 alone, while the total crypto market shed roughly $900 billion in market capitalization over the preceding 22 days.</p>
<p>Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan characterized the decline as &quot;a full-bore, 2022-like crypto winter,&quot; while prediction markets placed a 56% probability on Bitcoin sliding to $70,000 or below before month&#39;s end. The token briefly recovered to $69,632 on Friday, gaining 9% in a relief bounce, but analysts warned the technical damage may take considerable time to repair. The unwinding of leveraged bets has wiped out all gains accumulated since President Trump&#39;s election.</p>
<p>The crypto winter marks a dramatic reversal from the optimism that surrounded Trump&#39;s pro-crypto stance, his appointment of crypto-friendly regulators, and the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Despite these policy tailwinds, macroeconomic headwinds — including equity market volatility, geopolitical uncertainty, rising correlations with risk assets, and waning institutional appetite — have overwhelmed the bullish narrative. The total cryptocurrency market lost approximately $350 billion in a single day on February 6, with the selloff extending to Ethereum, Solana, and virtually every major digital asset.</p>

<h3>5. Disney Names Josh D&#39;Amaro as Next CEO to Succeed Bob Iger Effective March 18</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney Company named Josh D&#39;Amaro, the 28-year company veteran who leads its Experiences division encompassing theme parks, cruise ships, and resorts, as its next chief executive officer to replace Bob Iger, marking the second CEO succession attempt in six years after Iger&#39;s previous pick Bob Chapek was ousted in 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D&#39;Amaro&#39;s appointment comes with a compensation package worth up to $45 million, with Iger remaining as a board member and senior advisor through the end of 2026. Dana Walden was simultaneously named president and chief creative officer, reporting to D&#39;Amaro effective March 18. The transition ends a closely watched succession process that had narrowed to D&#39;Amaro and Walden as the two internal frontrunners, with the board ultimately selecting the executive whose division generates the company&#39;s highest margins.</p>
<p>Disney reported fiscal Q1 2026 results the same week, with revenue of $25.98 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.63 beating analyst expectations of $25.74 billion and $1.57 respectively. Strength in parks and streaming drove the outperformance, though shares initially dropped 7% after the company warned of headwinds from declining international tourist attendance at domestic parks — a trend attributed to the strong U.S. dollar and global economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>D&#39;Amaro inherits a company navigating multiple strategic crossroads: the streaming business has turned profitable but faces intensifying competition, the parks division requires massive capital investment to maintain competitive advantages, and the traditional media business continues its structural decline. Analysts note that D&#39;Amaro&#39;s parks background positions him well for Disney&#39;s highest-margin business but raises questions about his approach to content strategy and the company&#39;s evolving relationship with technology platforms.</p>

<h3>6. UPS to Cut 30,000 Jobs in 2026 as Amazon Breakup Reshapes Delivery Giant</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan 27</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>United Parcel Service announced plans to eliminate 30,000 positions in 2026 through attrition and voluntary separation programs, while closing 24 buildings in the first half of the year, as the shipping giant continues unwinding its partnership with Amazon in a transformation expected to save $3 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The job cuts follow 48,000 positions eliminated in 2025, making UPS one of the largest sources of U.S. job losses over the two-year period. The company reduced Amazon&#39;s volume by approximately 1 million packages per day in 2025 and plans to cut another million pieces daily in 2026, reducing total operational hours by approximately 25 million. The Amazon wind-down represents a deliberate strategic pivot away from low-margin e-commerce delivery toward higher-value healthcare, small business, and specialty shipping markets.</p>
<p>The reductions will be accomplished primarily through attrition, with UPS offering a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers. The 24 buildings identified for closure in the first half of 2026 reflect the shrinking physical footprint needed as Amazon volumes decline, with additional closures possible later in the year. The company&#39;s network optimization efforts aim to improve operating margins that had been compressed by the high-volume, low-margin Amazon business.</p>
<p>The announcement contributed to January&#39;s overall layoff total of 108,435 — the highest January figure since 2009 — alongside Amazon&#39;s own 16,000 cuts and significant reductions in healthcare, technology, and financial services. The UPS transformation underscores a broader restructuring across logistics and transportation as companies reassess business relationships and workforce needs in a slowing economy. Analysts note that while the short-term pain is significant, the strategic pivot should improve UPS&#39;s margin profile and competitive positioning over the medium term.</p>

<h3>7. OPEC+ Extends Production Cuts Through Q1 2026 as Iran Tensions Reshape Oil Markets</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eight key OPEC+ producers — Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman — agreed to maintain voluntary production cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day through March 2026, pausing planned output increases due to seasonal factors and geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision, made during a virtual meeting on February 1, keeps the alliance&#39;s most significant production restraint in place through the first quarter, with the previously announced barrels to be returned to the market &quot;either in part or in full, depending on evolving market conditions, and only in a gradual manner.&quot; The group&#39;s next meeting is scheduled for March, when members will reassess conditions including the trajectory of U.S.-Iran tensions, Chinese demand recovery, and the impact of potential tariff escalation on global economic growth.</p>
<p>The production freeze comes as geopolitical factors have overtaken fundamentals as the primary driver of oil prices. Brent crude rallied to $72 per barrel — its highest level in six months — on fears of a U.S. military strike on Iran, with analysts estimating a $7-$8 per barrel risk premium embedded in prices. The rally temporarily masked a more bearish fundamental outlook: the EIA forecasts global oil production will exceed demand in 2026, causing inventories to rise and prices to average just $56 per barrel absent major supply disruptions.</p>
<p>Internal OPEC+ dynamics remain strained despite the show of unity. A Saudi-UAE spat over production quotas continues to simmer, with the UAE pressing for a larger output allocation to match its expanded production capacity. Compensation cuts have tripled as key producers move to rein in members who exceeded quotas. Meanwhile, the potential disruption of Iranian supply through military action or tighter sanctions adds a wildcard that could dramatically alter the supply-demand balance and force OPEC+ to recalibrate its strategy.</p>

<h3>8. Dow Crosses 50,000 for First Time as Friday Rally Caps Volatile Week</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,207 points, or 2.47%, to close at a record 50,115 on Friday, crossing the 50,000 milestone for the first time as investors rotated aggressively from battered technology stocks into value names, financials, and industrials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The historic close capped one of the most volatile weeks in recent market memory, during which the S&amp;P 500 briefly turned negative for 2026, the Nasdaq endured a tech-driven rout, and South Korea&#39;s KOSPI triggered three circuit breakers in five sessions. Friday&#39;s rally was broad-based, with chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom gaining 7.8% and 7.2% respectively as investors reconsidered the selloff&#39;s severity. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1.97% to 6,932, while the Nasdaq advanced 2.18% to 23,031.</p>
<p>Despite the Friday surge, the week revealed deepening fractures beneath the market&#39;s surface. The &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; mega-cap stocks diverged sharply: Alphabet&#39;s $185 billion AI spending plan initially spooked investors before shares recovered, while Amazon plunged 8% on its own $200 billion capex forecast and an earnings miss. The rotation from growth into value accelerated, with the Dow&#39;s 2.5% weekly gain contrasting with the Nasdaq&#39;s 1.8% weekly decline.</p>
<p>The Dow&#39;s milestone comes in a markedly different character than previous round-number breakthroughs, driven less by broad economic optimism than by a flight from overvalued technology shares into defensive sectors. Manufacturing data provided a tailwind, with ISM and S&amp;P Global PMIs showing the sharpest increase in production since May 2022. However, the delayed January jobs report, ongoing government shutdown uncertainty, and unresolved questions about AI spending returns leave investors navigating with limited visibility into the economy&#39;s true trajectory.</p>

<h3>9. ECB and Bank of England Hold Rates as Central Banks Navigate Growth-Inflation Dilemma</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Central Bank held rates unchanged at 2% for a fifth consecutive meeting while the Bank of England voted 5-4 to maintain rates at 3.75% in a closer-than-expected decision, as both central banks grappled with persistent inflation against a backdrop of weakening growth and external risks from U.S. tariff threats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bank of England&#39;s narrow vote surprised markets, with four members pushing for a 25-basis-point cut to 3.5% versus forecasts of a 7-2 hold. The tight margin signals growing internal divisions over the pace of monetary easing, with pay growth and services price inflation continuing to ease while the UK economy shows signs of strain. UK borrowing costs came under additional pressure from the Mandelson-Epstein political crisis, adding to the challenging backdrop for policymakers.</p>
<p>ECB President Christine Lagarde played down concerns about the euro&#39;s recent strength but warned the outlook remained &quot;unpredictable&quot; given tariff threats and currency volatility. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the rest of 2026, with the updated assessment confirming inflation should stabilize at the 2% target in the medium term. Eurozone economies continue to grapple with weak manufacturing output and uncertain trade policy under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The coordinated holds reflect the global challenge facing central bankers as the post-pandemic inflation cycle enters its final phase. U.S. Treasury yields fell to around 4.22% on the 10-year as weaker employment data reinforced bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts, with markets pricing a first reduction in June and a second potentially in September. The divergence between a data-dependent Fed and a politically constrained ECB creates cross-currents in currency and bond markets that add complexity to an already challenging investment landscape.</p>

<h3>10. Amazon Falls 8% on $200 Billion AI Spending Forecast Despite Strong AWS Growth</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/morning/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon shares plunged 8% on Friday after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results — with earnings per share of $1.95 missing estimates of $1.97 — and stunned investors by projecting $200 billion in 2026 capital expenditure, the largest spending commitment of any technology company in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AWS revenue expanded 24% in Q4 to beat expectations, marking what the unit&#39;s CEO called &quot;the fastest growth in 13 quarters,&quot; while total company revenue of $213.39 billion topped the $211.33 billion consensus. However, the bottom-line miss combined with the staggering capex guidance triggered an immediate selloff as investors questioned the returns timeline on such massive AI infrastructure investment. The spending plan represents a near-doubling from 2025 levels and would make Amazon the second-largest corporate capital spender after Alphabet, which announced its own $185 billion plan days earlier.</p>
<p>The combined $385 billion in AI spending commitments from just two companies in a single week crystallized investor anxiety about the AI investment cycle. Big Tech&#39;s aggregate AI capital expenditure is now approaching $700 billion, with investors increasingly asking whether these investments can generate proportional returns within a reasonable timeframe. The market&#39;s negative reaction to Amazon&#39;s plans contrasted with Alphabet&#39;s relatively muted response, suggesting that investor tolerance for AI spending escalation is reaching a breaking point.</p>
<p>Despite the near-term concerns, Amazon&#39;s cloud computing business showed genuine strength, with AWS operating income and margins improving as AI workloads drive higher-value consumption patterns. The company is investing in custom AI chips, data center construction, and networking infrastructure to serve demand from enterprise customers and its own AI services. Analysts remain broadly positive on the stock&#39;s long-term trajectory but acknowledge that the sheer scale of capital commitment creates meaningful execution risk and limits near-term earnings growth.</p>

<h3>1. Thailand Votes in Snap Election as Political Crisis Deepens with Cambodia Border Tensions</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thailand&#39;s snap general elections are underway on February 8, with 53 million eligible voters deciding the composition of the House of Representatives and voting on whether to replace the 2017 constitution, as Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul&#39;s coalition collapse coincides with escalating border tensions with Cambodia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai party, called for the dissolution of Parliament due to the inability to reach a consensus with the Prachachon party, his coalition partner, on constitutional reform. About 53 million people in the kingdom of 71 million are eligible to vote for the 500-seat House of Representatives through a mixed electoral system. Polling stations opened at 8am (01:00 GMT) and will close at 5pm (10:00 GMT), with vote counting beginning shortly after and results announced as tallies are completed.</p>
<p>A Suan Dusit University survey of 26,661 people between January 16-28 gave the progressive People&#39;s Party 36% support, with Pheu Thai at 22.1% and Bhumjaithai at 18.9%. The People&#39;s Party has been campaigning heavily before the election, with support stirring hope that the democratic future it promises may finally be within reach. The election represents a critical moment for Thai democracy, with voters weighing whether to break free from years of military-backed governance and constitutional constraints that have limited civilian political power.</p>
<p>The early election call reflects the worsening of the Thai political crisis, which coincides with increased tensions on the border with Cambodia. The Election Commission expects to know more than 90% of the unofficial vote count by around 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM local time. The official results will be announced on April 9, whereby the new House will then convene to elect a new prime minister and parliamentary speakers within 15 days, setting the stage for potential political transformation in Southeast Asia&#39;s second-largest economy.</p>
<h3>2. Haiti&#39;s Transitional Presidential Council Dissolves After Two Years of Tumultuous Rule</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haiti&#39;s presidential council stepped down on February 7 after almost two years of tumultuous rule, handing power to US-backed Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime as the country prepares for its first general elections in a decade amid rampant gang violence that has left thousands dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Transitional Presidential Council handed power to Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime after almost two years of tumultuous governance marked by rampant gang violence, with the transfer of power taking place on Saturday under tight security. The Council was sworn in at the National Palace on April 25, 2024, to exercise the powers and duties of the president of Haiti either until an elected president is inaugurated or until February 7, 2026, whichever came first—making Saturday&#39;s dissolution the constitutional endpoint of its mandate.</p>
<p>The transitional period has been characterized by escalating security challenges, with powerful gangs controlling an estimated 80% of the capital Port-au-Prince and launching coordinated attacks on government institutions, police stations, and civilian neighborhoods. The council faced criticism for internal divisions, allegations of corruption, and its inability to restore basic security and services to Haiti&#39;s 11 million citizens. International observers have questioned whether the council&#39;s dissolution and handover to the prime minister represents genuine progress toward democratic governance or merely another chapter in Haiti&#39;s prolonged political instability.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Fils-Aime is expected to remain in power as the country prepares for the first general elections in a decade, though no firm date has been set due to security concerns and logistical challenges. The United States has maintained significant influence over Haiti&#39;s transitional arrangements, providing security assistance and diplomatic backing for the current leadership structure. The dissolution of the council marks a pivotal moment for Haiti, with the coming months likely to determine whether the country can chart a path toward stability and democratic renewal or faces further fragmentation and violence.</p>
<h3>3. Jimmy Lai Faces Sentencing in Hong Kong on National Security Charges</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 9</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hong Kong media tycoon and democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai will be sentenced on February 9 in a closely watched case, with the 78-year-old founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper facing potential life imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three High Court judges who oversaw Lai&#39;s high-profile trial are expected to hand down penalties on the 78-year-old defendant at 10am on Monday, February 9. Lai was found guilty in December 2025 of two charges of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces under a China-imposed national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material. The trial has been widely viewed as a test case for Hong Kong&#39;s national security legislation and the future of press freedom in the former British colony.</p>
<p>Global leaders, including United States President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have called for Lai&#39;s release, while rights groups say his trial is a death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong. Some countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have said the trial is politically motivated and demanded Lai&#39;s immediate release. The sentencing comes as part of a broader crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong following the massive pro-democracy protests of 2019-2020, with authorities using the national security law to prosecute activists, journalists, and opposition politicians.</p>
<p>The judges will also sentence six former senior executives of Lai&#39;s Apple Daily tabloid-style newspaper, three companies associated with the outlet, and two activists in addition to Lai. International human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings as a violation of fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong&#39;s Basic Law and international human rights conventions. The case has attracted unprecedented international attention, with observers noting that the outcome will signal how far Beijing is willing to go in reshaping Hong Kong&#39;s legal and political landscape to align with mainland Chinese governance models.</p>
<h3>4. US and Russia Close to Handshake Deal to Observe Expired Nuclear Treaty</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5-8</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. and Russia are closing in on an informal agreement to continue observing the expiring New START arms control treaty beyond its February 5 expiration, with negotiators agreeing to observe the spirit of the treaty through a &quot;handshake&quot; deal as the first time in more than half a century looms without binding limits on strategic nuclear arsenals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New START treaty officially expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time since the early 1970s that there will be no legally binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces without another agreement being under negotiation. While the U.S. and Russian negotiators agreed to observe the spirit of New START, the parties have not formally signed an agreement to that effect, with one U.S. official cautioning that the agreement would have to be &quot;a handshake&quot; deal because an extension is technically not permissible by law.</p>
<p>The treaty capped the US and Russia each at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers, and up to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. It also established detailed transparency and verification mechanisms, including data exchanges, notifications, and on-site inspections that provided critical insight into each nation&#39;s nuclear capabilities. Russia suspended the treaty in early 2023 over Washington&#39;s support for Ukraine, though Moscow said it would still observe agreed upon restrictions.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a &quot;grave moment&quot; as the final US-Russia nuclear arms treaty expired, noting that for the first time in more than half a century, the world faces a situation without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two countries that possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons, or more than 10,500 warheads combined. President Trump has suggested that if New START expires, a &quot;better&quot; agreement could be negotiated and said that China should be included, though Beijing has consistently argued that it will not join formal arms control negotiations while its arsenal remains far smaller than those of the US and Russia.</p>
<h3>5. US Military Buildup in Middle East Reaches Largest Scale Since 2003 Iraq Invasion</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-05.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and its strike group deployed to the Middle East on January 26 as part of the largest U.S. military buildup in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with Trump administration envoys signaling military resolve to Iran aboard the carrier on February 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was deployed to the Middle East on January 26, 2026, with its strike group, including guided-missile destroyers, cruisers, support vessels, and surveillance aircraft. The USS Abraham Lincoln serves as a mobile airfield and the flagship vessel of the US Navy&#39;s Carrier Strike Group 3, an operational formation that includes several thousand personnel—likely between 6,000 and 7,000 sailors and marines. Middle East analysts say people close to President Trump believe he is likely to strike Iran, with discussions centered around the U.S. military buildup in the region being the largest since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>CENTCOM chief Admiral Brad Cooper, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, who are leading negotiations with Iran, boarded the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier on February 7 in an apparent signal of military resolve to Iran. The high-profile visit came as diplomatic talks between the U.S. and Iran continued in Oman regarding nuclear issues, with Iran&#39;s foreign minister describing the discussions as &quot;a good start&quot; while noting that decisions on further rounds of talks would be taken after consultation with Tehran.</p>
<p>On February 3, 2026, six IRGC Navy gunboats attempted to stop and seize a US tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, but the Stena Imperative tanker ignored their demands and continued toward the Arabian Sea under the escort of the USS McFaul (DDG 74). Moreover, a US F-35 fighter jet shot down an Iranian Shahed 139 drone approaching the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, marking a significant escalation in tensions. Concerns over potential military escalation have mounted, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warning that any confrontation could spark a wider regional war that could draw in multiple Middle Eastern nations and potentially trigger a global oil crisis.</p>
<h3>6. Vietnam&#39;s Internal Military Document Reveals Preparations for Potential US War</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-06.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An internal Vietnamese military document issued by the Navy under the Ministry of Defense shows Vietnam&#39;s military was taking steps to prepare for a possible American &quot;war of aggression&quot; and considered the United States a &quot;belligerent&quot; power, despite having elevated relations with Washington to the highest diplomatic level just a year earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The internal military document was issued by Vietnam&#39;s Navy under the Ministry of Defense on August 1, 2024, entitled &quot;The 2nd US Invasion Plan (357/KH-BTL),&quot; which was signed by Vice Admiral Tran Thanh Nghiem and certified by Rear Admiral Vu Van Nam. The document confirms a deep-seated fear of external forces fomenting an uprising against the Communist leadership in a so-called &quot;color revolution,&quot; like the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, or the 1986 Yellow Revolution in the Philippines.</p>
<p>While the document states that &quot;there is currently little risk of a war against Vietnam,&quot; it does note that &quot;due to the U.S.&#39;s belligerent nature, we need to be vigilant to prevent the U.S. and its allies from &#39;creating a pretext&#39; to launch a war of aggression against our country.&quot; The disclosure highlights what analysts describe as a dual-track approach in Vietnam&#39;s foreign policy: outward diplomatic engagement alongside persistent internal suspicion. A year after Vietnam elevated its relations with Washington to the highest diplomatic level, the revelation of military planning documents targeting potential American military action underscores the complexity of U.S.-Vietnam relations.</p>
<p>The document&#39;s existence became public through reports in early February 2026, sparking debate among regional security analysts about the implications for U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia. Analysts note that Vietnam&#39;s Communist Party leadership maintains deep-rooted concerns about Western influence on its political system, even as it pursues economic and security cooperation with the United States as a counterweight to Chinese regional dominance. The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-Asian relations, with the Trump administration seeking to strengthen security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region while navigating complex historical legacies and ideological differences with communist-governed states.</p>
<h3>7. Nigerian Gunmen Kill Three and Kidnap Catholic Priest in Kaduna State Attack</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-07.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gunmen killed three villagers and abducted 11 people, including a Catholic priest, during a predawn attack in northwest Nigeria on February 7, marking the latest in a cycle of violence that has surged in the conflict-battered north of the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The incident occurred in Karku community of Kauru Local Government Area in the early hours of Saturday at about 3:20 am (WAT), at the priest&#39;s residence. The abducted priest is Rev. Fr. Nathaniel Asuwaye of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Karku. Three residents lost their lives in the attack, named as Mr. Jacob Dan&#39;azumi, Mr. Maitala Kaura, and Alhaji Kusari. The assault was described as &quot;an act of invasion by a group of terrorists&quot; by Catholic officials and local authorities.</p>
<p>The attack is the latest in a cycle of violence that has surged in the conflict-battered north of Nigeria, where armed groups—including bandits, kidnappers, and jihadist militants—operate across multiple states with varying degrees of organization and ideological motivation. Northwest Nigeria has experienced a dramatic increase in kidnappings for ransom over the past several years, with criminal gangs targeting schools, churches, travelers, and individual households. The region&#39;s security crisis has been compounded by ethnic tensions, competition over scarce resources, and the proliferation of small arms.</p>
<p>Nigeria&#39;s security forces have struggled to contain the violence despite military operations and the designation of bandit groups as terrorists. Religious leaders have called for greater government action to protect vulnerable communities, with Catholic bishops expressing particular concern about attacks targeting clergy and worshippers. The kidnapping of priests has become increasingly common in Nigeria&#39;s northwest and north-central regions, with criminal groups viewing clergy as valuable targets for ransom demands, knowing that religious communities and international Catholic organizations may be willing to pay for their release.</p>
<h3>8. Amsterdam and Florence Ban Fossil Fuel Advertising in Public Spaces</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-08.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Jan-Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amsterdam and Florence became the latest cities to ban fossil fuel advertising in public spaces, with Amsterdam&#39;s city council passing a legally binding ban on January 22 that will prohibit advertising for air travel, cruises, petrol-powered cars, and meat products starting May 1, 2026, making it the first capital in the world to enact such comprehensive restrictions through local law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amsterdam city council approved a bid by green political party GroenLinks and animal welfare party Partij voor de Dieren to ban fossil fuel and meat adverts in public spaces and on the city&#39;s public transport network. The measure will prohibit advertising for air travel, cruises, and petrol-powered cars, with the official start date of the regulation set for May 1, 2026. Companies that go against the new law could face fines of between €20,000 and €100,000, with repeat offenders paying double the amount.</p>
<p>Florence followed suit in early February 2026, becoming the first Italian city to adopt a ban on fossil fuel advertising in public spaces in an 18-3 vote. A motion passed in Florence means it will soon become the first Italian city to ban fossil fuel advertising in public spaces, targeting ads for flights, cruises, fossil energy contracts, and cars. Both cities are part of a broader global trend, as over 50 cities, mostly European, have either restricted such ads in specific areas or tabled motions to introduce formal limitations.</p>
<p>Several Dutch municipalities, Stockholm, Edinburgh, and Sydney have banned fossil fuel advertising altogether, representing a growing movement among urban governments to use advertising regulations as a climate policy tool. Environmental advocates argue that fossil fuel advertising normalizes high-carbon lifestyles and undermines efforts to meet Paris Agreement climate targets, while industry groups contend that advertising bans represent government overreach and may violate commercial free speech protections. The Amsterdam and Florence decisions are likely to inspire similar efforts in other European cities, potentially creating a patchwork of local advertising restrictions that could complicate marketing campaigns for airlines, automotive companies, and energy providers across the continent.</p>
<h3>9. Munich Security Conference Set to Address Transatlantic Divisions and Global Security</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-09.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 13-15</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 62nd Munich Security Conference will take place from February 13 to 15, 2026, assembling more than 450 senior decision-makers to debate pressing issues of international security policy at a fundamental inflection point, with longstanding alliances called into question and mounting instability across the globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During its main conference in February, the MSC assembles more than 450 senior decision-makers as well as thought leaders from around the world, including heads of state, ministers, leading personalities of international and non-governmental organizations, high-ranking representatives from business, the media, academia, and civil society to debate pressing issues of international security policy. Topics addressed at the MSC 2026 will include European security and defense, the future of the transatlantic relationship, the revitalization of multilateralism, competing visions of the global order, regional conflicts, and the security implications of technological advances.</p>
<p>With longstanding alliances called into question, the rules-based international order eroding, and mounting instability and escalating conflicts across the globe, this year&#39;s Munich Security Conference takes place at a fundamental inflection point. The 2026 edition is expected to bring back echoes of 2025, when US Vice President JD Vance signaled the breakdown of the transatlantic consensus on the war in Ukraine and the conceptual abyss that separates the new Trump administration from European allies.</p>
<p>The MSC kick-off will take place on February 9, 2026, and the next Munich Security Report will be released ahead of the 62nd Munich Security Conference on the same day. European leaders are expected to use the forum to discuss strategies for managing relations with the Trump administration, coordinating responses to Russian aggression, addressing the challenges posed by China&#39;s rise, and strengthening European defense capabilities. The conference comes at a moment when traditional assumptions about American security commitments to Europe are being questioned, forcing European nations to contemplate greater strategic autonomy while navigating complex dependencies on U.S. military power and intelligence capabilities.</p>
<h3>10. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Halts Trading in China-Linked Ramp-and-Dump Stocks</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-10.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SEC has halted trading in suspected ramp-and-dump stocks with potential China links as SEC Chairman Paul Atkins launches a crackdown to protect U.S. investors, with the agency announcing enforcement actions against nearly a dozen Chinese companies showing &quot;indications of manipulative behavior.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has announced enforcement actions against stocks it suspects are involved in &quot;pump-and-dump&quot; or &quot;ramp-and-dump&quot; schemes tied to foreign-based companies, including entities with operations in China. Atkins noted that the problematic companies are &quot;small, kind of penny stocks on Nasdaq,&quot; particularly East Asian and China-related companies. The SEC has identified nearly a dozen Chinese companies that showed &quot;indications of manipulative behavior&quot; and involvement with &quot;ramp-and-dump&quot; schemes.</p>
<p>Atkins stated: &quot;We have really good folks who are monitoring the markets and looking at the data that we collect … and then we&#39;re taking steps to shut down the trading before investors can get hurt.&quot; The action represents part of Atkins&#39; broader effort to tighten SEC scrutiny of Chinese firms trading on U.S. exchanges, with the chairman saying the agency is reassessing exemptions for foreign private issuers, particularly Chinese firms operating in China but incorporated offshore.</p>
<p>The crackdown comes amid growing bipartisan pressure in Washington to address concerns about Chinese companies accessing U.S. capital markets without meeting the same disclosure and audit requirements as domestic firms. Congressional leaders have been pushing for stricter enforcement of existing rules and consideration of legislation that would mandate delisting of Chinese firms that fail to comply with U.S. auditing standards. The SEC&#39;s actions signal a shift toward more aggressive oversight of foreign issuers, particularly those from jurisdictions where regulatory cooperation has been limited or where national security concerns about financial flows have been raised by intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Salesforce and ServiceNow tumbled nearly 7% in a single session this week, pushing ServiceNow&#39;s year-to-date losses to 28% and Salesforce&#39;s 2026 decline to almost 26%. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund has plummeted about 20% so far in 2026, including a 6.5% drop during the first week of February. &quot;I could tell you in 25 years, this structural sell-off in software is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, highlighting the unprecedented nature of the sector&#39;s decline.</p>
<p>The most important reason for the sell-off is the ongoing fear that these companies will be disrupted by AI tools, especially those made by Anthropic. A selloff in global providers of data analytics, professional services, and software deepened after Anthropic launched plug-ins for the Claude Cowork agent on Friday—automating legal work like reviewing contracts, non-disclosure agreement triage, and compliance workflows. Investors fear that agentic AI capabilities could replace significant portions of the workflow automation, data management, and analytics services that have been the bread and butter of enterprise software companies.</p>
<p>Software stocks have also plunged because of their valuations, which surged in the past few years, with companies like Adobe and ServiceNow going through a valuation reset. Among the worst performers in software ETFs so far this year are Intuit, a maker of tax preparation software, and DocuSign, which handles PDFs and other documents, with both down more than 30% as investors question whether AI agents will replace their core offerings. The sector&#39;s struggles reflect a broader reckoning about which software companies can successfully integrate AI into their products versus those whose entire business models may be rendered obsolete by advancing AI capabilities.</p>
<h3>2. Tech-to-Value Rotation Accelerates as &quot;Old Economy&quot; Sectors Outperform AI Giants</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-12.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. stock market is witnessing a massive sector rotation as billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into &quot;Old Economy&quot; value sectors of basic materials, energy, and industrials, with small-cap value stocks up 5.94% in 2026 compared to large-cap growth at 2.80%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. stock market is currently witnessing a tectonic shift in capital allocation as the &quot;AI hype cycle&quot; of the early 2020s gives way to the &quot;Physical Reality&quot; of 2026, with a massive sector rotation seeing billions of dollars exit high-multiple SaaS and AI growth stocks, flowing instead into &quot;Old Economy&quot; value sectors of Basic Materials, Energy, and Industrials. While it&#39;s only a few weeks into 2026, the latest data shows that the tables are turning in the stock market, with small-cap companies outpacing large caps in an early reversal of last year&#39;s dynamic.</p>
<p>There&#39;s ongoing internal rotation within the market—some sectors (energy, materials, industrials, staples) are strong, while tech, consumer discretionary, and real estate lag. Investment firm Asbury&#39;s SEAF model currently favors industrials, materials, and energy, emphasizing defensive and cyclical sectors. Additionally, XLP (staples/defensive stocks) has outperformed XLY (consumer discretionary) since January 7th, with staples outperforming discretionary by 19%, signaling investors are rotating into safer, more defensive positions.</p>
<p>The AI boom of 2023–2025 focused on the models; the rotation of 2026 is focused on the power, the metal, and the machinery, mirroring the post-Dotcom era where after the collapse of speculative tech, the market spent years rewarding the companies that built the physical internet and global trade routes. Several sectors hit fresh all-time highs this week, such as industrials, materials, energy, and consumer staples, representing a shift from the tech-dominated gains of previous years. Wall Street&#39;s rotation into value has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bust, with analysts warning that the parallels—while not exact—suggest investors are reassessing which companies have sustainable business models versus those built primarily on growth narratives.</p>
<h3>3. Nvidia Rebounds 8% as CEO Huang Declares AI Demand &quot;Sky High&quot; in CNBC Interview</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-13.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6-7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nvidia shares surged more than 8% on Friday, February 7, after CEO Jensen Huang appeared on CNBC&#39;s Squawk Box declaring that demand for AI is &quot;just incredibly high&quot; and describing the current moment as a definitive &quot;inflection point&quot; where AI shifts from experimental curiosity to fundamental utility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jensen Huang told CNBC that demand for AI is &quot;just incredibly high,&quot; stating that &quot;the demand for Blackwell and our upcoming Vera Rubin platform is sky-high as nations and corporations realize that compute power is the new natural resource.&quot; Huang described the current moment as a definitive &quot;inflection point,&quot; where AI is shifting from an experimental curiosity into a fundamental utility for every industry. Huang stated during the interview: &quot;We are witnessing the largest infrastructure buildout in human history.&quot;</p>
<p>Huang said that the level of AI expenditures is appropriate and sustainable, and that the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure will continue for seven to eight years. Regarding compute constraints, Huang noted: &quot;These guys are so compute-constrained, and demand is so incredibly great,&quot; referring to AI companies like Anthropic and OpenAI. Huang also defended the massive capital spending by hyperscalers, arguing that companies investing in AI infrastructure are making rational decisions that will pay off over the next decade.</p>
<p>Following the interview, shares of Nvidia surged more than 8%, contributing significantly to the broader market rally that propelled the Dow past the 50,000 milestone. The stock&#39;s performance helped provide a counterpoint to concerns about AI spending raised by Amazon and Alphabet&#39;s massive capex plans announced earlier in the week. Huang&#39;s bullish comments reassured investors that the AI infrastructure buildout has substantial runway remaining, supporting the thesis that semiconductor companies and infrastructure providers will continue to benefit even as questions mount about the returns for those doing the spending.</p>
<h3>4. Consumer Sentiment Rises as Inflation Expectations Fall to Lowest Level Since January 2025</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-14.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of Michigan&#39;s consumer sentiment index rose to 57.3 in February 2026, beating market expectations of 55, while year-ahead inflation expectations fell sharply to 3.5% from 4.0%—the lowest level since January 2025—though sentiment remained roughly 20% below its level from a year earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The University of Michigan&#39;s consumer sentiment index rose by 0.9 points to 57.3 in February 2026, marking a third consecutive monthly increase and beating market expectations of 55. However, sentiment remained roughly 20% below its level in January 2025, reflecting persistent consumer anxiety about the economic outlook. The gains were driven largely by consumers with significant stock holdings, while sentiment among households without equity exposure stagnated at depressed levels.</p>
<p>Year-ahead inflation expectations fell sharply to 3.5% from 4.0% in January, the lowest level since January 2025, representing a significant improvement in near-term inflation psychology. However, longer-term inflation expectations edged up for a second month to 3.4% from 3.3%, suggesting consumers remain concerned about sustained price pressures beyond the immediate term. Concerns over the erosion of household finances due to high prices and the risk of job losses remain widespread, particularly among lower- and middle-income households.</p>
<p>The decline in near-term inflation expectations provided a boost to market sentiment on Friday, contributing to the broad rally that saw the Dow cross 50,000 for the first time. Treasury yields moved lower on the report, as investors interpreted the combination of moderating inflation expectations and still-subdued consumer confidence as supportive of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in the year. However, the bifurcation in sentiment between stock-owning households and those without equity exposure underscores the uneven nature of the economic recovery and ongoing wealth inequality concerns.</p>
<h3>5. Treasury Yields Slide as Weak Jobs Data Raises Recession Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-15.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5-7</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.198% and the 30-year Treasury yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4.852% as investors reacted to weaker labor market data, with initial jobless claims hitting 231,000—well above expectations—and job openings falling to the lowest level since September 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.198%, and the 30-year Treasury yield was more than 6 basis points lower at 4.852%, with yields moving lower as investors reacted to weaker labor market data. Initial jobless claims for the week ended January 31 came in at 231,000, increasing by 22,000 from the prior weekly period and well above the 212,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had expected, raising concerns about labor market deterioration.</p>
<p>Job openings in December dropped to 6.54 million from the downwardly revised 6.93 million seen in November, and that new figure is the lowest level for job openings since September 2020. Additionally, the ADP report for January showed that private companies added only 22,000 positions last month, less than the 37,000 increase in December, reflecting a lackluster job market. The run of weaker labor data reinforced bets on multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, with markets still pricing in a first reduction in June and a second potentially in September.</p>
<p>The weak employment data contributed to the broader market selloff earlier in the week, raising questions about the strength of the economic expansion. However, Friday&#39;s strong rally suggested that investors are viewing the softening labor market as increasing the likelihood of Fed rate cuts rather than signaling an imminent recession. The bond market&#39;s reaction reflects the delicate balancing act the Federal Reserve faces: labor market weakness that justifies rate cuts versus persistent inflation concerns that argue for maintaining restrictive monetary policy.</p>
<h3>6. Oil Prices Hold Near $60 as OPEC+ Maintains Cuts Through March Amid Oversupply Concerns</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-16.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brent crude oil futures traded near $60.87 per barrel while WTI remained at $57.46 as OPEC+ agreed to maintain voluntary production cuts through March 2026, with the EIA forecasting Brent will average $56 per barrel in 2026—19% less than 2025—as global production exceeds demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brent Oil Futures expiring in March were nearly unchanged at $60.87 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $57.46 per barrel. The American Petroleum Institute reported a decline of 11.1 million barrels bringing stockpiles to 420.3 million barrels for the week ending February 4, representing a significant inventory drawdown that provided some support to prices.</p>
<p>The eight key member countries of the OPEC+ alliance, namely Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, met virtually on February 1 and agreed to maintain their current voluntary oil production cuts through March 2026. OPEC+ kept voluntary output cuts in place through March 2026 while reaffirming flexibility to adjust production levels in response to market conditions. The decision reflects the alliance&#39;s concern about weak demand growth and rising non-OPEC production, particularly from the United States and other non-member producers.</p>
<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts the Brent crude oil price will average $56 per barrel in 2026, 19% less than in 2025, as global oil production exceeds global oil demand, causing oil inventories to rise. The consensus among leading analysts is that the market will be oversupplied in 2026, with the IEA seeing an implied oversupply of 3.8 million barrels per day due to weak demand. Global liquid fuels production growth in 2026 is driven by crude oil production growth in OPEC+ and increased output from U.S. shale producers, despite the cartel&#39;s efforts to support prices through supply management.</p>
<h3>7. Trump Argentina Beef Import Expansion Sparks Cattle Industry Backlash</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-17.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on February 6 temporarily quadrupling imports of lean beef trimmings from Argentina under the U.S. tariff-rate quota, authorizing an 80,000 metric ton increase for 2026 to address supply shortages and ease consumer costs, drawing pushback from the cattle industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on February 6, 2026, temporarily quadrupling imports of lean beef trimmings from Argentina under the U.S. tariff-rate quota (TRQ). The proclamation authorizes an 80,000 metric ton increase in in-quota lean beef trimmings imports for 2026, which will be allocated entirely to Argentina. The additional beef will be distributed in four quarterly tranches of 20,000 metric tons each, beginning February 13, 2026, and continuing through the end of the year.</p>
<p>Trump expanded beef imports from Argentina by 80,000 metric tons in 2026 to address supply shortages and ease costs for consumers amid cattle crises. U.S. consumers have seen beef prices climb steadily in recent years, with ground beef reaching an average price of $6.69 per pound in December 2025, which was the highest level recorded since the 1980s. The administration framed the action as necessary to provide relief to American consumers facing historically high meat prices.</p>
<p>The announcement drew pushback from the nation&#39;s largest cattle industry group, which questioned whether increased imports would deliver the price relief the administration is promising. Industry representatives argued that the import expansion could depress domestic cattle prices and undermine American ranchers who are already struggling with drought conditions, high feed costs, and reduced herd sizes. The controversy highlights the tension between the administration&#39;s desire to address consumer inflation concerns and its support for domestic agricultural producers, with critics arguing that the policy prioritizes short-term price relief over long-term industry sustainability.</p>
<h3>8. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings on Weight Loss Drug Boom</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-18.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, exceeding analyst expectations as demand for blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars, with the pharmaceutical giant projecting 2026 revenue between $80 billion and $83 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue and 2026 guidance that blew past estimates, as demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, a year earlier, representing a 51% increase in earnings per share year-over-year.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly anticipates its 2026 revenue will come in between $80 billion and $83 billion, representing continued strong growth driven primarily by GLP-1 medications used for weight loss and diabetes management. The company also projects adjusted earnings to be between $33.50 and $35 per share for the year, significantly above Wall Street consensus estimates prior to the earnings release. The guidance reflects management&#39;s confidence that supply constraints that limited sales in 2025 have largely been resolved and that demand remains robust across both U.S. and international markets.</p>
<p>The blowout results underscore how weight loss drugs have become one of the most lucrative pharmaceutical categories in history, with Eli Lilly and competitor Novo Nordisk capturing the majority of a market that analysts project could exceed $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. The success of Zepbound (tirzepatide) for weight loss and Mounjaro for diabetes has transformed Eli Lilly&#39;s financial profile, with the drugs contributing tens of billions in annual revenue and driving the company&#39;s stock to record highs despite concerns about potential insurance coverage limitations and the long-term sustainability of premium pricing.</p>
<h3>9. Pfizer Beats Estimates Despite Declining COVID Revenue, Reaffirms Modest 2026 Outlook</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-19.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pfizer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped estimates even amid dwindling demand for its Covid products, with the company expecting 2026 revenue to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion—largely flat compared with 2025—as it navigates patent expirations and declining pandemic-related sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pfizer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped estimates even amid dwindling demand for its Covid products. For 2026 guidance, Pfizer expects 2026 adjusted profit to come in between $2.80 and $3 per share, and revenue to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. Those sales would largely be flat compared with 2025 revenue, representing a stark contrast to the company&#39;s pandemic-era growth trajectory when COVID-19 vaccines and treatments drove record revenues.</p>
<p>The company expects declining sales of its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid to fall by about $1.5 billion year over year to $5 billion in 2026. Pfizer also pointed to another roughly $1.5 billion year-over-year expected drop in sales due to certain products losing their market exclusivity, reflecting the ongoing challenge of patent cliffs facing large pharmaceutical companies. The dual headwinds of declining COVID revenues and patent expirations are forcing Pfizer to rely more heavily on newer products and its pipeline to drive future growth.</p>
<p>Despite the modest outlook, Pfizer&#39;s ability to beat fourth-quarter estimates provided some reassurance to investors that the company is successfully managing the transition away from COVID-driven revenues. The pharmaceutical giant is investing heavily in cancer drugs, obesity treatments, and other therapeutic areas to offset declining sales from older products. However, the flat revenue guidance for 2026 highlights the significant challenges Pfizer faces in returning to sustained growth after the extraordinary but temporary boost provided by pandemic-related products.</p>
<h3>10. Walmart CEO Transition Set for February as Retail Giant Maintains Strong Guidance</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/daily/story-20.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 1-2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon&#39;s retirement is scheduled for February 2026, with John Furner, the CEO of Walmart&#39;s U.S. business, set to succeed him on February 1 as the retail giant maintains expectations for full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1% despite consumer spending headwinds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CEO Doug McMillon&#39;s retirement is scheduled for February 2026, with John Furner, the CEO of Walmart&#39;s U.S. business, set to succeed him on February 1. The leadership transition comes as Walmart expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1%, up from its previous expectations of 3.75% to 4.75%, reflecting the company&#39;s continued strong performance in capturing market share across income demographics. The company expects its adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63, a slight raise from previous guidance.</p>
<p>Walmart beat Wall Street expectations in its most recent quarter with strong food and health sales driving 6% revenue growth to $179.5 billion. Online sales jumped 28%, marking the company&#39;s seventh straight quarter of more than 20% e-commerce growth and underscoring the success of Walmart&#39;s omnichannel strategy. The consumer landscape is increasingly prioritizing value and convenience, with Walmart&#39;s strategic investments in omnichannel capabilities and e-commerce positioning it as a dominant force capable of attracting a diverse customer base, including a notable influx of higher-income households seeking affordability.</p>
<p>However, there has been some moderation in spending in the low-income cohort, consistent with macro perspectives, and in October, the disparity in wage growth between income cohorts was as large as it&#39;s been in almost a decade. The bifurcation in consumer behavior—with higher-income consumers trading down to Walmart while lower-income consumers struggle—highlights the uneven economic recovery and the challenges facing many American households despite overall economic growth. The CEO transition at such a critical juncture underscores the importance of maintaining strategic continuity while adapting to evolving retail dynamics and competitive pressures from both traditional rivals and e-commerce competitors.</p>

<h3>1. Russia Launches Largest Aerial Assault of 2026 on Ukraine Energy Infrastructure</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-01.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia launched 71 missiles and 450 drones against Ukrainian power facilities in the most devastating energy attack of the year, leaving hundreds of thousands without heat during subzero temperatures immediately after a Trump-brokered energy truce expired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attack came just hours after the expiration of a brief pause in strikes on energy infrastructure that both Moscow and Kyiv had agreed to at the request of President Trump. Ukrainian President Zelensky accused Russia of using the pause not for diplomatic purposes but to stockpile missiles, then striking deliberately on the coldest days of the year when temperatures plunged to -20°C across much of the country.</p>
<p>DTEK, Ukraine&#39;s largest private energy provider, described the February 3 assault as &quot;the most severe&quot; since the start of 2026. More than 1,170 high-rise buildings in Kyiv lost heating, while a power plant in Kharkiv was damaged beyond repair, leaving 300,000 residents without electricity. In Odesa, over 50,000 people lost power as temperatures remained dangerously cold.</p>
<p>Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 38 missiles and 412 drones, but the strikes that got through caused catastrophic damage. DTEK&#39;s CEO noted that Ukraine has now lost approximately 70% of its generation capacity, with many civilians receiving only 3-4 hours of electricity daily. The energy crisis has driven an estimated 600,000 people to leave Kyiv since the war began.</p>
<h3>2. SpaceX Blocks Russian Forces&#39; Unauthorized Starlink Access After Ukraine&#39;s Plea</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-02.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX deactivated Starlink internet terminals used by Russian military forces in Ukraine after Kyiv provided evidence of &quot;hundreds&quot; of drone attacks guided by the satellite system, with Russian military bloggers confirming widespread outages across the front lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ukraine&#39;s defense ministry launched a verification of all Starlink terminals operating in the country after discovering that Moscow troops had been mounting Starlink systems on attack drones to strike deeper into Ukrainian territory. The unauthorized use began in September 2024, with the Rubikon company equipping Molniya strike drones with Starlink systems starting December 2025.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials created a &quot;white list&quot; of verified Starlink terminals used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and sent them to SpaceX, requesting that Musk keep these operational while shutting down all others in the theater. Pro-Russian military bloggers confirmed sweeping outages that weakened Moscow&#39;s ability to wage drone warfare and hindered coordination between units.</p>
<p>Musk responded on X that SpaceX&#39;s efforts to halt &quot;unauthorized&quot; Russian use appeared successful, posting &quot;Let us know if more needs to be done.&quot; The Ukrainian Defense Ministry confirmed that Russian terminals had been &quot;cut off,&quot; representing a significant blow to Russia&#39;s drone warfare capabilities just as it launched its largest aerial assault of the year.</p>
<h3>3. US-India Announce Landmark Trade Deal, Reducing Tariffs from 50% to 18%</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-03.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump announced a breakthrough trade agreement with India, immediately reducing tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% after Prime Minister Modi agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and commit to over $500 billion in American purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deal ended a year-long tariff standoff between the two nations, with Trump also dropping the separate 25% tariff imposed over India&#39;s Russian oil imports. Under the agreement, India pledged to eliminate tariffs on American industrial goods while being allowed to maintain protections for its agricultural sector. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal called it &quot;the father of all deals.&quot;</p>
<p>Indian markets surged on the news, with the Nifty 50 jumping nearly 5% and the rupee strengthening to 90.40—its best day since November 2022. Twenty-seven of 30 Sensex stocks traded positive as trade war fears eased. The 18% US tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors in the battle for American market access.</p>
<p>However, analysts cautioned that legally binding text has yet to materialize. Prime Minister Modi notably did not mention the Russian oil commitment or tariff elimination in his public response to Trump&#39;s announcement, raising questions about how the deal will be implemented and whether it can withstand political scrutiny in both countries.</p>
<h3>4. Australia and Indonesia Sign Historic Security Treaty for Defense Cooperation</h3>
<audio class="story-audio" controls src="audio/weekly-news/story-04.mp3"></audio>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Australia and Indonesia signed a comprehensive security treaty establishing new military training facilities and closer defense cooperation, as Southeast Asia&#39;s largest economy aligns more closely with its southern neighbor amid rising great power competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed the agreement as &quot;a historic moment in our nations&#39; relationship,&quot; building upon a 2024 defense pact that pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region. The treaty creates a framework for joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and the development of training facilities in Indonesian territory.</p>
<p>The agreement comes as both nations navigate increasingly complex security dynamics, with China&#39;s military assertiveness in the South China Sea and the shifting priorities of the United States under President Trump creating pressure for regional powers to strengthen bilateral ties. Indonesia&#39;s strategic location straddling major shipping lanes makes the partnership particularly significant.</p>
<p>The treaty represents a significant warming of relations that were strained in previous decades over issues including East Timor and asylum seekers. Defense analysts note the agreement signals Indonesia&#39;s willingness to engage more deeply with traditional Western security partners while maintaining its non-aligned foreign policy stance, balancing relationships with both Washington and Beijing.</p>
<h3>5. Trump Administration Moves to Strip Job Protections from 50,000 Federal Workers</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management issued a final rule creating a new employment classification that will remove civil service protections from an estimated 50,000 &quot;policy-influencing&quot; federal employees, making them at-will workers who can be fired at the president&#39;s discretion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the &quot;Schedule Policy/Career&quot; classification, reclassified employees will lose the ability to appeal disciplinary actions, suspensions, demotions, or firings to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Starting March 9, these employees could be converted to at-will status at Trump&#39;s discretion, representing the most significant restructuring of federal employment since the civil service system was established.</p>
<p>The proposal received over 40,000 public comments during its 45-day comment period, with approximately 94% opposing the regulation. Unions representing federal workers condemned the move as an attempt to politicize the civil service and create a workforce loyal to the president rather than to their professional responsibilities and the public interest.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management data shows that 242,260 employees have left the federal workforce—voluntarily or involuntarily—since Trump took office for his second term. Combined with the earlier DOGE initiative that reduced the federal civilian workforce by 9% in 2025, the administration has achieved the most dramatic reduction in government employment since World War II.</p>
<h3>6. Xi Jinping and Trump Hold Phone Call, Discussing Taiwan and Trade Ahead of Summit</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Xi Jinping emphasized that Taiwan is &quot;the most important issue in China-U.S. relations&quot; during a phone call with President Trump, as the two leaders discussed trade tensions and geopolitical flashpoints ahead of a planned face-to-face meeting in April.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The call came after Xi held a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Putin confirmed plans to visit China in the first half of 2026. The timing highlighted Beijing&#39;s careful balancing act between maintaining its strategic partnership with Moscow while managing the increasingly complex relationship with Washington under Trump&#39;s trade-focused foreign policy.</p>
<p>Xi noted that over the past year the two countries have enjoyed sound communication following their successful meeting in Busan, which charted the direction for China-U.S. relations. However, he made clear that Taiwan remains a red line, declaring that &quot;Taiwan is China&#39;s territory&quot; and any American actions regarding the island could fundamentally damage bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The planned April summit will be closely watched for signs of progress on trade issues, particularly as Trump&#39;s tariff threats against allies and adversaries alike have created uncertainty in global markets. Western leaders including Canada&#39;s Prime Minister Mark Carney, the UK&#39;s Keir Starmer, and Germany&#39;s Friedrich Merz have all visited or plan to visit Beijing, reflecting China&#39;s central role in global economic and security calculations.</p>
<h3>7. ASEAN Refuses to Recognize Myanmar&#39;s Junta-Led Elections</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations issued a formal statement rejecting the legitimacy of elections held in Myanmar, marking a significant escalation in regional pressure on the military junta as the country approaches five years since the February 2021 coup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The elections, held in December 2025 and January 2026, were designed to provide a &quot;controlled veneer of legitimacy&quot; for the military government, according to analysts. However, the junta remains unable to assert full authority across the country, with resistance forces controlling significant territory and ongoing armed conflict preventing voting in many regions.</p>
<p>Myanmar, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, remains among the countries most susceptible to major civil unrest in Asia through 2026, according to intelligence assessments. Economic hardship, inflation, and widespread corruption continue to fuel protests, while armed resistance groups have made significant territorial gains against the military.</p>
<p>The media landscape in Myanmar continues to deteriorate as the nation approaches the fifth anniversary of the coup. New legislation across South Korea, Australia, and Indonesia affecting press freedom has drawn regional attention, while journalists in Myanmar face ongoing persecution, arbitrary detention, and violence for reporting on the conflict.</p>
<h3>8. Bangladesh Heads to Polls After Two Years of Political Upheaval</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bangladeshis are set to vote on February 12 in national elections that will determine the country&#39;s direction nearly two years after the July Uprising of 2024 that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a violent popular revolt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Islamic conservative party Jamaat-e-Islami announced it would maintain &quot;constructive and cooperative&quot; relations with neighboring countries including India as part of its election platform. The party&#39;s outreach to New Delhi represents an attempt to reassure regional powers concerned about political instability in the densely populated nation of 170 million.</p>
<p>The elections come amid continued civil unrest that intelligence analysts predict will persist into 2026. Economic hardship, inflation, and public anger over widespread corruption drove the protests that toppled Hasina&#39;s government, and these underlying conditions remain largely unaddressed nearly two years later.</p>
<p>Bangladesh&#39;s relationship with India has been strained since the 2024 uprising, with concerns in New Delhi about the treatment of Hindu minorities and the rise of Islamic political movements. The election results will significantly impact India&#39;s eastern security calculus and the broader dynamics of South Asian geopolitics.</p>
<h3>9. Trump Abandons Greenland Tariff Threats After European Backlash</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Trump canceled threatened tariffs on eight European nations that were scheduled to take effect on February 1, backing away from his demand that Denmark sell Greenland to the United States after the crisis sparked a significant deterioration in European public opinion of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump had initially announced a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, with threats to increase duties to 25% by June 1 unless Denmark agreed to cede Greenland. At the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, Trump reversed his position, pledging not to use force or tariffs to acquire the autonomous territory.</p>
<p>The crisis prompted Denmark to deploy hundreds of elite combat soldiers trained in arctic warfare to Greenland, including the Chief of the Royal Danish Army. A YouGov poll from February 2026 showed the standoff led to a significant increase in unfavorable views of the United States across Western Europe, potentially complicating future diplomatic initiatives.</p>
<p>Despite the de-escalation, Trump&#39;s broader tariff agenda continues to reshape transatlantic relations. The administration maintains 10% tariffs on European goods that took effect February 1 under separate trade disputes, with threats of further escalation if trade imbalances are not addressed to Washington&#39;s satisfaction.</p>
<h3>10. Ethiopia and Kenya Launch Joint Defense Committee Amid Regional Security Cooperation</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethiopia and Kenya concluded the inaugural meeting of their Joint Defence Committee, institutionalizing bilateral defense cooperation as the two nations emerge as primary drivers of East Africa&#39;s economic and security architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three-day meeting in Nairobi followed the signing of a Defense Cooperation Agreement that established a framework for coordinating military relations between the neighboring countries. The partnership aims to address shared security threats including terrorism, border instability, and the spillover effects of conflicts in Somalia and Sudan.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is positioning itself as Africa&#39;s &quot;green powerhouse,&quot; generating over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources through decades of investment in hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal infrastructure. Surplus electricity from large hydropower stations is increasingly exported to Kenya and Sudan under regional power trade agreements, strengthening economic interdependence.</p>
<p>The UN projects Ethiopia and Kenya will be the main drivers of East Africa&#39;s economic expansion in 2026, with the region&#39;s economy expected to grow by 5.8%—up from 5.4% in 2025—outperforming all other African sub-regions. This economic dynamism is enabling both countries to invest more heavily in defense and regional security initiatives.</p>
<h3>11. DRC Peace Process Launched with Former African Leaders as Facilitators</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>African nations appointed former Kenya president Uhuru Kenyatta, former Ethiopia prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and former Nigeria president Olusegun Obasanjo as facilitators of a new peace process for the Democratic Republic of Congo, as fighting continues in the mineral-rich east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appointment of the elder statesmen comes as Rwanda&#39;s President Kagame continues to defy international pressure over the DRC conflict, with the M23 rebel group—widely understood to receive Rwandan backing—controlling significant territory including the Rubaya coltan mines that produce 15% of the world&#39;s supply of the critical mineral used in electronics.</p>
<p>Kenya faces its own humanitarian crisis as a deepening drought pushes pastoralist families to the brink, with livestock losses spreading across the arid north. The dual crises of conflict in the DRC and climate-related disasters across the Horn of Africa are straining regional resources and diplomatic bandwidth.</p>
<p>The new peace process faces significant obstacles, as previous initiatives have failed to address the fundamental drivers of conflict: control over mineral wealth, ethnic tensions, and the competing interests of regional powers. The facilitators must navigate these challenges while managing pressure from Western nations and China, both of which have significant economic interests in the DRC&#39;s mineral sector.</p>
<h3>12. Super Bowl LX Set for Sunday as Seahawks Face Patriots in Epic Rematch</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare to face off at Levi&#39;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday in a Super Bowl rematch of their legendary 2015 clash, with both teams having finished the season at 14-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NFL Honors ceremony on Thursday announced Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford as the league&#39;s Most Valuable Player, while the 2026 Hall of Fame class was revealed: Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly, Adam Vinatieri, and Roger Craig. The class includes three of the NFL&#39;s all-time greats at their positions.</p>
<p>Seattle enters as 4.5-point favorites, with quarterback Sam Darnold and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba leading an explosive offense. Bad Bunny will headline the halftime show, with Charlie Puth performing the national anthem and Green Day opening the ceremony. Brandi Carlile will sing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and Coco Jones will perform &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing.&quot;</p>
<p>The game carries enormous stakes for both franchises. A Seahawks victory would help erase the bitter memory of Malcolm Butler&#39;s game-winning interception at the goal line in Super Bowl XLIX. For New England, a win would mark the Patriots&#39; seventh championship and validate the team&#39;s complete rebuild since Tom Brady&#39;s departure.</p>
<h3>13. European Leaders Face Mounting Unpopularity as Reform Agendas Stall</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>France, Germany, and the United Kingdom entered 2026 with historically unpopular governments, with polling showing just 18% of Britons viewing Keir Starmer favorably and only 16% of French respondents holding a positive view of Emmanuel Macron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Germany&#39;s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in May 2025 after February&#39;s snap election, began his term with just 38% approval—which had fallen to 32% by December. His coalition faces pressure from five upcoming state elections where the far-right Alternative for Germany is expected to gain seats, limiting his ability to pursue controversial reforms.</p>
<p>France entered 2026 for the second consecutive year without an approved budget after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu&#39;s minority government collapsed under pressure from both left and right. A new budget agreement is expected by late February or March, but the political paralysis has limited the government&#39;s ability to respond to economic challenges or the Trump administration&#39;s trade demands.</p>
<p>In the UK, domestic pressure grows on Starmer to pursue closer economic integration with the European Union, including potentially joining the customs union. However, official talks between London and Brussels have gone nowhere, leaving Britain isolated between an uninterested Europe and a Trump administration focused on bilateral trade confrontation.</p>
<h3>14. Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana to Lead Latin American Oil Production Surge</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latin America&#39;s three emerging oil powers—Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana—are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing a potential 300,000 bpd contribution from Venezuela as the region reshapes global energy markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brazil leads the surge, with production expected to exceed 4.2 million barrels per day this year. The increase is specifically linked to ramp-ups and start-ups of new floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels in the country&#39;s prolific pre-salt offshore fields. Petrobras and international partners continue to invest heavily in the deep-water Santos and Campos basins.</p>
<p>Argentina&#39;s shale revolution is accelerating, with investment in the Vaca Muerta formation expected to drive Latin American shale sector spending to nearly $11 billion in 2026, up from $9.4 billion in 2025. The country&#39;s vast unconventional resources are attracting international capital despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges.</p>
<p>Despite sanctions relief, Venezuela&#39;s oil output is projected to lag regional competitors through 2030. Years of underinvestment, mismanagement, and the departure of international partners have left the country&#39;s once-mighty oil industry struggling to ramp production, even as global demand and prices create incentives for increased output.</p>
<h3>15. India Assumes BRICS Presidency, Pushes Local Currency Trade Agenda</h3>
<p><em>Feb 1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>India took over the BRICS chairship for the fourth time with a focus on &quot;Building for Resilience, Innovation, Cooperation and Sustainability,&quot; promoting trade in local currencies while carefully distancing itself from proposals for a common BRICS currency that have raised concerns in Washington.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Modi announced he would give &quot;a new form&quot; to BRICS during India&#39;s tenure, emphasizing policy coordination, development finance, trade facilitation, and reform of global institutional governance. India&#39;s Rupee-Rouble trade with Russia is estimated to now account for over 90% of bilateral commerce, demonstrating the growing viability of de-dollarized transactions.</p>
<p>India&#39;s BRICS presidency gains particular significance amid global geopolitical turbulence, with New Delhi navigating complex relationships with both the United States—following the landmark trade deal announced on February 2—and its traditional strategic partner Russia. The balancing act requires careful diplomacy as Washington increases pressure on nations to reduce ties with Moscow.</p>
<p>The expanded BRICS+ grouping now includes Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Iran, creating a coalition that represents a significant share of global population, GDP, and energy production. India&#39;s leadership will be tested by managing diverse interests within the group while advancing its own strategic objectives in an increasingly multipolar world.</p>

<h2>Financial News (Top 15)</h2>
<h3>1. Alphabet Announces $185 Billion AI Spending Plan, Doubling 2025 Investment</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&#39;s parent company reported record fourth-quarter earnings while projecting capital expenditures of up to $185 billion for 2026—more than double its $91.4 billion spend in 2025—as CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the &quot;staggering&quot; scale of AI infrastructure investment is keeping him up at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alphabet beat Wall Street expectations, reporting earnings per share of $2.82 versus $2.63 estimated and revenue of $113.83 billion versus $111.43 billion expected. The company&#39;s annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time, with net income growing 15% to $132.2 billion. Google Cloud revenues surged 48% to $17.7 billion, driven by enterprise AI solutions.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter. Alphabet achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations and efficiency improvements. Pichai emphasized that AI is driving Search revenue growth as users engage with Google&#39;s AI mode features.</p>
<p>Despite the strong earnings, shares traded flat as investors weighed the massive spending commitment. The $185 billion guidance represents the largest capital expenditure plan ever announced by a technology company, raising questions about returns on AI infrastructure investment even as competitors race to match Alphabet&#39;s spending.</p>
<h3>2. Waymo Raises $16 Billion at $126 Billion Valuation, Plans Global Robotaxi Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alphabet&#39;s autonomous driving unit secured the largest investment ever in an autonomous vehicle company, with Dragoneer, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital leading a round that values Waymo at $126 billion—more than double its valuation from the October 2024 funding round.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The investor roster reads like a who&#39;s who of Silicon Valley: Andreessen Horowitz, Mubadala Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, T. Rowe Price, BDT &amp; MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek all participated. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.</p>
<p>Waymo plans to use the capital to expand to over 20 new cities in 2026, including its first international markets. Tokyo and London are confirmed as the company&#39;s initial overseas destinations, marking a significant milestone in the global deployment of autonomous vehicle technology. The expansion will require substantial investment in local regulatory approvals, mapping, and support infrastructure.</p>
<p>The massive valuation reflects investor confidence in Waymo&#39;s technological lead over competitors following General Motors&#39; decision to shut down its Cruise robotaxi unit. With Tesla still struggling to deliver on autonomous driving promises and Chinese competitors facing geopolitical headwinds, Waymo appears positioned to capture the lion&#39;s share of the emerging robotaxi market.</p>
<h3>3. Big Tech AI Spending Approaches $700 Billion as Hyperscalers Double Down</h3>
<p><em>Feb 6</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The four major cloud hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—announced combined 2026 capital expenditure plans approaching $700 billion, up from $350 billion in 2025, as the AI infrastructure arms race enters a new phase of intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta intends to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion in capex for 2026, joining Alphabet&#39;s $175-185 billion commitment. Microsoft and Amazon are also scaling investments dramatically, though exact figures vary. The spending surge reflects fierce competition to secure GPU capacity from Nvidia and build data center infrastructure capable of training and serving increasingly powerful AI models.</p>
<p>Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion this year through debt and equity financing to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity for its largest customers including AMD and Meta. The company is selling $25 billion in investment-grade bonds as part of the effort, highlighting how the AI boom is reshaping corporate finance across the technology sector.</p>
<p>The massive spending is taking a significant toll on cash reserves. Analysts note that while revenue growth remains strong, free cash flow is being consumed by infrastructure investment at an unprecedented rate. The question of whether this spending will generate adequate returns remains the central uncertainty for technology investors.</p>
<h3>4. Disney Experiences Division Crosses $10 Billion in Quarterly Revenue for First Time</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney Company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates, with its theme parks, resorts, and cruises division posting record revenue, though shares fell 7% after investors focused on slowing streaming growth and succession uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall revenue for the quarter was roughly $26 billion, up 5% year over year, with the experiences division generating $10 billion for the first time in history. Domestic theme parks recorded $6.91 billion in revenue while international parks reported $1.75 billion—each up 7% compared with the prior-year period. The cruise line expansion is contributing increasingly to the segment&#39;s performance.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter was $2.48 billion, or $1.34 per share, down from $2.64 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items including tax charges related to a deal with Fubo, Disney reported $1.63 in earnings per share, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.58.</p>
<p>Despite the strong operational performance, Disney shares came under pressure as investors digested news about CEO Bob Iger&#39;s succession timeline. The company reaffirmed its plan to repurchase $7 billion in stock for fiscal 2026, projected double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and expects $19 billion in cash provided by operations—but questions about leadership transition overshadowed the results.</p>
<h3>5. Tesla Reports First-Ever Annual Revenue Decline as Musk Pivots to AI and Robotics</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tesla reported 2025 full-year revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3% from $97.7 billion the previous year—the first annual decline in the electric vehicle maker&#39;s history—as CEO Elon Musk announced plans to end Model S and Model X production to make room for Optimus humanoid robots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations with adjusted EPS of 50 cents versus 45 cents estimated on revenue of $24.90 billion. However, net profit fell 61% to $840 million for the quarter, bringing full-year profit to $3.8 billion—down sharply from $7.1 billion in 2024. The margin compression reflects intensified price competition in the global EV market.</p>
<p>During the earnings call, Musk outlined a dramatic strategic transformation: Tesla will transition from an EV manufacturer to &quot;a full-blown real-world AI and robotics company.&quot; Model S and Model X production will end in Q2 2026, with Fremont factory space converted to manufacture Optimus humanoid robots. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said investors should expect approximately $20 billion in capital expenditure for 2026.</p>
<p>Musk claimed Tesla&#39;s robotaxi service has been &quot;rolled out in a few cities&quot; and will be &quot;very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US.&quot; The bold prediction drew skepticism from analysts who noted regulatory hurdles and the company&#39;s history of missed autonomous driving timelines. Wall Street&#39;s median year-end target implies roughly 10% upside from current levels.</p>
<h3>6. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Earnings as Weight Loss Drug Demand Soars</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pharmaceutical giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, crushing Wall Street expectations as blockbuster demand for weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro drives unprecedented revenue growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eli Lilly guided to 2026 revenue between $80 billion and $83 billion, dramatically exceeding analyst expectations of $77.62 billion. The company projects adjusted earnings between $33.50 and $35 per share, compared with the $33.23 consensus estimate. The guidance implies continued market share gains in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 drug category.</p>
<p>The earnings report contrasted sharply with Novo Nordisk&#39;s struggles earlier in the week, as Lilly appeared to be winning the competitive battle for weight loss drug market share. Production capacity investments are paying off, allowing Lilly to meet surging demand while Novo Nordisk faces supply constraints that have limited its growth.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s success reflects broader transformation in the pharmaceutical industry, as GLP-1 drugs emerge as potentially the largest drug class in history. Beyond obesity and diabetes, trials are exploring applications in cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other conditions—expanding the total addressable market beyond current analyst models.</p>
<h3>7. Pfizer Beats Estimates Despite Declining COVID Revenue, Reaffirms Modest Outlook</h3>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pfizer reported fourth-quarter results that topped analyst expectations even as demand for its COVID-19 products continued to decline, while reaffirming a 2026 outlook that projects essentially flat revenue compared to 2025 levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company expects 2026 adjusted profit between $2.80 and $3.00 per share, with revenue totaling $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. The guidance reflects the challenges of managing a post-pandemic portfolio as COVID vaccine and treatment revenues fade while the company works to develop new growth drivers.</p>
<p>Pfizer&#39;s results stand in stark contrast to the explosive growth reported by competitors like Eli Lilly, highlighting the divergent fortunes of pharmaceutical companies depending on their exposure to the GLP-1 weight loss drug category. Pfizer&#39;s attempts to enter the obesity market have faced setbacks, leaving the company without a clear path to matching rivals&#39; growth rates.</p>
<p>The company continues to invest in its oncology pipeline and other therapeutic areas, but investors remain skeptical about the timeline for meaningful revenue contributions. The modest guidance keeps Pfizer in a transition period as it seeks to replace pandemic-era profits with sustainable new product revenues.</p>
<h3>8. Mortgage Rates Fall to Three-Year Lows as Housing Activity Improves</h3>
<p><em>Feb 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.11%, the lowest level in more than three years, driving a surge in purchase applications and refinance activity as the spring selling season approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freddie Mac reported the 15-year fixed mortgage averaged 5.50%, while some lenders offered rates below 6% for well-qualified borrowers. The decline followed the Federal Reserve&#39;s decision to hold rates steady while signaling openness to future cuts. Analysts at Morgan Stanley project rates could hit 5.75% later this year if inflation continues to moderate.</p>
<p>Purchase and refinance applications have jumped year-over-year as lower rates create opportunities for both first-time buyers and existing homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments. Mortgage industry experts note that housing activity &quot;is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season&quot; after two years of elevated rate headwinds.</p>
<p>A recent analysis revealed that a surprising share of homeowners still carry mortgage rates above 5%, creating significant refinance demand as rates decline. The combination of pent-up buyer demand, falling rates, and limited inventory could produce competitive spring housing markets despite affordability challenges persisting in many metropolitan areas.</p>
<h3>9. CFPB Secures Emergency Funding Through March After Court Rejects Shutdown Attempt</h3>
<p><em>Feb 4</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau obtained $145 million in emergency funding from the Federal Reserve after a federal judge ruled in December that the Trump administration cannot close a congressionally-created agency without an act of Congress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acting Director Russell Vought had attempted to effectively shut down the CFPB in February 2025 by ordering staff to stop work on proposed rules, suspend finalized regulations, halt investigations, and cease supervision and examination activities. Most staff were placed on administrative leave as the administration sought to eliminate the consumer watchdog agency.</p>
<p>The December 30, 2025 court ruling rejected Vought&#39;s argument that he could unilaterally close the agency, ordering the CFPB to remain funded and operational. The $145 million transfer from the Federal Reserve Board will allow the agency to continue operations through at least March 2026, though its long-term future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy groups have warned that the ongoing attempts to neutralize the CFPB leave Americans more vulnerable to predatory lending, debt collection abuses, and financial fraud. Industry groups have welcomed the reduced regulatory oversight, arguing the agency exceeded its statutory authority under previous leadership.</p>
<h3>10. GM Projects $4 Billion in Tariff Costs for 2026 Despite Increased US Production</h3>
<p><em>Feb 3</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>General Motors announced plans to top Ford in US vehicle production while warning that tariff costs will reach between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2026, highlighting the significant financial burden of trade policy on American automakers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CEO Mary Barra outlined the production targets as part of the company&#39;s 2025 earnings report and 2026 guidance. The expansion of domestic manufacturing is partly designed to mitigate tariff exposure, but vehicles and components that cross borders multiple times during production still face significant duties under current trade policies.</p>
<p>The tariff burden comes as GM navigates the costly transition to electric vehicles while maintaining profitability in its traditional internal combustion engine business. The company must balance investment in next-generation technology against the headwinds of trade policy and increasingly competitive global EV markets.</p>
<p>Ford is scheduled to report earnings on February 10 and is expected to face similar tariff challenges. Both Detroit automakers have warned that tariff costs are being passed along to consumers through higher vehicle prices, contributing to affordability challenges that have dampened new car demand despite strong consumer interest.</p>
<h3>11. Semiconductor Industry Enters 2nm Manufacturing Race as AI Demand Strains Supply</h3>
<p><em>Feb 2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TSMC&#39;s 2nm process entered mass production with strong yields as the company battles Samsung and Intel for AI chip supremacy, with Apple reportedly exploring alternative foundries as capacity constraints force diversification of the global semiconductor supply chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TSMC sees its AI revenue growing at a mid- to high-50% compound annual growth rate through 2029, with Nvidia now surpassing Apple as the company&#39;s largest customer. Capacity is expected to ramp faster in 2026 driven by smartphones, high-performance computing, and AI applications, but demand continues to outpace supply.</p>
<p>Intel&#39;s 18A node has allowed the American chipmaker to regain technical parity with TSMC by some metrics, featuring power delivery innovation that TSMC does not expect to match until late 2026.

<h2>Fusion Energy</h2>
<h3>General Fusion Sets World Record with 600 Million Neutrons Per Second - <em>Jan 28, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Canadian company General Fusion achieves highest neutron output ever recorded for Magnetized Target Fusion, validated by IAEA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion, a Canadian company specializing in nuclear fusion technology, has set a world record by generating 600 million neutrons per second using Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF). This achievement was recognized and validated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and represents a crucial step toward demonstrating the viability of nuclear fusion as a sustainable and scalable energy source.</p>
<p>During compression, the plasma density rose to about 190 times the starting value and the magnetic field that holds it in place grew more than 13 times stronger, while the plasma stayed stable instead of tearing itself apart and delivered repeatable bursts of fusion neutrons. What sets General Fusion&#39;s method apart from traditional fusion techniques is its unique approach involving a liquid metal liner, where high-powered pistons compress the liquid metal mechanically, rapidly compressing plasma within a spherical tokamak.</p>
<p>Dr. Michel Laberge, founder and Chief Scientist of General Fusion, stated: &quot;This is the first-ever compression of a spherical tokamak using a collapsing metal liner. These results strengthen MTF as a viable path to commercial fusion energy.&quot; The results come from the long-running Plasma Compression Science experiment series, whose data have been reviewed by independent scientists and published in the journal Nuclear Fusion. The lessons from these experiments feed directly into Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), the larger demonstration device the company has built in Richmond, British Columbia.</p>
<h3>General Fusion Announces $1 Billion SPAC Merger, First Pure-Play Fusion IPO - <em>Feb 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General Fusion becomes first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion through SPAC deal, signaling growing investor confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Fusion is set to become the first publicly traded company dedicated solely to nuclear fusion, signaling growing investor confidence in the field. The company has agreed to merge with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. III in a roughly $1 billion SPAC deal announced January 21, 2026.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s piston-driven, liquid-lithium approach challenges magnet- and laser-based fusion designs while aiming to reduce material degradation. Instead of using powerful magnets or lasers, the model uses mechanical pistons to contain plasma within a liquid lithium shell, offering a potentially more practical path to commercial fusion power.</p>
<p>This IPO represents a watershed moment for the fusion industry, which has collectively raised over $7.1 billion to date. Commonwealth Fusion Systems leads funding at nearly $3 billion following its $863 million Series B2 in August 2025, but General Fusion&#39;s public offering opens a new avenue for retail and institutional investors to participate in the fusion energy revolution.</p>
<h3>China&#39;s EAST Tokamak Achieves &quot;Density-Free Regime&quot; Breakthrough - <em>Jan 1, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese scientists break through the long-theorized plasma density limit, removing a major obstacle toward fusion ignition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists working with China&#39;s fully superconducting Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) have successfully reached a long-theorized &quot;density-free regime&quot; in fusion plasma experiments. In this groundbreaking state, the plasma remains stable even when its density rises far beyond traditional limits that have constrained tokamak operations for decades.</p>
<p>The experiment, published in Science Advances, confirmed that plasma can remain stable even at extreme densities if its interaction with the reactor walls is carefully controlled. This finding effectively removes the Greenwald density limit, a major obstacle that has slowed progress toward practical fusion energy generation for years. Using a newly developed high-density operating approach on EAST, the team showed that plasma density can be pushed well beyond long-accepted empirical limits without triggering violent instabilities.</p>
<p>The breakthrough demonstrates that with proper wall conditioning and plasma control techniques, tokamaks can operate at much higher performance levels than previously thought possible, bringing commercial fusion power closer to reality. This research could fundamentally change how future fusion reactors are designed and operated.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan Strategic Fusion Partnership Launched - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering establish collaboration to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate commercialization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy and Kyoto Fusioneering launched a strategic partnership to build critical fusion infrastructure and accelerate deployment of commercial fusion power. The agreement could serve as a model for joint public-private investment and international collaboration to develop fusion technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Collaboration between U.S. and U.K. research teams has already yielded crucial findings. Both machines confirmed that energy confinement scales more favorably to the expected operating regime in fusion pilot plants in spherical tokamaks than in conventional designs—a finding that could determine the shape of future commercial fusion plants.</p>
<p>This international cooperation reflects growing recognition that fusion energy development benefits from shared resources and expertise across borders. With multiple countries racing toward commercial fusion, partnerships like this one help distribute both the costs and the knowledge gained from cutting-edge experiments.</p>
<h3>Commonwealth Fusion Systems Partners with NVIDIA and Siemens for AI-Powered Development - <em>Jan 6, 8:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CFS announces partnership leveraging AI-powered digital twins to compress years of fusion experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems has announced a major partnership with NVIDIA and Siemens to accelerate the development of commercial fusion energy using artificial intelligence. The collaboration will create AI-powered digital twins of fusion systems to dramatically speed up the development process.</p>
<p>&quot;CFS will be able to compress years of manual experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization using the digital infrastructure developed by NVIDIA and Siemens,&quot; said Bob Mumgaard, Co-Founder and CEO of CFS. Leveraging data from Siemens and an AI platform from Nvidia, CFS is creating what it calls a &quot;digital twin&quot; of its demonstration machine to speed progress toward commercial fusion.</p>
<p>CFS aims to hit a key technical milestone in 2027—generating net energy at its SPARC demonstration reactor in Massachusetts—before producing commercial-scale fusion energy in the early 2030s. The company has raised nearly $3 billion to date, making it the best-funded private fusion venture in the world.</p>

<h2>Human Genetics &amp; Gene Science</h2>
<h3>First Patient Dosed with CRISPR Epigenetic Silencer for Hepatitis B - <em>Jan 30, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio begins Phase 1/2 trial of CRMA-1001, a CRISPR-derived therapy that silences hepatitis B virus without cutting the genome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nChroma Bio has dosed the first patient with CRMA-1001, an innovative CRISPR-Cas–derived epigenetic silencer designed to treat chronic hepatitis B infection. Unlike traditional gene editing, this therapy methylates viral DNA without making cuts to the genome, representing a fundamentally new approach to treating viral diseases.</p>
<p>The open-label Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and antiviral durability of the treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Regulatory approvals have enabled the study to expand to the UK and New Zealand, broadening the international scope of this promising research. CRMA-1001 specifically targets HBV cccDNA and integrated viral DNA, aiming to achieve a functional cure by silencing the virus&#39;s ability to replicate.</p>
<p>This represents a new paradigm in treating viral infections, using precision epigenetic tools to silence viral genes while leaving the host genome intact. With approximately 296 million people living with chronic hepatitis B worldwide, a functional cure could transform global public health outcomes for this persistent viral infection.</p>
<h3>CRISPR Breakthrough: Turning Genes On Without Cutting DNA - <em>Jan 4, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists develop safer gene therapy approach using epigenetic editing to reactivate silenced genes without making permanent cuts to DNA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists at UNSW Sydney have developed a revolutionary new form of CRISPR technology that can turn genes back on without cutting DNA. Instead of making permanent edits to the genetic code, this approach removes chemical tags (methyl groups) that act like molecular anchors, silencing genes.</p>
<p>The work confirms that these epigenetic tags actively silence genes, settling a long-running scientific debate in the field. Rather than cutting DNA, the new technique uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups, releasing the genetic brakes that keep certain genes switched off. One key target is the fetal globin gene, which helps deliver oxygen before birth.</p>
<p>Reactivating the fetal globin gene after birth could help bypass defects in the adult globin gene that cause Sickle Cell disease. Scientists say this breakthrough opens the door to powerful new therapies with fewer unintended side effects, potentially transforming the gene therapy landscape and making treatments accessible to more patients who currently have limited options.</p>
<h3>Personalized CRISPR Therapy Team Plans Landmark Clinical Trial - <em>Jan 28, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers behind KJ Muldoon&#39;s historic treatment plan new trial type that could treat multiple rare diseases with as few as 5-10 patients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team behind the world&#39;s first personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy is planning an entirely new type of clinical trial to make this technology more accessible to patients with rare diseases. Researchers at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine created a bespoke in vivo CRISPR therapy for infant KJ Muldoon in just six months.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to launch a clinical trial in 2026 that can enroll patients with any of 7 different urea cycle disorders, caused by any variant in any of 7 genes that can be corrected by the same type of gene editor used in KJ&#39;s therapy. Successful treatment of a small number of participants—as few as 5-10—might be sufficient for FDA approval.</p>
<p>This landmark case paves the way for a future with on-demand gene-editing therapies for individuals with rare, until-now untreatable genetic diseases. The approach could fundamentally change how rare disease treatments are developed and approved, making personalized medicine a reality for thousands of patients with ultra-rare conditions.</p>
<h3>CRISPR CAR-T Therapy Shows 70% Complete Response in Cancer Trials - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy zugo-cel achieves remarkable results in B-cell lymphoma and autoimmune disease trials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics&#39; allogeneic CAR T therapy, zugo-cel (CTX112), is showing remarkable early promise in clinical trials for both autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), a 100M-cell dose induced rapid B-cell depletion and clinical improvement.</p>
<p>Importantly, the therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) observed. In relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma patients, a higher 600M-cell dose achieved an impressive complete response rate of 70%.</p>
<p>These results position zugo-cel as a potential breakthrough in both oncology and autoimmune disease treatment, with the allogeneic (off-the-shelf) approach potentially making CAR-T therapy accessible to far more patients than current autologous approaches that require manufacturing cells from each individual patient.</p>
<h3>iECURE&#39;s Gene Editing Treatment Receives Dual Fast-Track Designations - <em>Jan 21, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ECUR-506 secures both FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation and UK Innovation Passport for treating neonatal conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>iECURE&#39;s ECUR-506 gene editing treatment has received significant regulatory recognition, securing both the US FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation and a UK Innovation Passport. These designations will accelerate the development pathway for this promising therapy targeting severe neonatal conditions.</p>
<p>The treatment targets severe neonatal conditions where early intervention is critical. The dual regulatory fast-tracking demonstrates international recognition of the therapy&#39;s potential to address unmet medical needs in some of the most vulnerable patient populations.</p>
<p>RMAT designation provides intensive FDA guidance, eligibility for priority review, and potential accelerated approval, while the UK Innovation Passport offers similar benefits in the British regulatory system, positioning ECUR-506 for rapid global development. This dual recognition underscores growing momentum for gene editing therapies treating conditions that were previously considered untreatable.</p>

<h1>Weekly Finance Briefing</h1>
<p><strong>Week of January 27 - February 2, 2026</strong></p>
<p><em>Research Generated: February 3, 2026, 11:45 AM PST</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Inflation &amp; Finance Metrics</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady in Split Decision Amid Political Pressure - <em>Jan 28, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The FOMC voted 10-2 to keep interest rates at 3.50%-3.75%, ending a string of three consecutive quarter-point cuts as Chair Powell described the economy as on &quot;firm footing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, January 28, marking the central bank&#39;s first pause since July 2025. The decision came after three consecutive quarter-point reductions delivered between September and December 2025, which Powell characterized as having moved policy toward a &quot;neutral&quot; range. Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented from the decision, favoring continued cuts.</p>
<p>In his post-meeting press conference, Chair Jerome Powell stated that &quot;if you look at the incoming data since the last meeting, there is clear improvement in the outlook for growth. Inflation performed about as expected, and some of the labor market data came in suggesting evidence of stabilization.&quot; Powell noted there was &quot;broad support on the Committee for holding today,&quot; including among non-voting members, though some wanted to continue cutting.</p>
<p>Futures markets now expect at most two quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2026, with the first anticipated in June and a second in the fall, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The decision comes as President Trump announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would replace Powell when his term ends in May.</p>
<h3>Government Shutdown Delays Key January Jobs Report - <em>Feb 2, 10:30 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the January employment report will not be released as scheduled on February 6 after lawmakers failed to reach funding agreement following controversial DHS enforcement actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government partially shut down on January 31 after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding, an impasse sparked by outcry over the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota—specifically the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6.</p>
<p>In addition to the January jobs report, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) release for December 2025 and the Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for December 2025 will also be rescheduled. The BLS stated that &quot;due to the partial federal government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will suspend data collection, processing, and dissemination.&quot;</p>
<p>Signs from Capitol Hill suggest this shutdown will be brief—unlike the 43-day shutdown that concluded November 12. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he anticipates passing funding legislation early this week. Unlike in last year&#39;s shutdown, which resulted in major inflation and unemployment data going uncollected for October, the relevant data has already been collected. Economists had expected the January jobs report to show employers added 80,000 jobs last month, up from 50,000 in December.</p>
<h3>Tariff Costs Set to Hit Consumers Harder as Businesses Pass Along Price Increases - <em>Jan 30, 9:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After absorbing roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, businesses are now passing those costs to consumers, with the figure expected to flip to just 20% business absorption later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump&#39;s tariffs are increasingly impacting consumer prices as businesses exhaust their pretariff inventory and begin passing costs to shoppers. According to JPMorgan analysis, businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that ratio could shrink to just 20% later this year as companies implement further price hikes. Goldman Sachs economists estimated that tariffs caused inflation to increase by half a percentage point in 2025.</p>
<p>According to NBER research, since President Trump announced broad tariff measures starting in the spring, the import taxes increased the inflation rate by 0.7 percentage points between March and August. The annual inflation rate for August—which was 2.9%—would have been 2.2% without tariffs. Before Trump took office, the U.S. average effective tariff rate was 2.4%, according to estimates from the Yale Budget Lab. At the end of 2025, it was 16.8%.</p>
<p>Consumer goods with the steepest price increases since Trump took office tend to be those with lower profit margins. Prices of heavily imported items—including tomatoes and coffee—have changed more significantly than most other goods. The United States collected $187 billion more in tariff revenue in 2025 than it did in 2024, a nearly 200% increase. According to Budget Lab research, tariffs represent an income loss of $1,700 for the average U.S. household.</p>
<h3>Warren Report: Households Paid $2,120 More Due to Inflation in 2025 - <em>Jan 30, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Warren&#39;s team found year-on-year inflation equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, with lower-income families facing costs exceeding 5% of their income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren released a report through the Senate Banking Committee detailing how households paid an estimated $2,120 more in 2025 because of inflation—including an estimated $123 more on electricity bills and an estimated $150 more for groceries. The year-on-year inflation increase equates to an added cost of $2,120 per household, assuming they purchased the same goods and services in 2025 that they bought in 2024.</p>
<p>Higher prices have fallen hardest on those least able to afford them. In 2025, the bottom 20% of households faced roughly $950 in additional inflation-related costs—more than 5% of their estimated income. In contrast, although the top 20% paid more in absolute dollars, those costs amounted to just 2% of their estimated income. The report documents sharp price increases for everyday grocery staples, including coffee and beef prices, which are up a respective 29% and 21% since January 2025.</p>
<p>The report comes as the annual inflation rate in the United States was 2.7% for the 12 months ending December, according to U.S. Labor Department data released on January 13, 2026. While inflation is off its 40-year highs from 2022, the rate is still running closer to 3% than the Fed&#39;s 2% goal, causing concern among some FOMC officials who either want rate cuts paused or eliminated until there&#39;s more evidence that price increases are easing.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Case Threatens Fed Independence as Powell Calls It &quot;Most Important&quot; in 113 Years - <em>Jan 21, 10:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments in the Lisa Cook case, while separately facing DOJ subpoenas over building renovations that he characterizes as &quot;pretexts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attended Supreme Court oral arguments on January 21 in a landmark case addressing whether President Donald Trump can fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell called the case &quot;perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed&#39;s 113-year history,&quot; adding that &quot;as I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn&#39;t attend.&quot; The case tests the legal boundaries of presidential power and the independence of the central bank.</p>
<p>Trump cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements in applying for home mortgages. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term. All three former living Fed chairs—Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen—signed on to a legal brief arguing against Cook&#39;s removal, along with a group of former Treasury secretaries and chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>The Trump administration also hit the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on January 9, initiating a criminal investigation into Powell for his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June regarding cost overruns at Federal Reserve building renovations. Powell stated: &quot;This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of federal reserve buildings. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.&quot;</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Developments</h2>
<h3>Bitcoin Crashes Below $75,000 in Weekend Bloodbath, Marking Fourth Consecutive Monthly Decline - <em>Feb 2, 9:15 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since April 2025, wiping roughly $800 billion in market value since its October peak and knocking it out of the global top 10 assets as leveraged long positions were liquidated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin plunged below $75,000 on Sunday, February 2, extending a drawdown that has wiped more than 30% off the value of the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency since its October 2025 peak of approximately $126,000. The move marked Bitcoin&#39;s lowest level since April 2025, when markets were rattled by U.S. tariff announcements. The drop capped Bitcoin&#39;s fourth consecutive monthly decline and its longest losing streak in seven years.</p>
<p>A confluence of factors drove the crash: President Trump&#39;s nomination of Kevin Warsh—a known monetary hawk—to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair landed as a shock to markets, immediately resetting expectations for rate cuts. The U.S. dollar surged, rate-cut odds for the first half of 2026 collapsed, and risk assets were repriced lower. Disappointing earnings from Magnificent Seven tech companies cracked the AI narrative, while a violent precious metals unwind added to risk-off sentiment.</p>
<p>Data from Glassnode confirms that Bitcoin fell below its True Market Mean—currently at $80,500—for the first time in 30 months. Historically, a breach of this level marks a switch from a bullish cycle to a medium-term bearish trend. Compass Point analysts say the crypto bear market is in its &quot;final innings,&quot; with bitcoin likely to bottom between $60,000 and $68,000 absent a broader U.S. equity bear market. They warn that the $70,000 to $80,000 range is an &quot;air pocket&quot; with little structural support.</p>
<h3>January 2026 Bitcoin ETF Outflows Hit $1.6 Billion as Institutional Appetite Evaporates - <em>Jan 31, 4:30 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted their worst month since launch with $1.61 billion in net outflows, while BlackRock&#39;s IBIT alone shed over $500 million in a single day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>January 2026 proved to be a brutal reset month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posting -$1.61 billion in net outflows for the month. Total monthly traded value reached $86.99 billion, with $106.96 billion in total net assets at month end. The ETF bid that underpinned Bitcoin through much of 2025 has effectively evaporated.</p>
<p>U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs suffered heavy redemptions on January 29, with nearly $1 billion yanked in a single session. Investors withdrew $817.9 million from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs on January 29, the largest daily outflow since November 20. BlackRock&#39;s IBIT bore the brunt of redemptions, shedding $317.8 million, while Fidelity&#39;s FBTC lost $168 million and Grayscale&#39;s GBTC saw $119.4 million exit.</p>
<p>The 11 spot ETFs cumulatively registered a net outflow of $1.09 billion in December after a much steeper $3.48 billion in November. That amounts to a combined two-month redemption worth $4.57 billion—the largest since their debut in January 2024. On the Ethereum side, January 30 showed net ETF flow of -$252.87 million, with $1.80 billion traded value and $15.86 billion total net assets.</p>
<h3>$2.5 Billion Liquidation Cascade Amplifies Crypto Downturn - <em>Jan 31, 11:00 AM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Forced deleveraging triggered over $2.5 billion in liquidations in a single 24-hour period, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion as overleveraged traders were forced to close positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of forced selling was staggering, with more than $2 billion of bitcoin long and short positions liquidated since Thursday, January 30. This wasn&#39;t a gradual correction—it was a violent deleveraging wave that forced prices down sharply. Market structure evidence supports a liquidity and positioning driven move into month end.</p>
<p>In a single 24-hour period, $2.53 billion in futures liquidations occurred, with long positions bearing the brunt at $2.41 billion. Ethereum was the hardest hit, accounting for nearly half of the total carnage with $1.14 billion in liquidations. Forced deleveraging acted as a direct transmission mechanism, with estimated 24-hour liquidations exceeding $1.7 billion around January 30, followed by an estimated $2.5 billion on January 31.</p>
<p>Bitcoin fell about 12% in the last seven days, wiping off more than $200 billion in market value and triggering over $2 billion in forced liquidations, creating a cascading effect that amplified the downturn. According to analysts, the outflows coincided with a broader risk-off sentiment driven by hawkish Fed expectations and geopolitical tensions, with ETF flows reacting to price weakness rather than leading it.</p>
<h3>Senate Agriculture Committee Advances Landmark Crypto Regulation Bill - <em>Jan 29, 3:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In a historic first, a crypto market structure bill advanced beyond a Senate committee as the Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act passed on a 12-11 party-line vote, establishing CFTC regulatory authority over digital commodities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines on January 29 to advance its version of a cryptocurrency market structure bill, marking the first time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act advanced on a 12-11 vote with all Republicans voting &quot;yes&quot; and all Democrats voting &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislation would establish a clear legal definition of digital commodities and create a spot market digital commodity intermediary regulatory regime with the CFTC. It would also create consumer protections, including conflict of interest safeguards and customer disclosure requirements. The proposed bill grants regulatory authority to both the CFTC and the SEC and clarifies the jurisdictional scope between the two agencies—the CFTC would be granted explicit authority over spot market digital asset commodities, while the SEC would maintain authority over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract.</p>
<p>The crypto industry now has two permanent, crypto-friendly chairmen at the SEC and CFTC, with no Democratic pushback. Paul Atkins leads the SEC, while Trump nominee Mike Selig won confirmation late last month and was sworn in as CFTC chairman on December 22. The Senate Banking Committee would also need to approve its version of a crypto market structure bill before the two measures could combine and advance to the full Senate.</p>
<h3>Geopolitical Tensions and Iran Explosion Rattle Crypto Markets - <em>Feb 1, 2:00 PM</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A sharp escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, including an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port, triggered a wave of selling across crypto, gold, silver, and U.S. stock futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto markets extended their decline as geopolitical tensions escalated, with the selloff gathering pace following reports of an explosion at Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas port—a critical shipping hub on the Strait of Hormuz that handles about a fifth of the world&#39;s seaborne oil. Bitcoin fell sharply, sliding below the $80,000 mark to levels last seen in April 2025, while Ethereum hovered near $2,200 as a wave of liquidations hit leveraged positions during low-liquidity weekend trading.</p>
<p>For the first time, the United States has sanctioned crypto exchanges linked to Iran. This decision, announced at the end of January 2026, targets two British platforms accused of facilitating transactions for Iranian entities under embargo—specifically Zedex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd. for their alleged role in financing Iranian entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>Iran&#39;s crypto ecosystem reached over $7.78 billion in 2025, having grown at a notably faster pace compared to the year prior. Iran&#39;s crypto activity shows significant spikes corresponding to major domestic and geopolitical events. During Iran&#39;s recent protests and internet blackout from December 28, 2025 to January 8, 2026, there were substantial increases in both daily dollar amounts transacted and withdrawals from Iranian exchanges to personal Bitcoin wallets—suggesting Iranians are taking possession of Bitcoin at a markedly higher rate as a rational response to the collapse of the Iranian rial.</p>
