## Geopolitical News (Top 15)

### 1. New START Nuclear Treaty Expires, Ending 50 Years of Arms Control *(Feb 3, 8:00 AM)*

> The last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time in over 50 years that no bilateral arms control agreements are in force between the world's two largest nuclear powers.

The New START Treaty, signed in 2010, had capped deployed strategic nuclear forces at 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery systems. Russia suspended its participation in 2023 but continued to observe numerical limits. President Putin offered in September 2025 to extend the limits for one more year, but the U.S. never formally responded. President Trump reportedly said of the agreement, "If it expires, it expires."

The treaty's expiration raises profound concerns about an unconstrained nuclear build-up. The situation is more complex than the Cold War arms race given China's nuclear expansion—the Pentagon estimates China's stockpile has nearly tripled since 2020 to the low 600s and projects 1,000 warheads by 2030. Trump has insisted any future negotiations must include China, which has never been party to strategic arms limits.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock to just 89 seconds to midnight at the start of 2026, the closest ever. Experts warn the prospects for a replacement agreement are extremely low, as meaningful arms control requires trust and communication—neither of which currently exists between Washington and Moscow.

### 2. Ukraine-Russia Peace Talks Resume in Abu Dhabi *(Feb 1, 10:00 AM)*

> Trilateral negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States resumed in Abu Dhabi on February 4-5, following a landmark first round last month that marked the first direct talks since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff held constructive preliminary talks with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev in Florida over the weekend, joined by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Jared Kushner, and White House senior adviser Josh Gruenbaum. Moscow announced the two sides have "narrowed their differences on some issues" though significant disagreements remain.

The fundamental territorial divide remains unresolved. Russia, which occupies approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, is pushing for full control of the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and refuses to sign any deal that fails to deter future Russian aggression. A brief energy infrastructure truce expired Sunday, and Russian drone strikes continued, including one that hit a maternity hospital in southern Ukraine.

Ukraine claims Russia has suffered more than 1.24 million troop casualties, though such figures are difficult to verify. Combined military casualties on both sides may be approaching two million, making this one of Europe's deadliest conflicts in decades. Some 43% of Ukrainians don't believe the war will end in 2026, up 14 points from December.

### 3. US-Iran Nuclear Talks Scheduled for Istanbul *(Feb 2, 2:00 PM)*

> High-stakes nuclear negotiations between Washington and Tehran are scheduled for Friday, February 6, in Istanbul—the first direct diplomatic engagement since the 12-day war last June that saw Israel attack Iran.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will meet in what could be a pivotal moment for Middle East stability. Turkey is leading the mediation effort, backed by Qatar and Egypt, with foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan, and Oman also invited. President Trump warned of "bad things" if talks fail, while military buildup continues in the region.

The fundamental divide remains: the Trump administration demands any deal cover Iran's nuclear program, missile program, and regional proxies, while Iran insists only nuclear matters are negotiable. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered his team to pursue "fair and equitable negotiations" in an environment "free from threats and unreasonable expectations." Foreign Minister Araghchi stated: "We're ready for diplomacy, but they must understand that diplomacy is not compatible with threats, intimidation or pressure."

The stakes are enormous. After a previous 60-day deadline passed without agreement, Israel attacked Iran, igniting a full-scale regional war. Supreme Leader Khamenei has warned any U.S. attack would trigger another "regional war."

### 4. EU Designates Iran's Revolutionary Guard as Terrorist Organization *(Jan 29, 11:00 AM)*

> EU foreign ministers unanimously designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, a landmark decision following the regime's brutal crackdown on protesters that has killed thousands.

France was the last holdout among the 27-member bloc, shifting its position on January 28 after security forces killed at least 6,000 Iranians in recent weeks—with some officials fearing more than 30,000 dead. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called it a "decisive step." The United States, Canada, and Australia had already designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization.

Tehran responded furiously, calling the decision "illegal, political and contrary to international law." In retaliation, Iran declared all EU militaries "terrorist groups" and summoned EU ambassadors to protest. The Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the move as a violation of the country's internal affairs.

Ukraine also designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization, aligning with the EU. The designation carries significant implications for sanctions, asset freezes, and travel bans targeting IRGC members and affiliated entities across Europe.

### 5. Syria Integrates Kurdish Forces Under US-Brokered Deal *(Feb 2, 9:00 AM)*

> Syrian government forces began deploying to Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast, implementing a U.S.-backed agreement to integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) into state institutions.

The deal ends weeks of fighting between Damascus and the SDF following the overthrow of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. About 100 Syrian internal security personnel drove into Kobani, Hasakah, and Qamishli on Monday. Under the agreement, military forces won't enter Kurdish-majority areas, but security forces will take control of state institutions, airports, and border crossings.

The agreement foresees SDF integration into the Syrian military, including a new division with three SDF brigades. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mustafa said the deal includes transfer of oil fields, Qamishli airport, and border crossings to the government within 10 days. Full implementation is expected within a month.

A January 17 decree by Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa recognized citizenship rights for Syria's Kurds—an issue unresolved since the 1960s. President Trump said he was "very happy" with developments after speaking with al-Sharaa. However, experts warn the Kurdish question is "postponed, not ended," as a durable political settlement remains elusive.

### 6. Gaza's Rafah Crossing Reopens After Two Years *(Feb 2, 7:00 AM)*

> The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt partially reopened on Monday for the first time in over two years, allowing limited medical evacuations under the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan.

The crossing had been closed since shortly after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack. Israel will allow only 50 Palestinians to enter and exit daily—a fraction of what humanitarian groups say is needed. On the first day, only five patients were able to leave, with critics noting there was "no information, no promises" from Israel about expanding access.

The reopening followed the recovery of the last hostage's remains—police officer Ran Gvili—on January 26, after the IDF exhumed hundreds of bodies and tested around 250 before identification. Since the ceasefire began in October 2025, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel.

Significant tensions persist. According to Gaza's Government Media Office, Israel violated the ceasefire at least 1,450 times through February 1, including airstrikes that killed over 30 people on Saturday alone. The ceasefire's second phase confronts thornier issues including a new governance structure and disarming Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades.

### 7. Belarusian Balloon Incursions Escalate Hybrid Warfare Against NATO *(Jan 30, 4:00 PM)*

> Dozens of balloons carrying contraband cigarettes from Belarus forced airports to close in Lithuania and Poland, in what NATO officials increasingly describe as a deliberate hybrid warfare campaign by Russia and its ally.

On Tuesday night, Lithuanian authorities detected 42 balloon flights, forcing Vilnius airport to halt operations multiple times. The next night, Poland's eastern airspace was violated. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski accused Belarus of "waging a hybrid war against our country." Lithuania's Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene called the incidents "hybrid attacks" and said her country could invoke Article 4 of the NATO treaty.

Lithuania announced it will start shooting down unidentified balloons entering its airspace. Poland deployed anti-drone radar, expanded electronic sensors along its 418-km Belarusian border, and fast-tracked legislation allowing the military to down unidentified aerial objects within a 5-km border buffer. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the alliance "stands in full solidarity with its ally."

The Belarusian tobacco industry is controlled by Lukashenko's inner circle. Officials warn: "Who can guarantee that one day instead of cigarettes, there is no bomb, explosive or anything else?" Since October, Vilnius airport has been closed for more than 60 hours due to the balloon threat, affecting over 350 flights and 51,000 passengers. Lukashenko dismissed the concerns as a "mad scam."

### 8. DOJ Releases 3.5 Million Pages of Epstein Files *(Jan 30, 12:00 PM)*

> The Department of Justice released over 3.5 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein files including 2,000+ videos and 180,000 images, completing the legally mandated disclosure under the Epstein Files Transparency Act signed by President Trump in November.

The files cover FBI and DOJ documents, court records, and materials from cases against Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Some documents mention prominent figures including President Trump, former President Clinton, and Elon Musk, though none have been tied to wrongdoing. Howard Lutnick, now Commerce Secretary, was shown to have corresponded with Epstein through intermediaries in 2011-2012.

The release sparked immediate controversy. Attorneys for 200+ alleged victims asked federal judges to order an immediate takedown, calling it "the single most egregious violation of victim privacy in one day in United States history." Victims' attorneys said the files exposed 43 survivors' unredacted names, including two dozen minors, along with home addresses.

Slovakia's national security adviser Miroslav Lajčák, a former President of the UN General Assembly, resigned on January 31 after his name appeared in the documents. Deputy AG Todd Blanche said 500+ lawyers worked through weekends and holidays to review more than 6 million pages to decide what to release.

### 9. Deadly Mine Collapse Kills 227 in Congo's Rebel-Controlled Coltan Mines *(Jan 31, 6:00 AM)*

> A landslide collapsed several tunnels at the Rubaya coltan mines in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killing at least 227 people including miners, children, and market women in one of the deadliest mining disasters in the country's history.

Rubaya produces about 15% of the world's coltan, which is processed into tantalum—a heat-resistant metal essential for mobile phones, computers, aerospace components, and gas turbines. The mine has been controlled by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group since May 2024, generating at least $800,000 monthly in taxes on coltan trade.

Miners dig by hand for a few dollars per day through poorly constructed tunnels with no safe evacuation routes. A former miner told the AP there have been repeated landslides because tunnels aren't maintained. A survivor explained: "Seeing our peers die is very painful. But despite the pain, we are forced to return to the mines to survive. It has almost become normal."

The Congolese government accused M23 rebels of illegally and unsafely exploiting natural resources. Rebel authorities temporarily halted artisanal mining near Rubaya, about 50km from Goma. This disaster marks a sharp increase from a June 2025 collapse at the same site that killed 12.

### 10. Sudan Airport Reopens as Government Returns to Khartoum *(Feb 1, 8:00 AM)*

> Sudan Airways operated the first scheduled commercial flight to Khartoum International Airport since the civil war began, as Prime Minister Kamil Idris announced the government's return to the capital after nearly three years operating from Port Sudan.

The Airbus A320 carried 160 passengers from Port Sudan, with the airport now able to handle up to four daily flights. The Sudanese military recaptured Khartoum from the Rapid Support Forces in March 2025, and the Central Bank announced resumption of operations in the capital for the first time since fighting began in April 2023.

The military has made significant gains, breaking a two-year RSF siege of Dilling town in South Kordofan and recapturing several other strategic positions. However, the RSF still controls most of Darfur and parts of Kordofan. RSF forces continue attacks, including a drone strike that killed dozens in South Kordofan last week.

The conflict has created the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis, with over 100,000 killed and 14 million displaced. A UN-monitored ceasefire proposal calling for RSF withdrawal and reintegration of fighters was rejected by the paramilitary group. Experts assess continued conflict is the most likely scenario throughout 2026.

### 11. US Government Shutdown Enters Fifth Day, Jobs Report Delayed *(Jan 31, 3:00 PM)*

> A partial government shutdown affecting eight federal departments stretched into its fifth day as House Republicans worked to clear procedural hurdles, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics unable to release the January jobs report.

The shutdown was sparked by an impasse over immigration enforcement funding following fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis. Democrats demanded DHS funding be stripped from the package after Border Patrol agents killed two U.S. citizens, Alex Pretti and Renée Good, in incidents where eyewitness video contradicted official accounts.

Over 10,000 FAA workers were furloughed and 14,000 air traffic controllers worked without pay. The Labor Department saw furloughs of nearly three-quarters of staff, leaving the BLS unable to compile employment data. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence the shutdown would end by Tuesday after key Republican holdouts dropped opposition following a White House meeting.

The partial shutdown differs from previous full government closures—Congress had already passed half the year's funding bills, ensuring nutrition assistance and other critical programs continued. However, the delayed jobs report adds uncertainty to Fed policy assessments at a critical time for monetary decisions.

### 12. Kendrick Lamar Dominates Grammys with Five Wins *(Feb 1, 11:00 PM)*

> Kendrick Lamar won five Grammy Awards including Record of the Year for "Luther" featuring SZA, surpassing Jay-Z to become the most-awarded hip-hop artist in Grammy history, while Bad Bunny's "Debí Tirar Más Fotos" became the first Spanish-language Album of the Year.

Lamar, who had the most nominations with nine, swept the rap categories: Best Rap Album for "GNX," Best Rap Song for "tv off," Best Melodic Rap Performance for "luther," and Best Rap Performance for "Chains & Whips." His fourth five-win Grammy night was his second consecutive Record of the Year, and "GNX" was his fifth straight studio album nominated for Album of the Year—an unprecedented feat.

Bad Bunny's historic Album of the Year win made him just the third Latino artist to receive the honor and the first for a Spanish-language album. Other notable winners included Billie Eilish for Song of the Year ("Wildflower"), Olivia Dean for Best New Artist, and Lady Gaga for Best Pop Vocal Album ("Mayhem").

The ceremony also featured political moments, with artists criticizing ICE and immigration enforcement policies. The event took place at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with host Trevor Noah returning for the fourth time.

### 13. Carlos Alcaraz Completes Career Grand Slam at Australian Open *(Feb 1, 5:30 AM)*

> Spain's Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 to win his first Australian Open title, becoming the youngest man in tennis history to complete the career Grand Slam at 22 years, 8 months, and 27 days.

Alcaraz broke Rafael Nadal's 16-year record of youngest career Slam completion (24 years, 101 days). After a flat opening set where Djokovic came out firing, the Spaniard locked in from the baseline to take control. He broke decisively in the 12th game of the fourth set to seal a three-hour, two-minute victory.

The win ended Djokovic's unbeaten 10-0 record in Australian Open finals. At 38 years and 255 days, Djokovic became the oldest man in tournament history to reach the final, but his wait for an all-time record 25th Grand Slam title continues. Alcaraz's seventh major puts him alongside John McEnroe and Mats Wilander on the all-time list.

The semifinal between Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev was the longest Australian Open semifinal at 5 hours 27 minutes. Meanwhile, Djokovic's semifinal victory over two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner was an instant classic that the Serbian called "one of my best performances in the last decade."

### 14. Iran Protests Continue Amid Brutal Crackdown *(Jan 29, 9:00 AM)*

> Iranian protesters continue gathering in Tehran and other cities despite a deadly crackdown by security forces that human rights organizations say has killed at least 6,000 people, with some European officials fearing the toll exceeds 30,000.

The protests erupted in response to government policies and have been met with extreme brutality, particularly by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Evidence gathered by human rights organizations documents systematic use of lethal force against demonstrators. Three women shared stories of resistance, fear, and hope for freedom as the movement persists despite the violent suppression.

The crackdown prompted the EU's historic decision to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization on January 29, joining the U.S., Canada, and Australia. The designation was a direct response to the regime's violence against its own citizens and carries significant implications for sanctions and asset freezes targeting IRGC members.

The protests represent one of the most significant challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 2022 uprising following the death of Mahsa Amini. International pressure is mounting as evidence of atrocities accumulates, though the regime shows no signs of moderating its response.

### 15. Trump Threatens Canada with 100% Tariffs Over China Trade Deal *(Jan 31, 2:00 PM)*

> President Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada after Ottawa negotiated a deal with China to lower tariffs on electric vehicles in exchange for reduced taxes on Canadian farm products, escalating tensions with America's northern ally.

The latest tariff threat came days after Trump announced he would hit Canada's aircraft imports with 50% duties and decertify new jets from Bombardier, claiming Canada uses certification hurdles to effectively ban U.S. Gulfstream jets. The trade war between the two allies has intensified throughout 2025, with the average effective U.S. tariff rate reaching 16.8% by November.

Mexico is also facing tariff pressure. President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will seek alternate ways to help Cuba after Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on nations supplying Cuba with oil—Mexico being one of the last to do so.

Courts have consistently ruled against Trump's tariff authority, with the Court of International Trade declaring the "fentanyl" tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico invalid in May 2025. However, the administration has appealed these rulings. U.S. tariff revenue reached $287 billion in 2025—a 192% increase from 2024—while corporate bankruptcies rose to the highest level since 2010.

## Financial News (Top 15)

### 1. Silver Crashes 36% in Worst Day Since 1980 *(Jan 31, 10:00 AM)*

> Silver plummeted 36% from record highs to $78.29 per ounce in the worst single-day drop since the Hunt Brothers collapse in 1980, while gold crashed 21% from $5,600 to below $4,400, erasing approximately $15 trillion from precious metals markets.

The historic selloff was triggered by President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair, which markets interpreted as a signal of continued central bank independence and tight monetary policy. The "Warsh Shock" sent the dollar rallying and sparked massive profit-taking after gold and silver had surged 65% and 145% respectively in 2025.

CME Group raised margin requirements—gold to 8% from 6%, silver to 15% from 11%—forcing leveraged speculators out when volatility spiked. Wild price swings meant banks struggled to trade with investors as holding positions became too risky. "Once their willingness to quote prices in size faded, liquidity deteriorated further and volatility blew out," analysts explained.

Despite the crash, major banks maintain bullish targets: JPMorgan sees $6,300 gold, UBS targets $6,200, Deutsche Bank projects $6,000 by year-end. Gold remains up 8% year-to-date even after the correction. Central bank demand remains structurally strong as countries diversify away from dollar assets.

### 2. Bitcoin Crashes to 10-Month Lows Below $75,000 *(Feb 1, 8:00 AM)*

> Bitcoin tumbled to approximately $74,500, its lowest level since April 2025, marking a 40% decline from its October peak of $126,000 and triggering $2.5 billion in cryptocurrency liquidations over 24 hours.

More than 580,000 traders saw positions liquidated in 48 hours, with over 90% being long positions. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index plunged to 18 ("Extreme Fear"). Bitcoin's market depth dropped 30% below its October peak—the lowest since the FTX collapse. January marked the cryptocurrency's fourth straight monthly decline, the longest losing streak since 2018.

The crash coincided with the broader precious metals meltdown following the Warsh Fed nomination and the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate cuts. Bitcoin fell nearly 11% in January alone. Ethereum plunged nearly one-fifth of its value over the week while Solana's price was cut in half.

Forecasts range wildly from $40,000 to $200,000. Analyst Paul Howard stated: "I don't think we'll see a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2026." John Blank at Zacks suggested bitcoin could hit $40,000 this year. The broader crypto market remains highly correlated with bitcoin, confirming it "still dances to BTC's tune."

### 3. S&P 500 Rebounds to Record High Amid Volatility *(Feb 2, 4:00 PM)*

> The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to a fresh record high on Monday, with the Dow gaining 515 points (+1.1%) to 49,407 and the Nasdaq advancing 0.6% as stocks recovered from last week's precious metals and crypto turmoil.

Top performers included Caterpillar (+5.05%), Walmart (+4.14%), and Apple (+4.06%). Asian markets bounced with MSCI Asia Pacific jumping 2.4%—its best day since April. The S&P 500 is up 1.37% year-to-date, with energy leading sectors at 14.37% thanks to rising oil prices amid geopolitical turbulence and icy U.S. weather.

Goldman Sachs projects the S&P 500 to produce 12% total return in 2026, forecasting EPS growth of 12% with profit margins expanding 70 basis points. Bank of America targets 7,100 (3.7% upside), while Deutsche Bank sees 8,000 (17% upside) by year-end. Not a single surveyed analyst predicts a decline. If realized, 2026 would mark the fourth straight year of gains—the longest winning streak in nearly two decades.

However, valuations remain historically elevated, with the forward P/E at 22x versus a 30-year average of 17. The equity risk premium stands at just 0.02%—among the lowest on record—highlighting a market environment "largely devoid of a margin of safety."

### 4. Fed Holds Rates at 3.50%-3.75%; Warsh Nominated as Next Chair *(Jan 30, 2:00 PM)*

> The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 3.50%-3.75% at its first meeting of 2026, while President Trump nominated hawkish former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell when his term ends in May.

Governors Miran and Waller voted for a 25-basis-point cut, but the majority held firm. Chair Powell indicated cuts remain likely but only after tariff-related inflation effects prove temporary. The Fed is positioned to remain on hold through at least the first half of 2026. Analysts expect GDP growth around 2% with core inflation moderating to 2.7%.

The Warsh nomination triggered historic precious metals volatility as markets interpreted it as a signal of continued central bank independence and hawkish policy. Warsh served as Fed Governor from 2006-2011 during the Global Financial Crisis and is seen as a tight-money advocate. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett believes more rate cuts could eventually come with Warsh at the helm.

Senator Thom Tillis has vowed to block nominees until a Fed building renovation investigation is resolved, potentially delaying confirmation. Goldman Sachs projects US growth at 2.6% versus consensus 2.0%, citing reduced tariff drag, tax cuts, and easier financial conditions.

### 5. Palantir Surges on Blowout AI-Driven Earnings *(Feb 2, 5:00 PM)*

> Palantir Technologies jumped 11% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that crushed expectations, with revenue surging 70% year-over-year to $1.41 billion as government and commercial clients race to adopt its artificial intelligence tools.

The defense tech company reported adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share versus 23 cents expected. U.S. commercial sales jumped 137%, while government segment revenue grew 66%. CEO Alex Karp highlighted the ongoing adoption by the U.S. government as AI becomes central to defense and intelligence operations.

For fiscal 2026, Palantir guided to $7.18-7.20 billion in revenue, dramatically beating the $6.22 billion consensus estimate. The company forecast $1.53 billion in current quarter sales. The results were so strong that Jefferies analysts warned of "tougher comps ahead."

Palantir's performance helped ignite a broader rally in technology stocks. The company's success reflects the accelerating enterprise AI adoption trend, with the four hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—boosting combined capex to $470 billion from $350 billion in 2025.

### 6. Oil Prices Plunge 5% on US-Iran Talk Optimism *(Feb 2, 11:00 AM)*

> WTI crude fell more than 5% to $61.70 per barrel while Brent dropped to $65.92 as diplomatic progress with Iran reduced fears of Middle East supply disruptions, unwinding January's 14-16% rally.

President Trump confirmed Iran was "seriously talking" with the U.S., with nuclear negotiations scheduled for Friday in Istanbul. Iranian officials also signaled openness to diplomacy, helping calm markets that had priced in conflict risk. OPEC+ reaffirmed plans to keep output unchanged in March, with eight member countries pausing production increases.

The EIA forecasts Brent averaging $56 per barrel in 2026—19% below 2025 levels. The World Bank warned of a "massive oil glut" expected to reach 3 million barrels per day by year-end. Brent and WTI recorded annual losses of nearly 20% in 2025, the steepest since 2020 and the third straight year of losses for Brent—the longest such streak on record.

OPEC+ faces an uphill battle against structural oversupply. The eight participating countries reiterated that 1.65 million barrels per day may be returned "subject to evolving market conditions" in a gradual manner.

### 7. Natural Gas Plunges 20%+ in Single Session *(Feb 2, 1:00 PM)*

> The March natural gas contract dropped more than 20% in midday trading as weather patterns shifted and supply concerns eased, extending the extreme volatility that has characterized commodity markets this week.

The U.S. Natural Gas Fund (UNG) tumbled correspondingly. The dramatic move came after an extended rally driven by the polar vortex that brought freezing temperatures across the United States. The plunge underscored the extreme volatility in commodities alongside gold, silver, and crypto swings.

Energy sector performance remained strong overall despite the single-session gas crash. Energy led January sector returns at 14.37%, far outpacing the S&P 500's 1.37% gain. Materials took second place, followed by defensive consumer staples.

The gas market's wild swing reflects the broader theme of 2026's opening weeks: massive volatility across asset classes driven by policy uncertainty, weather, and shifting geopolitical dynamics.

### 8. Jobs Report Delayed Indefinitely Due to Government Shutdown *(Feb 2, 9:00 AM)*

> The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced it cannot release the January employment report as scheduled February 6, adding uncertainty to Federal Reserve policy assessments at a critical moment for monetary decisions.

BLS employees are furloughed and cannot collect or compile data. The release will be rescheduled upon funding resumption, though the timing remains uncertain as the partial shutdown extends. Nearly three-quarters of Labor Department staff received furlough notices.

December's report showed only 50,000 jobs added with downward revisions removing 76,000 from prior months. Unemployment fell to 4.4%. The data gap complicates Fed decision-making as policymakers try to assess the labor market's health amid tariff uncertainty and inflation concerns.

The delayed jobs report is one of several economic impacts from the shutdown, which affects Defense, Labor, HHS, Education, Transportation, HUD, State, and Treasury departments. Markets are navigating without key economic data at a time of heightened volatility.

### 9. Tech Giants Pledge $470B in AI Capex for 2026 *(Jan 30, 3:00 PM)*

> The four major cloud hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—announced combined 2026 capital expenditure plans of $470 billion, up from $350 billion in 2025, as AI infrastructure buildout accelerates.

Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion this year through debt and equity financing to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity for its largest OCI customers including AMD and Meta. The company is selling $25 billion in investment-grade bonds as part of the effort.

Microsoft shed 7.7% on increasing capex and marginally disappointing Azure cloud growth. Meta rallied 8.8% after raising its 2026 sales projection. Nvidia fell 2.9% on uncertainty over its stalled $100 billion OpenAI investment, though analysts remain bullish on $500 billion chip revenue visibility.

Fidelity International calls AI "the defining theme for equity markets" in 2026. BlackRock Investment Institute says the tech will "keep trumping tariffs and traditional macro drivers." However, some analysts question whether the massive spending will deliver returns, noting 167 S&P 500 companies have reported Q4 earnings with results 5% above consensus.

### 10. US Trade Deficit Nearly Doubles to $56.8 Billion *(Jan 28, 10:00 AM)*

> The goods and services trade deficit surged from $29.2 billion in October to $56.8 billion in November as exports decreased and imports increased, raising questions about the effectiveness of tariff policies aimed at reducing trade imbalances.

The widening gap came despite the Trump administration's aggressive tariff regime, which has pushed the average effective U.S. tariff rate to 16.8%. The November data predates the latest round of tariff escalations and trade deal announcements.

U.S. tariff revenue reached $287 billion in 2025, a 192% increase from 2024. However, the promised growth in manufacturing jobs has not materialized, and corporate bankruptcies rose to the highest level since 2010. Multiple courts have ruled against the administration's tariff authority, though appeals continue.

Analysts expect continued volatility in trade data as new agreements take effect. The China-U.S. trade truce saw Beijing lift rare earth export restrictions in November, while the US-India deal announced February 2 promises $500 billion in Indian purchases of American goods.

### 11. India Markets Surge on US Trade Deal *(Feb 2, 6:00 AM)*

> Nifty 50 jumped nearly 5% and the rupee strengthened to 90.40—its best day since November 2022—after President Trump announced a landmark trade agreement reducing tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%.

Twenty-seven of 30 Sensex stocks traded positive as trade war fears eased. The 18% U.S. tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors. Indian companies committed to over $500 billion in American purchases across energy, technology, agriculture, and coal. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal called it the "father of all deals."

India pledged to halt Russian oil purchases and "BUY AMERICAN" at significantly higher levels. However, analysts cautioned that legally binding text still needs to materialize. Prime Minister Modi notably did not mention Russian oil or tariff elimination in his response to Trump's announcement.

Questions remain about congressional approval requirements and implementation timeline. The deal ended a year-long tariff standoff between the two nations and represents a major diplomatic and economic realignment.

### 12. Gold Banks Maintain $6,000+ Targets Despite Historic Crash *(Feb 2, 10:00 AM)*

> JPMorgan, UBS, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale maintained bullish gold price forecasts despite last week's 21% crash, citing unchanged fundamental drivers including central bank demand and dollar diversification.

JPMorgan targets $6,300 per ounce, UBS raised its forecast to $6,200 with a $7,200 upside scenario. Deutsche Bank and SocGen project $6,000 by year-end. The World Bank forecasts precious metals rising 5% in 2026 overall.

Gold remains up 8% year-to-date and 69% year-over-year even after the correction. Spot gold recovered to around $4,938 per ounce on Tuesday after hitting lows near $4,400. Analysts described the crash as "a positioning reset rather than a sustained downturn."

Central bank demand remains structurally strong as countries diversify away from dollar assets. The gold-to-silver ratio hit extreme levels during the crash, suggesting silver may have overcorrected. Trader Peter Brandt expects a snap-back rally before another wave lower "that washes out speculators."

### 13. US Manufacturing Expands for First Time in 12 Months *(Feb 2, 10:30 AM)*

> Factory activity in January expanded for the first time in a year, with the ISM Manufacturing Index showing surges in new orders and production that signal potential economic resilience despite tariff uncertainty.

The expansion ended the longest manufacturing contraction streak since the 2008 financial crisis. Transport stocks hit new all-time highs with the Dow Jones Transportation Average up 2%, led by United Airlines, Old Dominion, and Delta.

Energy sector led January performance at 14.37%, followed by materials and consumer staples. Health care, info tech, and financials ended January lower. The sector rotation away from growth stocks reflects geopolitical turbulence driving commodity prices.

Goldman Sachs expects the U.S. to substantially outperform global growth forecasts (2.6% vs. 2.0% consensus) due to reduced tariff drag, tax cuts, and easier financial conditions. Analysts see the manufacturing rebound as a positive signal for the industrial economy.

### 14. ECB Expected to Hold Rates at February Meeting *(Feb 2, 7:00 AM)*

> The European Central Bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at 2% when it meets February 4-5, with analysts forecasting the ECB to remain on hold for most of 2026 amid stable inflation.

The ECB left borrowing costs unchanged for a fourth consecutive meeting in December, with the main refinancing rate at 2.15% and deposit facility rate at 2%. Swap markets price in stable rates through most of 2026 with a marginal uptick in implied rates for December.

"Our baseline forecast is for the ECB to keep rates at 2% throughout 2026, with a stance that we consider neutral," said Josefina Rodriguez at Vanguard. However, falling energy prices and inflation remaining below target suggest the stance tilts toward easing rather than tightening.

The Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia also meet this week. Markets anticipate over 70% probability the RBA will raise rates to 3.85% following surprisingly robust employment data and persistent inflation challenges in Australia.

### 15. S&P 500 Valuation Concerns at 22x Forward P/E *(Feb 2, 3:00 PM)*

> The S&P 500 trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22x—well above its 30-year average of 17—raising correction risk even as analysts unanimously project positive returns for 2026.

The median Wall Street forecast puts the S&P 500 at 7,600 by year-end, representing roughly 10% upside. Notably, not a single surveyed analyst predicts a decline. If realized, 2026 would mark the fourth straight year of gains—the longest winning streak in nearly two decades.

The equity risk premium stands at just 0.02%—among the lowest on record—as the S&P 500's forward earnings yield sits near parity with the 10-year Treasury. This highlights what analysts call a market environment "largely devoid of a margin of safety."

According to Goldman Sachs, the biggest risks are weaker than expected economic growth or a hawkish Fed shift, though "neither appears likely in the near future." The firm expects EPS to increase 12% in 2026 and 10% in 2027 with profit margins expanding 70 basis points.
