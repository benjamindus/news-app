## Geopolitical News (Top 15)

### 1. US and Taiwan Sign Historic Trade Deal Lowering Tariffs to 15% in Exchange for $85 Billion in Purchases
*Feb 13*

> Washington and Taipei signed a comprehensive reciprocal trade agreement that locks US tariffs on Taiwanese goods at 15%—matching rates for Japan and South Korea—while Taiwan commits to purchasing $85 billion in American energy, aircraft and power equipment, and agrees to eliminate or reduce 99% of its own tariff barriers on US imports.

The agreement lowers the general tariff on Taiwanese exports from 20% to 15%, with 2,072 items representing nearly 20% of Taiwan's total exports to the US exempt from reciprocal tariffs entirely and subject only to standard Most-Favored-Nation rates. The average US tariff on Taiwanese goods will drop to 12.33%, providing significant competitive advantages for the island's semiconductor, electronics, and manufacturing sectors.

Taiwan's investment commitments are substantial: at least $250 billion for semiconductor production facilities in the United States, $44.4 billion for liquefied natural gas and crude oil purchases, $15.2 billion for aircraft and engines, and $25.2 billion for power-generation equipment. Semiconductors and related products receive the most favorable treatment available under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act, protecting Taiwan's critical chip industry from future tariff threats.

The deal came together with remarkable speed, finalized just days before planned announcements, and represents a strategic victory for Taiwan amid escalating tensions with China. Beijing has criticized the agreement as undermining the One China policy and increasing separatist tendencies, while analysts note the pact significantly strengthens US-Taiwan economic ties at a moment when cross-strait relations remain dangerously tense.

### 2. Massive Iran Protest in Munich Draws 250,000 Demanding Regime Change as Pahlavi Calls for Global Action
*Feb 14*

> An estimated 250,000 demonstrators gathered in Munich during the Munich Security Conference in what organizers described as the largest Iranian opposition protest ever held in Europe, answering exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi's call for a "global day of action" to support Iranians struggling against the Islamic Republic's violent crackdown on dissent.

The demonstration took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where Pahlavi addressed world leaders and warned of continued bloodshed if "democracies stand by and watch" the regime's brutal suppression of protesters. German police confirmed the crowd size at approximately 250,000 people, who waved pre-revolutionary Iranian flags featuring the lion and sun emblem while chanting "Change, change, regime change" through the streets of Bavaria's capital.

Pahlavi's speech to the conference emphasized the urgency of international support: "We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?" The exiled crown prince, whose father was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has positioned himself as a symbol of democratic opposition to the current regime, though he carefully avoids claiming a right to the throne and instead advocates for a secular, democratic government chosen by Iranians.

The demonstration was part of coordinated rallies in Los Angeles, Toronto, and other cities with significant Iranian diaspora populations. The protests come amid renewed international focus on Iran following deadly crackdowns on domestic protesters, escalating nuclear tensions with the United States, and the Iranian government's recent sentencing of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to an additional seven years in prison.

### 3. UK Prime Minister Starmer Proposes Multinational Defense Initiative at Munich, Warns Europe Must Be "Ready to Fight"
*Feb 14*

> British Prime Minister Keir Starmer used his Munich Security Conference address to propose a new multilateral defense procurement initiative aimed at reducing rearmament costs while declaring that Europe must build "hard power" and prepare to fight if necessary, signaling a dramatic break from the "Britain of the Brexit years" toward deeper European security integration.

Starmer emphasized that "we are not at a crossroads today, the road ahead is straight, and it is clear we must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age." The speech represented the clearest articulation yet of the Labour government's vision for Britain's post-Brexit role, seeking to rebuild European partnerships without rejoining the EU while taking a leadership position on continental defense.

The UK will deploy its aircraft carrier group led by HMS Prince of Wales to the North Atlantic this year, operating alongside US, Canadian, and NATO allies in what Starmer called "a powerful show of our commitment to Euro-Atlantic security." The deployment aims to demonstrate British military capabilities and commitment to collective defense at a moment when questions about American reliability under President Trump have created uncertainty about NATO's future.

Starmer's proposed defense cooperation initiative focuses on coordinating arms procurement to drive down costs and accelerate rearmament across European nations. He called for "closer economic alignment" with the EU—a significant statement given Brexit sensitivities—and emphasized that collective defense investments must be paired with industrial cooperation to rebuild Europe's defense manufacturing capacity.

### 4. Japan's Prime Minister Takaichi Wins Historic Supermajority in Landslide Election Victory
*Feb 8*

> Japan's first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, led the Liberal Democratic Party to its biggest-ever electoral victory, winning 316 of 465 seats in the House of Representatives—a 68% majority representing the largest single-party dominance in Japan's post-war democratic history, with an unprecedented 90% of LDP candidates winning their races.

The early general election delivered Takaichi a supermajority sufficient to initiate constitutional amendments without coalition partners, achieving a long-held LDP goal of revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Takaichi announced she would pave the way for an eventual referendum on constitutional changes, particularly provisions limiting Japan's military capabilities and prohibiting collective self-defense operations.

The election took place after the LDP's 26-year coalition partnership with the centrist Komeito Party dissolved, replaced by a new alliance with the right-wing populist Japan Innovation Party. The political realignment reflects a broader shift toward nationalist policies, with Takaichi advocating for a "responsible but aggressive" fiscal stance, enhanced defense spending, and a harder line on regional security issues including China and North Korea.

Takaichi's overwhelming mandate provides political capital to pursue controversial policies, though her statements regarding Taiwan have already drawn sharp criticism from Beijing. China's foreign ministry urged Japan to "take concrete actions to demonstrate sincerity in upholding the political foundation of China-Japan relations," highlighting tensions that could define regional diplomacy throughout 2026.

### 5. Sudan Armed Forces Break Siege of Kadugli Amid Worsening Famine Crisis
*Feb 3*

> The Sudanese Armed Forces announced they broke through Rapid Support Forces lines to reopen supply routes to Kadugli in South Kordofan, ending a prolonged siege of the famine-stricken city, though humanitarian organizations warned the relief may be temporary without sustained access and a broader ceasefire in Sudan's devastating civil war.

The Famine Review Committee confirmed that famine conditions persist in Kadugli, where food consumption, acute malnutrition, and mortality have all surpassed famine thresholds. The city has been largely cut off from commercial supplies and humanitarian assistance since RSF forces surrounded it, creating one of the world's most severe ongoing famines alongside neighboring Dilling, which SAF forces reconnected in late January.

A sharp increase in drone attacks across the Kordofan region has endangered civilians and damaged critical infrastructure, with over a dozen attacks recorded in North Kordofan in the past week alone. Suspected drone strikes hit health facilities in Kadugli, reportedly killing four medical workers, demonstrating how the conflict continues to target civilian infrastructure despite international condemnation.

The war between Sudan's national army and the Rapid Support Forces has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with approximately 30 million people—two-thirds of Sudan's population—expected to need humanitarian assistance in 2026. More than 20 million require health assistance, while 21 million face acute food insecurity. Sudan now hosts the world's largest displacement crisis, with 13.6 million people uprooted—9.3 million internally displaced and 4.3 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries.

### 6. Democratic Republic of Congo Faces Worst Cholera Outbreak in 25 Years
*Feb 11*

> United Nations humanitarian officials called for an immediate scale-up of response to the worst cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 25 years, with more than 1,300 suspected cases and 35 deaths reported since the start of 2026, as conflict and displacement overwhelm health systems and sanitation infrastructure across the vast central African nation.

The Government, UN, and humanitarian partners continue providing support, but major gaps remain in water, sanitation, and hygiene services, health workers are overstretched, medical supplies are running low, and access to treatment facilities remains extremely difficult. The cholera outbreak has already tallied 64,427 total cases since the start of 2025, including 1,888 deaths, with children accounting for 14,818 cases and 340 deaths.

The UN's Central Emergency Response Fund allocated $750,000 to enable humanitarian partners working in healthcare to swiftly expand life-saving assistance and curb transmission rates. However, UNICEF requires approximately $6 million in 2026 to ensure the rapid response mechanism is properly funded, highlighting the significant resource gap between current funding and operational needs.

The spiraling outbreak reflects the broader humanitarian catastrophe gripping eastern DRC, where armed conflict, mass displacement, and collapsed infrastructure create ideal conditions for waterborne disease transmission. Overcrowded displacement camps, disrupted water systems, and limited healthcare access have created a public health emergency that threatens to spread beyond current hotspots if the international community fails to mobilize adequate resources.

### 7. Syria Displacement Crisis Worsens as Northeast Conflict Forces 200,000 to Flee
*Feb 2*

> Renewed violence and clashes in northeastern Syria have displaced almost 200,000 people—about half children—disrupting essential services and creating urgent humanitarian needs as fighting between Kurdish-led forces and rival groups intensifies despite a broader ceasefire agreement between the Syrian government and the Syrian Democratic Forces.

At least five children died in Ain Al Arab/Kobani due to lack of health services and winter supplies, underscoring the humanitarian consequences of displacement during winter months. As of January 25, more than 170,000 people had been forced to flee their homes across 178 communities in the northeast, mostly in Al-Hasakeh governorate, with the vast majority being women and children who face heightened risks of violence and abuse.

Nearly three-quarters of displaced families are living with host communities, putting additional strain on housing, water, basic services, and livelihoods in areas already facing challenging conditions. While some displaced persons have returned home, many remain unable to do so due to explosive ordnance contamination, damaged infrastructure, harsh winter conditions, and limited access to essential services.

Recent clashes and the displacement of families, coupled with the release of children from juvenile detention centers, have created urgent humanitarian needs for psychosocial support, case management, and services for unaccompanied and separated children. The displacement crisis complicates efforts to implement the US-backed ceasefire agreement between Damascus and the SDF, highlighting ongoing fragility in Syria's northeast even as other parts of the country see reduced violence.

### 8. Argentina Senate Approves Milei's Controversial Labor Reform Amid Violent Protests
*Feb 12*

> Argentina's 72-seat Senate approved President Javier Milei's contentious labor reform by a vote of 42-30 after a marathon 14-hour session, despite violent street protests outside Congress where demonstrators clashed with police using water cannons, rubber bullets, and tear gas, leaving at least 15 civilians and four police officers injured with around 30 people detained.

The labor reform increases daily working hours to up to 12 hours, weakens national trade unions by allowing collective bargaining at the company level, extends trial periods during which companies can fire new employees without cause, reduces corporate liability for workplace injuries, and unwinds complex severance payment systems that Milei argues make Argentine labor markets uncompetitive.

Thousands of workers mobilized by powerful trade unions converged on downtown Buenos Aires, blocking traffic and throwing Molotov cocktails, stones, and water bottles at security forces who responded with crowd control measures. The violence reflected deep opposition to reforms that union leaders describe as dismantling worker protections built over decades of labor organizing and political struggle.

The bill still requires approval by the Chamber of Deputies before becoming law, setting up another contentious legislative battle in the coming weeks. The reform has been widely rejected by Argentina's most important unions and opposition parties, who argue it will increase job insecurity, reduce wages, and shift power dramatically toward employers in labor disputes.

### 9. Mexico Senate Unanimously Approves 40-Hour Workweek Amendment
*Feb 11*

> Mexico's Senate unanimously approved a constitutional amendment to reduce the standard workweek from 48 to 40 hours through a gradual phase-in ending in 2030, marking a historic shift in Latin America's largest economy as the country seeks to improve work-life balance without cutting wages or benefits for an estimated 13.4 million workers.

The reform implements a graduated reduction timeline: 46 hours per week beginning January 1, 2027, followed by 44 hours in 2028, 42 hours in 2029, and reaching 40 hours by 2030. The amendment explicitly prohibits wage reductions, meaning employees will work fewer hours while maintaining current compensation levels—a provision that has drawn concern from business groups about increased labor costs.

In addition to reducing weekly hours, the labor reform establishes a 12-hour maximum workday cap and mandates double pay for overtime hours 9-12. Supporters argue the changes will improve worker health, productivity, and family life, while critics warn the reform could reduce Mexico's competitiveness and increase unemployment as businesses adjust to higher effective labor costs.

Opposition lawmakers and some union leaders have criticized the proposal as watered-down, arguing it leaves loopholes that would not substantially reduce weekly workloads and allows businesses too much time to adjust. The amendment now moves to the Chamber of Deputies for final debate and expected approval before implementation begins on Labor Day, May 1, 2026.

### 10. Thailand's Ruling Bhumjaithai Party Wins Surprise Election Victory
*Feb 8*

> Thailand's conservative Bhumjaithai Party secured a stunning election victory, winning 193 seats in the House of Representatives and marking the first time this century that a party aligned with the country's royalist establishment has won at the ballot box, delivering a clear defeat to the emerging progressive movement represented by the second-place People's Party.

General elections held on February 8 saw Prime Minister Anutin Chittchawong's Bhumjaithai Party substantially outperform pre-election polls, defeating the People's Party (118 seats) and Pheu Thai (74 seats). The result surprised political analysts who expected a closer race, with unofficial results showing more than 57% of voters also supported drafting a new constitution in a concurrent referendum.

The election represents Thailand's first major democratic test since years of political turbulence, military coups, and constitutional crises that defined the 2010s and early 2020s. Bhumjaithai's victory on a conservative platform emphasizing stability, monarchist values, and traditional Thai culture suggests voters prioritized continuity over the democratic reforms championed by progressive parties.

The outcome has significant implications for Thailand's role in regional geopolitics, particularly regarding relations with China and the United States. Bhumjaithai's pro-establishment orientation likely means continued careful balancing between the major powers while maintaining Thailand's traditional foreign policy pragmatism, though the party's specific policy agenda on international affairs remains to be fully articulated.

### 11. African Union Summit Elects Burundi's President as New Chair Amid Continental Crises
*Feb 14*

> The 39th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa elected President Évariste Ndayishimiye of Burundi as the organization's Chairperson for 2026, taking over from Angola's João Lourenço, as African leaders confronted conflicts in Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Mali while UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for institutional reforms to give Africa greater voice in multilateral decision-making.

The summit convened under the theme "Assuring Sustainable Water Availability and Safe Sanitation Systems to Achieve the Goals of Agenda 2063," though peace and security dominated discussions as the continent grapples with multiple armed conflicts, climate extremes, and humanitarian emergencies. The Peace and Security Council's report examined developments in Libya, Sudan, Somalia, and Mali, with particular concern about Sudan's escalating civil war and its spillover effects.

UN Secretary-General Guterres told the summit that "this is 2026—not 1946," pressing his case for fundamental reform of global institutions including the UN Security Council to reflect Africa's population and strategic importance. His comments referenced ongoing frustration that Africa lacks permanent representation on the Security Council despite hosting more than a quarter of UN member states.

The summit also addressed economic competitiveness, climate resilience, and water security challenges facing the continent. The election of Ndayishimiye as chair drew some controversy given Burundi's human rights record, but proponents argued his leadership could bring fresh attention to Great Lakes region security issues and climate adaptation challenges.

### 12. Canada and Germany Launch Sovereign Technology Alliance on AI Cooperation
*Feb 14*

> Canada's Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation and Germany's Minister for Digital Transformation and Government Modernization signed a Joint Declaration of Intent on Artificial Intelligence and launched the Sovereign Technology Alliance on the margins of the Munich Security Conference, establishing a framework for democratic nations to cooperate on advanced technologies while ensuring strategic autonomy from authoritarian competitors.

The Sovereign Technology Alliance creates a platform for practical cooperation on advanced technologies with a focus on delivering real capability and shared economic benefit among trusted partners. Cooperation under the joint declaration will focus on expanding secure compute infrastructure, accelerating AI research and commercialization, and strengthening talent development to address critical skills gaps in both countries.

The initiative builds on the Canada-Germany Digital Alliance announced in December 2025 and reflects both nations' view that advanced technologies are central to economic security, competitiveness, and democratic resilience. The agreement comes amid growing concerns about China's dominance in AI hardware supply chains and authoritarian governments' use of AI for surveillance and social control.

Officials emphasized that the alliance aims to ensure democracies lead in AI development and deployment while establishing governance frameworks that protect civil liberties, privacy, and human rights. The partnership could serve as a model for broader transatlantic cooperation on emerging technologies, potentially expanding to include additional European nations and other democratic partners.

### 13. Trump Administration Removes Pride Flags from Stonewall National Monument
*Feb 10*

> The Trump administration ordered the National Park Service to remove LGBTQ Pride flags from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City—the United States' first national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights—following a directive restricting non-agency flags from flying on federal property, sparking immediate backlash from local officials who re-raised the flag in defiance.

A National Park Service memorandum prohibited "non-agency flags and pennants" except for the US flag and Interior Department flag from being displayed at national monuments and parks. The removal from Stonewall, site of the 1969 uprising that catalyzed the modern LGBTQ rights movement, drew particular criticism as symbolically erasing recognition of the community's history and contributions.

New York City officials, including Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal, condemned the move as "part of the Trump administration's attempt to reshape the Park Service in a manner that conforms with his right-wing base of support, excluding minority groups and LGBTQ people." Local leaders raised the Pride flag again days after its removal, declaring they would not allow the monument's significance to be diminished.

The flag removal represents the latest in a series of Trump administration actions affecting LGBTQ recognition at federal sites and institutions, part of a broader effort to alter displays at national parks and cultural institutions to reflect conservative values. The controversy highlights ongoing culture war battles over representation, historical interpretation, and the role of federal institutions in acknowledging diverse American experiences.

### 14. Trump Administration Plans to Roll Back Steel and Aluminum Tariffs
*Feb 13*

> President Trump's administration plans to scale back some tariffs on steel and aluminum products after officials concluded the levies are hurting consumers by raising prices for goods including pie tins and food-and-drink cans, according to reports from the Financial Times, sending steel stocks tumbling as investors priced in reduced pricing power for domestic producers.

The Trump administration is reviewing a list of products affected by steel and aluminum tariffs and plans to exempt some items, halt expansion of the affected product lists, and launch more targeted national security probes into specific goods instead of maintaining blanket duties. Officials in the Commerce Department and US Trade Representative's office believe current tariff structures impose unnecessary costs on manufacturers and consumers.

Steelmakers Nucor and Steel Dynamics fell about 5% each on the news, while Cleveland-Cliffs slid 7% as investors anticipated lower realized pricing for domestic steel products. The potential rollback represents a significant reversal after the administration doubled steel tariffs from 25% to 50% for most trading partners in June 2025 to protect domestic manufacturing.

The policy shift reflects growing political pressure as cost-of-living concerns become a major factor heading into November midterm elections. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed only 30% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the rising cost of living, while 59% disapproved, creating incentives for the administration to demonstrate responsiveness to inflation concerns even if it means moderating trade protectionism.

### 15. Venezuela Tensions with China Emerge Over Oil Pricing After Maduro Capture
*Feb 4*

> Venezuela dismissed reports that the United States would influence oil pricing with China following President Nicolás Maduro's capture in early January, with the Venezuelan ambassador to Beijing stating Caracas would not abide by Washington's arrangements, highlighting diplomatic tensions over who will control Venezuela's oil policies in the post-Maduro era.

The Trump administration conducted a large-scale military operation in early January that resulted in Maduro's capture, with the US subsequently moving to assert influence over Venezuela's oil sector through sanctions and negotiated oil sales. Venezuela produces approximately 800,000 barrels per day—a relatively modest amount by global standards but strategically important for China's energy diversification.

Venezuelan crude is a heavy, sour grade useful for industrial products such as diesel and jet fuel but not of the quality typically refined into gasoline, limiting its immediate market impact. The oil market reaction to Maduro's capture was surprisingly muted, with analysts telling major news outlets that the government overthrow is unlikely to disrupt global oil markets significantly given Venezuela's modest production levels.

By February, diplomatic friction emerged as China—Venezuela's largest foreign creditor and a major purchaser of Venezuelan oil—objected to US efforts to dictate commercial terms. The Venezuelan government's assertion of independence in setting oil prices for Chinese sales demonstrates that despite Maduro's capture, the political situation remains fluid and the new government's relationship with international partners is still being negotiated.

## Financial News (Top 15)

### 1. Congressional Budget Office Projects Federal Debt to Reach 120% of GDP by 2036
*Feb 11*

> The Congressional Budget Office released its February 2026 Budget and Economic Outlook projecting federal debt held by the public will rise from 99% of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2025 to a record 120% by 2036, while annual deficits grow from $1.8 trillion (5.8% of GDP) to $3.1 trillion (6.7% of GDP), dramatically exceeding sustainable fiscal targets.

CBO projects the deficit for fiscal year 2026 at $1.9 trillion, growing steadily to $3.1 trillion by 2036—averaging more than twice the often-cited 3% of GDP sustainability threshold. The projections incorporate recent legislation including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, new tariff policies, stronger near-term economic growth, higher interest rates, decreased immigration, and various other policy changes enacted since the previous baseline.

The new baseline shows deficits will be $1.4 trillion higher through 2035 than CBO projected just one year ago in January 2025, reflecting the fiscal impact of tax cuts, spending increases, and reduced revenue assumptions. Real GDP growth is projected at 2.2% in 2026 before slowing to an average of 1.8% per year from 2027 to 2036, suggesting modest economic expansion insufficient to close fiscal gaps through growth alone.

The deteriorating fiscal outlook has yet to trigger significant bond market concern, with Treasury yields remaining relatively stable despite the projections. However, the trajectory raises questions about long-term fiscal sustainability, the federal government's capacity to respond to future crises, and the potential for a sovereign debt crisis if investor confidence in US creditworthiness erodes.

### 2. Cisco Shares Fall 12% Despite Earnings Beat on Disappointing Current Quarter Guidance
*Feb 11*

> Cisco Systems shares plunged 12% after the networking hardware maker reported better-than-expected quarterly results but issued disappointing guidance for the current period, raising concerns about demand for traditional networking equipment amid the industry's pivot toward AI infrastructure and cloud-native architectures.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 versus $1.02 expected and revenue of $15.35 billion versus $15.12 billion expected, representing approximately 10% growth from $14 billion a year earlier. Networking revenue increased 21% in the period, while AI infrastructure orders from hyperscale cloud providers totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter.

For the current period ending April 2026, Cisco expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 to $1.04 and revenue of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion. While the guidance appears solid on the surface, investors were disappointed that AI infrastructure demand is not accelerating networking revenue more dramatically, given enormous capital expenditures by cloud providers building AI data centers.

The stock decline reflects broader questions about which technology companies will ultimately capture value from the AI infrastructure buildout. While Cisco benefits from selling switches and networking equipment to data centers, the company faces intense competition from newer entrants and pressure from hyperscale customers developing proprietary networking technologies to reduce dependence on traditional vendors.

### 3. Spotify Shares Surge 15% on Record Profitability and Strong User Growth
*Feb 10*

> Spotify Technology beat estimated earnings by 74.92%, reporting EPS of $5.16 versus an estimate of $2.95, as the music streaming platform closed 2025 with over €2.2 billion in net profits—representing a 94% increase from the prior year—sending shares soaring 15% as investors celebrated the company's transition to sustained profitability.

The popular music platform grew users by 11% and paying subscribers by 10% during 2025, marking its highest quarter ever for monthly active user net additions. The strong performance demonstrates Spotify's successful navigation of competitive pressures from Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music while maintaining pricing power with both consumers and record labels.

Spotify's profitability transformation reflects multiple factors: price increases in key markets, improved gross margins through renegotiated licensing agreements, reduced marketing expenses as brand recognition drives organic growth, and successful expansion of higher-margin products including audiobooks and podcasts. The company has shifted from prioritizing growth at any cost to balancing subscriber acquisition with margin expansion.

Looking ahead, Spotify faces continued challenges including ongoing negotiations with record labels over royalty rates, competitive pressure from tech giants with deeper pockets, and the need to demonstrate that recent price increases won't trigger subscriber defections. However, the record profitability provides financial flexibility to invest in content, technology, and international expansion while returning value to shareholders.

### 4. Housing Market Posts Sharp Decline as January Existing Home Sales Fall 8.4%
*Feb 12*

> Existing-home sales—including single-family homes, townhomes, condos and co-ops—posted an 8.4% drop in January compared to December and were down 4.4% from a year ago, bringing sales to 3.91 million units annually and raising concerns about the spring selling season despite improved affordability conditions compared to recent years.

The median sales price reached $396,800, while inventory stood at 3.7 months of supply—still below the 6-month level typically considered balanced between buyers and sellers. The sharp monthly decline surprised analysts who expected improving affordability from lower mortgage rates to stimulate transaction volumes as the crucial spring home-buying season approaches.

Despite the recent sales decline, housing is the most affordable it has been since March 2022, due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates declining from pandemic-era peaks. However, supply constraints remain the fundamental challenge, with new construction failing to keep pace with household formation and many homeowners locked into low-rate mortgages from 2020-2021 unwilling to sell and refinance at higher rates.

National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun projected existing-home sales will rise by around 14% in 2026, though more conservative forecasts suggest approximately 1.7% growth to 4.13 million transactions—slightly above 2025's 30-year low. The divergence in forecasts reflects uncertainty about how consumers will respond to improved but still-challenging affordability conditions.

### 5. Alkermes Completes $2.1 Billion Acquisition of Avadel Pharmaceuticals
*Feb 12*

> Alkermes plc completed its acquisition of Avadel Pharmaceuticals, a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, in a transaction valued at approximately $2.1 billion, adding Avadel's FDA-approved narcolepsy treatment LUMRYZ to Alkermes' commercial portfolio and accelerating its entry into the sleep medicine market.

Avadel shareholders received $21.00 in cash per share plus one contingent value right that may pay an additional $1.50 per share if specified milestones are met, representing a 38% premium to the weighted average trading price over the three months prior to the announcement. Alkermes funded the all-cash transaction with approximately $750 million from its balance sheet and $1.525 billion in term loans due 2031.

LUMRYZ (sodium oxybate) treats cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients over 7 years of age with narcolepsy. The acquisition expands Alkermes' neuroscience portfolio and late-stage pipeline in sleep and other neurological disorders, complementing the company's existing psychiatry and oncology franchises.

The transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2026 and to enhance Alkermes' revenue growth profile. The deal reflects broader consolidation in specialty pharmaceuticals as companies seek to acquire commercial-stage assets with established revenue streams rather than investing in risky early-stage drug development, particularly in therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical need like sleep disorders.

### 6. Gold Prices Plunge 9% in Historic Selloff Before Recovering Near $5,000
*Feb 6*

> Gold prices fell more than 9% in a single day—the sharpest one-day drop since 1983—following President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair, before recovering to trade near $5,000 per ounce as investors reassessed the implications for monetary policy and the dollar.

The historic rout saw spot gold tumble from above $5,550 to below $4,500 before staging a partial recovery. The selloff was triggered by Warsh's nomination, which markets interpreted as potentially signaling a more hawkish stance on inflation and a stronger US dollar, both of which typically weigh on dollar-denominated commodities like gold.

Despite the volatility, gold has since stabilized near $5,000 and remains up dramatically from $2,700 levels seen twelve months ago, reflecting ongoing structural drivers including geopolitical uncertainty, massive central bank purchases, concerns about Federal Reserve independence, and portfolio diversification away from traditional dollar-denominated assets.

Daily technical analysis shows gold prices bouncing from the $4,500 support level and consolidating in a triangle pattern between $4,900 and $5,100, with official-sector demand remaining strong as China's central bank extended its gold purchases for a fifteenth consecutive month in January. J.P. Morgan's analysts project gold could test $5,400-5,600 if the current consolidation resolves to the upside.

### 7. Stock Market Falls Sharply as AI Disruption Fears Override Inflation Relief
*Feb 12*

> The S&P 500 dropped 1.57% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.03% as investors worried about the negative side of artificial intelligence buildouts, which threaten to disrupt business models across entire industries and potentially raise unemployment, overwhelming positive sentiment from cooler-than-expected inflation data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 669.42 points or 1.34% to close at 49,451.98, extending losses from earlier in the week despite inflation data that showed consumer prices rising less than forecast. Technology stocks led declines, with software and services companies particularly hard hit as investors assessed which firms face existential threats from AI-powered automation.

Earlier in the week, the S&P 500 had slipped 0.33% on Tuesday as weaker-than-expected retail sales data combined with AI disruption concerns to offset optimism about potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The market volatility reflects growing tension between the promise of AI-driven productivity gains and the risk that rapid technological change could displace workers and disrupt established companies faster than new opportunities emerge.

The selloff came despite a stronger-than-anticipated jobs report showing 130,000 nonfarm payroll additions in January versus expectations of 55,000, suggesting the labor market remains resilient. However, investors appear increasingly focused on longer-term structural questions about which companies and industries will thrive in an AI-transformed economy rather than near-term cyclical indicators.

### 8. Small-Cap Stocks Outperform as US Equity Market Trades at 5% Discount to Fair Value
*Feb 9*

> Small-cap stocks outperformed the broad market over the past three months yet remain trading at a 13% discount to fair value estimates, representing one of the most attractive investment categories according to Morningstar's analysis, while the overall US equity market trades at a 5% discount to composite fair value estimates.

The Morningstar US Market Index rose 1.50% during January, but the composite of fair value estimates rose faster, increasing the market discount to 5% from 4% the previous month. The analysis suggests that despite strong recent performance, US stocks offer reasonable value for long-term investors, particularly compared to many international markets trading near or above fair value.

A significant rotation occurred from mega-cap technology stocks to less-loved areas of the market, with the Russell 1000 Growth Index falling 1.5% in January while the Russell 1000 Value Index jumped 4.6%. Small-cap stocks have particularly benefited from this rotation, with investors seeking exposure to companies positioned to benefit from domestic economic growth and potentially less exposed to AI disruption risks.

The February 9 market session saw the S&P 500 slip back into negative territory as investors digested mixed economic signals and ongoing concerns about technology sector valuations. The analysis indicates investors are becoming more selective, favoring companies with established cash flows and reasonable valuations over high-multiple growth stocks dependent on speculative future earnings.

### 9. Coca-Cola and T-Mobile Report Earnings as Corporate Results Continue Strong Performance
*Feb 10-12*

> Major corporations including Coca-Cola, Ford, and T-Mobile reported quarterly earnings during the week of February 9-13, with results generally meeting or exceeding expectations despite consumer spending pressures and continued economic uncertainty about the impact of tariffs and Federal Reserve policy.

Coca-Cola reported earnings on Tuesday, projecting 2026 organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% while noting demand for its drinks has fallen as budget-conscious shoppers try to save more on grocery bills. The more cautious outlook reflects persistent inflation pressures on lower-income consumers who are trading down to private-label beverages or reducing discretionary purchases.

T-Mobile US reported earnings on Wednesday, holding its Q4 2025 Earnings Call and Capital Markets Day Update on February 11 at 8:30 AM ET. Ford Motor Company also reported Tuesday, completing a significant week for corporate earnings with more than 70 S&P 500 companies releasing results.

The earnings reports came during a volatile period for markets, with investors closely scrutinizing forward guidance for signs of how companies expect tariffs, wage inflation, and consumer spending trends to affect profitability in 2026. The general pattern showed continued earnings resilience despite macroeconomic headwinds, though forward guidance reflected increased caution about the remainder of the year.

### 10. Federal Reserve Holds Rates at 3.5%-3.75% as Officials Signal Patience on Further Cuts
*Feb 5*

> The Federal Reserve maintained its key interest rate in a range between 3.5% and 3.75% at its January meeting, putting a halt to three consecutive quarter-percentage-point reductions from late 2025, as fresh inflation readings showed prices remain sticky and policymakers emphasized a cautious "wait and see" approach to monetary policy.

The decision followed inflation data showing consumer and wholesale prices remain elevated, underscoring expectations that Federal Reserve officials will not cut interest rates in the near term. The median FOMC projection forecasts an inflation rate of 2.4% by the end of 2026, down from 2.6% in September, but still above the Fed's 2% target.

Futures markets are pricing in at most two rate reductions in 2026 and none in 2027, reflecting expectations the Fed will wait until at least June before adjusting its benchmark rate again. The cautious stance represents a significant shift from earlier expectations that falling inflation would enable an aggressive easing cycle in 2026.

President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair to succeed Jerome Powell in May has added uncertainty to the monetary policy outlook. While Warsh is known to be in Trump's orbit and has recently called for lower interest rates, he is expected to stop short of the more aggressive easing associated with some other potential candidates, suggesting the Fed will likely maintain a data-dependent approach regardless of leadership changes.

### 11. Producer Price Index Jumps 0.5% as Businesses Begin Passing Tariff Costs to Consumers
*Feb 2*

> The Producer Price Index increased 0.5% in December—more than double the forecast of 0.2%—driven by a 0.7% surge in service prices, as businesses signal they are beginning to pass tariff costs down the supply chain after absorbing the majority of duties in 2025.

Core goods PPI rose 0.4% in December, pointing to continued pass-through of tariffs into wholesale prices. JPMorgan estimates businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that proportion could flip to just 20% absorption in 2026 as inventory stockpiles run out and price increases become unavoidable, setting the stage for renewed consumer inflation pressures.

The jump in wholesale prices fits into a wider trend of "deglobalization inflation," where tariffs and supply chain domestication are raising the floor for prices across goods and services. With businesses passing more tariff costs to consumers, forecasters project US inflation rising to 2.7% in 2026 from current levels, complicating the Federal Reserve's efforts to return inflation to its 2% target.

Service sector price increases of 0.7%—the largest gain since July—suggest inflation pressures are broadening beyond goods affected by tariffs. Wage growth, commercial real estate costs, and business services expenses are all contributing to wholesale price gains that will eventually flow through to consumer prices in industries from healthcare to hospitality.

### 12. European Central Bank Holds Rates at 2% for Fifth Consecutive Meeting
*Feb 5*

> The European Central Bank maintained its key policy rate at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, with policymakers emphasizing that inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move despite eurozone inflation cooling to 1.7% in January—below the ECB's 2% target for the first time in years.

The decision comes amid heightened economic uncertainty, with ECB officials monitoring the euro's recent appreciation and its potential disinflationary effects on the economy. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll predicted the ECB would leave rates unchanged for the remainder of 2026, reflecting expectations that inflation will remain contained even as growth remains subdued.

The ECB's cautious stance contrasts with more aggressive rate-cutting cycles in some other major economies but aligns with the Bank of England, which also held rates at 3.75% in February by a narrow 5-4 vote. The close vote reflects divisions on the committee about when to begin cutting rates, with some policymakers concerned about persistent services inflation while others worry about weak economic growth.

The divergent monetary policy paths across major central banks reflect different inflation dynamics, labor market conditions, and growth trajectories as the global economy navigates the post-pandemic adjustment period. The eurozone faces particular challenges from energy price volatility, fiscal constraints in major economies like Germany, and uncertainty about US trade policy under the Trump administration.

### 13. S&P 500 Earnings Growth Hits 13% in Q4 2025 Marking Fifth Consecutive Quarter of Double-Digit Expansion
*Feb 6*

> Corporate America reported blended earnings growth of 13.0% for the fourth quarter of 2025, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of annual earnings expansion and the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth, as 76% of companies reporting beat analyst expectations with aggregate earnings 7.6% above estimates.

With 59% of S&P 500 companies having reported Q4 results, ten sectors are delivering year-over-year revenue growth, led by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Health Care sectors. Technology sector earnings exploded 25% year-over-year, driven by AI infrastructure investments and strong cloud computing demand.

Wall Street analysts are projecting earnings growth rates of 11.3% for Q1 2026 and 14.9% for Q2 2026, with full calendar year 2026 expected to deliver 14.1% earnings expansion. The optimistic forecasts reflect expectations that AI-driven productivity gains, moderating inflation, and potential interest rate cuts will support profit margins even as revenue growth faces tougher comparisons.

However, the earnings strength masks significant divergence between AI beneficiaries and the broader market. Technology giants investing heavily in AI infrastructure are reporting explosive revenue and profit growth, while traditional cyclical sectors face margin pressure from tariffs, wage inflation, and slowing global demand. The concentration of earnings growth in a handful of mega-cap stocks raises questions about the sustainability of market valuations if AI monetization disappoints.

### 14. Oil Prices Hold Near $63 as Iran Tensions Create Risk Premium Amid Oversupply Concerns
*Feb 6*

> West Texas Intermediate crude settled above $63 per barrel after a volatile week that saw prices whipsaw on US-Iran tensions, upcoming nuclear talks, and competing concerns about global oversupply as production surges from non-OPEC+ countries outpace demand growth projections.

Oil markets rallied earlier in the week on geopolitical risk premium following US military deployments to the Gulf and threats of strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but gave back gains as diplomatic talks scheduled in Muscat reduced immediate conflict probability. Iran's seizure of two oil tankers near Farsi Island added modest upward pressure but failed to sustain momentum amid fundamental concerns about supply-demand balance.

OPEC+ extended production cuts through Q1 2026, attempting to support prices as surging output from Brazil, Argentina, Guyana, and US shale producers threatens to create oversupply conditions. Latin America's three emerging oil powers are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing Venezuela's recovery despite sanctions relief.

Energy analysts project crude prices will remain range-bound in the $60-70 range through mid-2026 barring major geopolitical shocks, with the balance between growing non-OPEC supply and uncertain global demand creating a cap on price appreciation. Chinese economic weakness, electric vehicle adoption acceleration, and efficiency gains in transportation continue to moderate long-term demand forecasts.

### 15. Japanese Yen Posts Best Week Since November 2024 as Takaichi Election Victory Eases Fiscal Concerns
*Feb 8*

> The Japanese yen posted its strongest weekly performance since November 2024 following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory, as currency markets interpreted the LDP's supermajority as providing political stability and reducing concerns about unsustainable fiscal expansion.

The yen strengthened against the dollar and other major currencies as investors reassessed Japan's fiscal trajectory under Takaichi's leadership. While the new prime minister has advocated for continued accommodative fiscal policy and enhanced defense spending, the electoral mandate provides her government with political capital to implement reforms without resorting to unsustainable deficit spending to maintain coalition support.

Currency analysts noted that the election result reduced political uncertainty that had weighed on the yen during the campaign period. The supermajority means Takaichi can pursue her policy agenda without making costly concessions to coalition partners, potentially allowing for more disciplined fiscal management even while increasing spending in priority areas like defense and technology.

The yen's strength also reflects broader shifts in currency markets as investors rotate away from dollar exposure amid concerns about US fiscal sustainability, Federal Reserve independence, and the impact of Trump administration policies on long-term dollar demand. Japanese government bonds rallied alongside the yen, with 10-year yields declining as domestic and foreign investors sought safe-haven exposure.
