### 1. New START Nuclear Treaty Expires, Ending Last US-Russia Arms Control Agreement
*Feb 5*

> The landmark New START treaty officially expired on February 5, leaving the world's two largest nuclear superpowers without binding limits on strategic nuclear weapons for the first time in decades, as President Trump called for a "new, improved and modernised" replacement while UN Secretary-General warned of a "grave moment" for global security.

The treaty, which limited each nation to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 700 deployed delivery systems, could not be extended because it permitted only one five-year extension—which was exercised in 2021. Today, there are no negotiations underway, and none are even planned, leaving the arms control architecture that helped prevent nuclear escalation during the Cold War in ruins.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the expiration represents a critical juncture for international peace and security, as binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons fall away amid heightened global tensions. Without New START, arms control experts warn that both nations could hedge against uncertainty by expanding their arsenals over time, potentially triggering unrestricted nuclear competition not seen since the 1960s.

President Trump stated that "we should have our nuclear experts work on a new, improved and modernised treaty," but provided no details on timeline or negotiating framework. Russia has repeatedly indicated it will not engage in arms control talks while the US supports Ukraine militarily, creating a diplomatic impasse that leaves the world entering uncharted territory without legally binding constraints on the arsenals that contain 90% of global nuclear weapons.

### 2. United States Accuses China of Secret 2020 Nuclear Test, Presses for Trilateral Arms Treaty
*Feb 6*

> The Trump administration accused China of conducting a secret nuclear explosive test in June 2020 and using "decoupling" techniques to hide it from international monitors, as Washington called for a new trilateral arms control agreement including Russia and China to replace the expired New START framework.

Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Thomas DiNanno made the allegations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, stating that China sought to conceal the June 22, 2020 explosion by "obfuscating the explosions" through methods designed to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring. The timing of the accusation—just one day after New START expired—appeared calculated to build pressure for Beijing to join arms control negotiations.

However, the allegations faced immediate contradiction from international monitoring organizations. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization stated its system "did not detect any event consistent with the characteristics of a nuclear weapon test explosion" on June 22, 2020, with subsequent analyses not altering that determination. The discrepancy raised questions about US intelligence assessments and diplomatic strategy.

China's Embassy spokesperson rejected the allegations, stating that China "follows a policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense, and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium." Beijing has repeatedly refused to participate in arms control negotiations, arguing that such treaties would unfairly constrain its military development and prevent it from achieving parity with the US and Russia, whose arsenals are roughly ten times larger than China's estimated 500 warheads.

### 3. Congress Passes $50 Billion Foreign Aid Bill Despite Trump's Proposed 79% Cut
*Feb 6*

> Congress allocated $50 billion for foreign aid in fiscal year 2026—a 16% reduction from 2025 levels—rejecting the Trump administration's budget request for just $31 billion that would have represented a 79% cut when including proposed rescissions and cancellations.

The legislation brings an end to most forms of traditional US civilian assistance and formally shutters the US Agency for International Development (USAID), redirecting tens of billions of dollars toward domestic priorities, border enforcement, and selected security commitments. The budget eliminates $6.2 billion in global health spending, $3.2 billion in humanitarian aid, and $1.6 billion in food assistance provisions that had been cornerstones of American development policy for decades.

In place of traditional development aid, the legislation creates the America First Opportunity Fund, a $2.9 billion program restricted to expenditures that directly advance US economic or national security interests. The shift represents a fundamental reorientation of American foreign policy away from soft power investments and toward transactional relationships focused on immediate strategic returns.

While Congress provided significantly more funding than the administration requested, the $50 billion still marks a dramatic retreat from the $58.8 billion allocated in fiscal year 2025. Development advocates warned that the cuts will undermine America's ability to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative, damage relationships with developing nations, and create humanitarian crises that could ultimately require more expensive military interventions.

### 4. Syrian Government and Kurdish SDF Implement Ceasefire Agreement in Al-Hasakah
*Feb 2*

> The Syrian army moved into the northeastern city of Al-Hasakah under a US-backed ceasefire agreement with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, beginning a gradual integration process that could reshape the balance of power in northeastern Syria after years of autonomous Kurdish administration.

On January 30, the Syrian transitional government announced it had reached a comprehensive agreement with the SDF including a ceasefire, gradual military and administrative integration, deployment of Interior Ministry forces in Al-Hasakah and Qamishli, integration of local institutions into the state, guarantees of civil and educational rights for the Kurdish community, and the return of displaced persons. On February 2, General Security Service forces began deploying to implement the framework.

The United States hailed the agreement as a historic milestone toward unity and reconciliation after 14 years of war. The deal establishes a framework for incorporating SDF fighters into Syria's national army and police forces while integrating civilian institutions controlled by the group into the central government structure—a process that will test whether Damascus can accommodate Kurdish autonomy demands while asserting sovereignty.

The implementation comes as Turkey continues to pressure Kurdish forces along Syria's northern border, creating a complex three-way dynamic between Damascus, Ankara, and Washington. The outcome will significantly impact regional stability, the future of US military presence in eastern Syria, and the broader question of how post-civil war Syria manages its diverse ethnic and political factions.

### 5. Pakistan Concludes Massive Balochistan Counterterrorism Operation, 216 Militants Killed
*Feb 5*

> Pakistan's military concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1, a week-long counterterrorism campaign in Balochistan province that killed 216 militants of the Balochistan Liberation Army following coordinated attacks on security installations, a high-security prison, and civilian areas across the province.

The operation was launched on January 29 in response to BLA's "Operation Herof 2.0," which involved armed assaults and suicide bombings targeting security installations, police stations, and civilian areas. Multiple attacks were attempted and carried out in Quetta, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kalat, Gwadar, Pasni, Tump, and Mastung. Around 31 civilians and 22 security personnel were also killed during the violence that triggered the military response.

Pakistani security forces stated that the 40-hour operation resulted in the deaths of 216 militants and insurgents, according to the Armed Forces' media wing, the ISPR. The offensive included deployment of helicopters and drones to end the standoff with Baloch rebels, with the government accusing India of backing the separatist movement—claims that New Delhi has consistently denied.

The attacks and subsequent military operation were widely condemned by China, France, Turkey, the US Embassy, and the UN Security Council. The violence highlights the persistent insurgency in Pakistan's largest but least developed province, where separatist groups have waged a decades-long campaign for independence, citing exploitation of natural resources and political marginalization by the central government.

### 6. Costa Rica Elects First Female President Since 2010 in First-Round Victory
*Feb 1*

> Laura Fernández Delgado of the ruling Sovereign People's Party won Costa Rica's presidential election with 48.30% of the vote, exceeding the 40% threshold required to avoid a runoff and becoming the Central American nation's second female president after Laura Chinchilla (2010-2014).

The February 1 elections saw Fernández defeat Álvaro Ramos Chaves of the National Liberation Party and 18 other candidates in a contest that centered on security, economic growth, and the controversial legacy of outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves. Her party also secured a commanding majority in the Legislative Assembly with 31 of 57 seats, against the PLN's 17, giving her government significant power to implement its agenda.

Fernández will be sworn in on May 8, 2026, continuing the aggressive reorienting of Costa Rican politics started by her political sponsor President Chaves. Her victory reflects voter support for the PPSO's conservative populist platform, which emphasizes law enforcement, economic development, and a nationalist approach to foreign policy—a departure from Costa Rica's traditional moderate centrism.

The election took place amid heightened political tensions in Central America, with neighboring countries experiencing democratic backsliding and increased Chinese influence in the region. How Fernández balances relations between Washington and Beijing while managing domestic economic challenges will define her presidency and Costa Rica's role in a strategically contested region.

### 7. Record Snowstorm Kills 45 in Japan, Self-Defense Forces Deploy for First Time in 21 Years
*Feb 3*

> Japan deployed Self-Defense Forces to Aomori Prefecture for the first time in 21 years as record-breaking snowfall killed at least 45 people and injured over 500 since January 20, with many victims suffering fatal falls while attempting to clear snow from roofs or heart attacks from extreme physical exertion.

The death toll varies across reports, with Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirming at least 30 deaths and 324 injuries as of early February, while more recent tallies exceed 45 fatalities and 500 injuries. Niigata Prefecture saw the highest death toll with 12 fatalities, followed by six deaths in Akita Prefecture and four in Aomori Prefecture, with most occurring when people attempted to remove accumulated snow from around their homes.

Many victims suffered sudden heart attacks due to extreme physical exhaustion during snow removal, while others died after slipping from building roofs or being buried by snow that slid from high places. The severity of the storm prompted the unprecedented military deployment to assist with snow removal and emergency operations in communities cut off by drifts exceeding three meters in some mountain valleys.

The snowfall represents one of the deadliest winter weather events in modern Japanese history, highlighting the vulnerability of rural and mountain communities to extreme weather despite Japan's advanced infrastructure and disaster preparedness systems. Climate scientists note that warming atmospheric patterns can paradoxically increase heavy snowfall events in some regions through enhanced moisture transport.

### 8. Washington Post Lays Off One-Third of Newsroom, Eliminates Sports and Foreign Bureaus
*Feb 4*

> The Washington Post laid off nearly 300 of its roughly 800 journalists—one-third of the newsroom—eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus, and books coverage in the most extensive cuts at the storied newspaper in years as owner Jeff Bezos restructures the organization amid sustained financial losses.

Executive Editor Matt Murray announced the layoffs during a Zoom call with employees, stating that the changes are necessary after years of financial challenges. Murray noted that the media environment has evolved greatly, with search traffic that once helped the paper "thrive" now in decline due to the growth of artificial intelligence—organic search traffic has fallen by nearly half in the last three years alone.

The wide-ranging job losses primarily affected sports, books, and podcast units, with foreign desks also heavily impacted, along with cuts to business and national teams. The Washington Post Guild stated that the outlet's workforce had shrunk by 400 people in the past three years, representing a wholesale transformation of one of America's most influential news organizations.

The layoffs mark the culmination of a difficult period for the Post that has included leadership turnover, controversial editorial decisions, and subscriber losses following the newspaper's decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. The cuts reflect broader challenges facing legacy media as digital advertising revenues decline, subscription growth stagnates, and AI-powered search threatens to disintermediate news organizations from their audiences.

### 9. Myanmar Junta Creates Union Consultative Council to Maintain Military Control After Elections
*Feb 3*

> Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing signed the Union Consultative Council Law, creating a powerful new body that will provide "guidance and coordination" on security, foreign relations, and legislative matters—a mechanism analysts say allows him to retain decisive authority even if he does not directly hold the presidency.

The Union Consultative Council was formally proposed on February 3 after the conclusion of Myanmar's 2025-26 general election, which saw the military-backed party declared the winner in voting that ASEAN and international observers refused to recognize as legitimate. Under the new legislation, the council is formed by the president and must include a minimum of five members, including a chairperson and secretary.

Critics point out that the law's provisions effectively place the council above the president in influence but below the president in formal authority, creating a position—that of council chief—that could allow Min Aung Hlaing to consolidate power around himself even in a nominal civilian government. The structure mirrors arrangements used by military regimes to maintain control while creating a facade of democratic governance.

The new consultative council law is widely interpreted as a pre-emptive move to ensure military dominance as Myanmar remains mired in civil war nearly five years after the February 2021 coup. Resistance forces control significant territory across the country, the economy has collapsed, and international isolation has deepened—yet the junta shows no signs of relinquishing power or engaging in meaningful political dialogue.

### 10. Storm Leonardo Kills Two, Forces 11,000 Evacuations Across Spain and Portugal
*Feb 5*

> Storm Leonardo battered the Iberian Peninsula with more than 40 centimeters of rain in 24 hours, killing at least two people—one in Portugal and one in Spain—and forcing more than 11,000 residents to evacuate their homes as emergency services dealt with over 3,300 incidents including flooding, falling trees, and landslides.

A man in his 60s was killed after being swept away by floodwaters while attempting to drive across a flooded area in southeastern Portugal. In southern Spain's Malaga province, a girl remains missing after being dragged away by the Turvilla River in Sayalonga while trying to rescue her dog. Emergency responders continue search operations despite dangerous conditions and receding floodwaters complicating recovery efforts.

The storm brought added hardship for Portugal, which was still reeling from Storm Kristin the previous week, which killed at least five people, injured hundreds, and cut off tens of thousands from the power grid. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro estimated damage from the consecutive storms exceeded four billion euros ($4.7 billion), putting enormous strain on emergency services and disaster relief budgets.

Portugal extended its state of emergency amid the destruction brought by Storm Leonardo, with meteorologists warning that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events. The back-to-back storms overwhelmed drainage systems, triggered devastating mudslides, and demonstrated the vulnerability of Mediterranean infrastructure to intensifying Atlantic storm systems.

### 11. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Seizes Two Oil Tankers in Persian Gulf Over Fuel Smuggling
*Feb 5*

> Iran's Revolutionary Guard Navy seized two foreign oil tankers carrying approximately 1 million liters of fuel near Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf, detaining 15 crew members on fuel smuggling charges just one day before scheduled high-level nuclear talks with the United States in Muscat, Oman.

The tankers were carrying about 6,300 barrels of fuel including diesel and were transferred to Bushehr after being seized on Thursday. Iranian authorities did not provide the nationality of the tankers or specify what flags they were flying, nor did they disclose the nationalities of the 15 crew members taken into custody by judicial bodies for investigation.

The seizure comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington following Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests and the Trump administration's deployment of significant military forces to the region. Iran occasionally seizes oil-carrying vessels in the Persian Gulf over smuggling charges, though the timing—just before nuclear negotiations—appeared designed to demonstrate Iran's control over the strategic waterway.

The incident highlights the fragility of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate US-Iran tensions, with both sides engaging in shows of force even as they pursue negotiations. The Strait of Hormuz and surrounding waters remain one of the world's most critical energy chokepoints, with roughly one-fifth of global oil supply transiting the narrow passage, making any disruption a matter of international economic concern.

### 12. Nigerian Forces Kill Senior Boko Haram Commander in Sambisa Forest Raid
*Feb 1*

> Nigeria's military announced the death of Abu Khalid, described as Boko Haram's deputy leader in the Sambisa Forest, along with ten other militants during a Saturday night raid in the Kodunga area of Borno State, recovering weapons, food items, and medical supplies from the extremist group.

Army spokesman Sani Uba identified Abu Khalid as a key figure within "the terrorist hierarchy, coordinating operations and logistics in the Sambisa axis." The operation targeted a Boko Haram command post that had been used to plan attacks across northeastern Nigeria, where the Islamic extremist group has waged an insurgency since 2009 that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions.

The raid represents part of Nigeria's ongoing counterterrorism efforts in the Lake Chad Basin region, where Boko Haram and its Islamic State-affiliated splinter group ISWAP continue to mount attacks despite years of military pressure. The Sambisa Forest has served as a primary stronghold for the militants, providing dense vegetation cover and proximity to civilian populations that complicate military operations.

While Nigerian authorities have announced the deaths of senior Boko Haram commanders numerous times over the years, the group has demonstrated resilience through decentralized leadership and continued ability to recruit from marginalized communities. The killing of Abu Khalid, if confirmed, would represent a tactical victory but is unlikely to fundamentally alter the conflict dynamics without broader efforts to address the poverty, governance failures, and ethnic tensions that fuel the insurgency.

### 13. Sudan Forces Break Two-Year Siege of Kadugli, Advance in South Kordofan
*Feb 3*

> The Sudanese Armed Forces announced they opened a road into Kadugli, breaking through an over two-year siege and achieving their second major advance in South Kordofan in as many weeks, as the brutal civil war between SAF and the Rapid Support Forces enters its third year with no diplomatic resolution in sight.

Conflict continues to escalate across multiple frontlines as both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces seek to consolidate territorial control through ground operations, artillery shelling, heavy drone strikes, and aerial bombardments. The Kordofan region has emerged as a key epicenter of hostilities, while fighting persists in North Darfur and Sennar states.

On January 11, the SAF announced the official return of national institutions to the capital, Khartoum, after recapturing the city in March 2025 from RSF forces that had seized control in April 2023 when the conflict erupted. The government had relocated to Port Sudan following the outbreak of the war that has devastated Africa's third-largest nation.

The humanitarian crisis continues to worsen, with an estimated 33.7 million people—around two-thirds of Sudan's population—expected to need humanitarian assistance in 2026. More than 20 million require health assistance, while 21 million face acute food insecurity. Sudan represents the world's largest displacement crisis, with 13.6 million people uprooted—9.3 million internally displaced and 4.3 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Overcrowded conditions and disrupted services have fueled outbreaks of cholera, malaria, dengue, and measles across much of the country.

### 14. Trump Cuts India Tariffs to 18% After Modi Pledges to Halt Russian Oil Purchases
*Feb 2*

> President Trump announced he would slash US tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% and remove a separate 25% Russia-related duty after Prime Minister Modi pledged to stop buying Russian oil and committed to purchasing more than $500 billion worth of American energy, technology, agricultural, and other products.

The trade deal ended months of escalating tensions between the two countries, with the administration also rescinding punitive tariffs imposed over India's purchases of Russian oil that had stacked on top of reciprocal tariff rates. Indian markets surged on the announcement, with the Nifty 50 jumping nearly 5% and the rupee strengthening to 90.40—its best day since November 2022—as trade war fears eased dramatically.

However, Prime Minister Modi notably welcomed the reduced tariffs in a post on social media but did not mention cutting purchases of Russian oil, raising questions about the specifics of the agreement. Nevertheless, India has begun slowing oil purchases from Russia, with January imports around 1.2 million barrels per day and projections showing declines to about 1 million bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March.

Analysts cautioned that legally binding text has yet to materialize, and implementation details remain unclear. The 18% US tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors in the battle for American market access, but whether the deal can withstand political scrutiny in both countries—particularly regarding the Russian oil commitment and agricultural tariff eliminations—will determine its longevity and economic impact.

### 15. European Central Bank Holds Rates at 2% for Fifth Consecutive Meeting Amid Uncertain Outlook
*Feb 5*

> The European Central Bank maintained its key policy rate at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, with policymakers emphasizing that inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move despite eurozone inflation cooling to 1.7% in January—below the ECB's 2% target.

The decision comes amid heightened economic uncertainty, with ECB officials monitoring the euro's recent appreciation and its potential disinflationary effects on the economy. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll predicted the ECB would leave rates unchanged for the remainder of 2026, reflecting expectations that inflation will remain contained even as growth remains subdued.

The ECB's cautious stance contrasts with more aggressive rate-cutting cycles in some other major economies but aligns with the Bank of England, which also held rates at 3.75% in February by a narrow 5-4 vote. The close vote reflects divisions on the committee about when to begin cutting rates, with some policymakers concerned about persistent services inflation while others worry about weak economic growth across the eurozone.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve held its policy rate at 3.5-3.75% in late January, with Chairman Powell emphasizing that economic activity remains solid and the balance of risks to the Fed's dual mandate is improving. The divergent monetary policy paths across major central banks reflect different inflation dynamics, labor market conditions, and growth trajectories as the global economy navigates the post-pandemic adjustment period.

## Financial News (Top 15)

### 1. Alphabet Projects $185 Billion AI Capex for 2026, Doubling Annual Investment
*Feb 4*

> Google's parent company reported record fourth-quarter earnings while announcing capital expenditure plans of $175-185 billion for 2026—more than double its $91.4 billion spend in 2025—marking the largest capital expenditure commitment ever announced by a technology company as CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the AI infrastructure investment is keeping him awake at night.

Alphabet beat Wall Street expectations with Q4 2025 earnings per share of $2.82 versus $2.63 estimated and revenue of $113.83 billion versus $111.43 billion expected. Annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time, with net income growing 15% to $132.2 billion. Google Cloud revenues surged 48% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, driven by enterprise AI adoption and infrastructure services.

The company's Gemini AI app reached more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million in the previous quarter. Alphabet achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency gains, and improved utilization. Approximately 60% of Q4 capex was invested in servers, with 40% allocated to data centers and networking equipment.

Despite strong operational performance, shares traded relatively flat as investors weighed the enormous spending commitment against uncertain returns on AI infrastructure. The guidance implies Alphabet is betting hundreds of billions of dollars that AI will transform internet services, cloud computing, and advertising—a wager that could reshape the technology industry but carries significant execution risk if demand fails to materialize or competition erodes margins.

### 2. Meta Surges 10% After Beating Expectations, Announces $115-135 Billion AI Spending Plan
*Feb 4*

> Meta Platforms reported Q4 2025 earnings per share of $8.88—beating forecasts by 8.42%—and revenue of $59.9 billion representing 24% year-over-year growth, while announcing plans to spend $115-135 billion in capital expenditures for 2026 to build AI infrastructure, sending shares surging 10% in extended trading.

Meta's advertising business generated $58.1 billion for the quarter, making up nearly 97% of total revenue, demonstrating continued dominance in digital advertising despite competition from TikTok and other platforms. Operating income reached $24.7 billion with a 41% margin, while net income hit $22.8 billion, reflecting the company's ability to monetize its massive user base across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.

For Q1 2026, Meta projected revenue between $53.5-56.5 billion, with full-year expenses estimated at $162-169 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized AI's transformative potential, noting that the company is planning significant investments in AI infrastructure and talent acquisition despite potential supply chain constraints limiting GPU availability from Nvidia and other chip manufacturers.

The results and guidance contrast sharply with broader tech sector volatility, positioning Meta as a winner in the AI infrastructure race as it builds capacity for both internal AI products and potential future monetization through AI-powered advertising, content recommendation, and business tools. The company's cash generation provides flexibility to invest aggressively while maintaining shareholder returns through its ongoing buyback program.

### 3. Microsoft Stock Plunges 10% on Azure Growth Slowdown Despite Record Capital Spending
*Feb 4*

> Microsoft shares suffered their biggest single-day decline since 2020, falling 10% after reporting that Azure cloud growth slowed from 40% in Q1 to 39% in Q2, disappointing investors despite the company announcing record capital expenditures of $37.5 billion for the quarter—66% higher than the prior year.

The decline extended through the following trading days, with shares falling an additional 3.5% as analysts digested implications of slowing cloud growth amid surging AI infrastructure investment. Stifel downgraded the stock from buy to hold on February 5, warning that consensus expectations for 2027 "are too optimistic" given the gap between capex spending and revenue acceleration.

Azure growth is projected to decelerate further to 37-38% in fiscal Q3, forming a concerning trend for investors who had expected AI services to accelerate cloud revenue growth. CFO Amy Hood noted that about two-thirds of the $37.5 billion quarterly capex was spent on GPUs and CPUs to keep up with AI demand, raising questions about return on investment as infrastructure spending outpaces revenue growth.

The stock decline reflects growing investor skepticism about whether massive AI spending by hyperscale cloud providers will generate adequate returns, or if the industry is building excess capacity that could lead to price competition and margin compression. Microsoft's struggle to translate record AI investment into accelerating cloud growth has become a cautionary tale as the sector grapples with what some analysts call an "AI infrastructure wall."

### 4. Amazon Plummets 8% on $200 Billion AI Spending Forecast Despite Strong AWS Growth
*Feb 4*

> Amazon shares tumbled 8% after the e-commerce and cloud giant reported Q4 earnings of $1.95 per share—narrowly missing the $1.97 consensus—and guided to capital expenditures potentially reaching $200 billion in 2026, more than double its 2025 spending, to build AI infrastructure for Amazon Web Services.

Despite the stock decline, AWS revenue grew robustly, maintaining its position as the market-leading cloud platform ahead of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The division continues to be Amazon's profit engine, generating operating margins significantly higher than the company's retail business, but the massive capex commitment raises questions about how long the AI spending surge can continue without more visible revenue acceleration.

The $200 billion guidance represents one of the largest capital investment programs in corporate history, rivaling or exceeding commitments from Alphabet and Meta as tech giants race to build the infrastructure necessary for training and deploying next-generation AI models. Approximately 60-70% of the spending will go toward securing GPU inventory from Nvidia, AMD, and potentially custom silicon from Amazon's own chip design teams.

Analysts questioned whether customer demand for AI services justifies the enormous infrastructure buildout, or whether hyperscalers are engaging in a prisoner's dilemma where none can afford to fall behind in capacity even if overall industry returns remain uncertain. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky defended the spending as necessary to meet "significant cloud customer demand" but acknowledged that near-term margin pressure is inevitable.

### 5. S&P 500 Earnings Growth Hits 13% in Q4 2025, Tenth Consecutive Quarter of Expansion
*Feb 6*

> Corporate America reported blended earnings growth of 13.0% for the fourth quarter of 2025, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of annual earnings expansion and the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth, as 76% of companies reporting beat analyst expectations despite macroeconomic headwinds.

With 59% of S&P 500 companies having reported Q4 results, companies are delivering earnings that are 7.6% above estimates in aggregate, demonstrating continued resilience in corporate profitability. Ten sectors are reporting year-over-year revenue growth, led by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Health Care sectors, with technology sector earnings exploding 25% year-over-year.

Wall Street analysts are projecting earnings growth rates of 11.3% for Q1 2026 and 14.9% for Q2 2026, with full calendar year 2026 expected to deliver 14.1% earnings expansion. The optimistic forecasts reflect expectations that AI-driven productivity gains, moderating inflation, and potential interest rate cuts will support profit margins even as revenue growth faces tougher comparisons.

However, the earnings strength masks significant divergence between AI beneficiaries and the broader market. Technology giants investing heavily in AI infrastructure are reporting explosive revenue and profit growth, while traditional cyclical sectors face margin pressure from tariffs, wage inflation, and slowing global demand. The concentration of earnings growth in a handful of mega-cap stocks raises questions about the sustainability of market valuations if AI monetization disappoints.

### 6. Gold Surges Past $5,500 to Record High as Safe-Haven Demand and Central Bank Buying Intensify
*Feb 6*

> Gold reached a new all-time high of $5,555 per ounce, marking a 100% gain over the last twelve months, as escalating geopolitical uncertainty, Federal Reserve independence concerns, and massive central bank purchases drive unprecedented safe-haven demand for the precious metal.

Spot gold increased to $5,501.18 per ounce, with February futures contracts exceeding $5,568 per unit. The rally reflects a fundamental repricing of gold as investors no longer view current prices as "imminent crisis" levels but rather as appropriate for "a world of persistent instability, heavy debt burdens and eroding monetary trust," according to market strategists.

Global gold ETFs witnessed their strongest year of inflows on record in 2025, with annual inflows surging to $89 billion and global gold ETF assets doubling to $559 billion. Central bank purchases remained robust as nations diversify reserves away from dollar-denominated assets amid concerns about US fiscal sustainability and the weaponization of the dollar in geopolitical disputes.

A weakening US dollar has provided additional tailwind, making dollar-priced assets like gold more affordable for holders of other currencies. Additionally, a Trump administration criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has elevated safe-haven demand due to implications for central bank independence. Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale forecast gold reaching $6,000 per ounce by year-end as structural drivers remain intact.

### 7. Emerging Markets Suffer Worst Week Since November as Global Risk Appetite Collapses
*Feb 6*

> Emerging market stocks fell 1.4%—their steepest weekly drop since mid-December—as a global flight to safety drove investors out of developing-nation equities from record highs, with volatility spanning commodities and technology shares unsettling portfolio managers worldwide.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell as much as 1.5% on Friday before paring losses, while a similar measure tracking currencies showed mixed performance. Both gauges were poised for their steepest weekly drop since November, pulling a key index down from record highs reached in January as risk-off sentiment gripped global markets.

The selloff reflects multiple converging pressures: geopolitical tensions including US-Iran standoffs and the expiration of New START, uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy outlook, concerns about lofty technology valuations following massive AI capex announcements, and fears that tariff policies could disrupt global trade flows that many emerging economies depend upon.

Developing-nation central banks face a challenging environment as they balance domestic growth concerns against the need to defend currencies and control inflation. Countries with high dollar-denominated debt loads are particularly vulnerable if the risk-off sentiment persists, potentially forcing interest rate hikes that could trigger recessions in economies already struggling with weak external demand and capital outflow pressures.

### 8. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings, Guides to $80-83 Billion Revenue on Weight Loss Drug Boom
*Feb 4*

> Eli Lilly reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion or $7.39 per share, crushing Wall Street expectations, as blockbuster demand for weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro drives unprecedented revenue growth in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 drug category.

The pharmaceutical giant guided to 2026 revenue between $80-83 billion, dramatically exceeding analyst expectations of $77.62 billion, with adjusted earnings projected between $33.50-35 per share compared to consensus estimates of $33.23. The guidance implies continued market share gains against competitor Novo Nordisk, which has faced supply constraints limiting its ability to meet surging demand.

Production capacity investments are paying off, allowing Lilly to meet demand while Novo Nordisk struggles with shortages. The company's success reflects broader transformation in the pharmaceutical industry as GLP-1 drugs emerge as potentially the largest drug class in history, with applications expanding beyond obesity and diabetes into cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other conditions.

Clinical trials exploring new indications could expand the total addressable market well beyond current analyst models, potentially justifying Lilly's premium valuation despite shares trading at historically elevated price-to-earnings multiples. The company's execution in ramping production capacity faster than competitors has established a structural advantage that could persist for years as the global obesity epidemic drives sustained demand growth.

### 9. Chipotle Stock Sinks 11% on Fourth Consecutive Quarter of Traffic Declines
*Feb 3*

> Chipotle Mexican Grill shares fell as much as 11% in extended trading after reporting a fourth consecutive quarter of falling customer traffic and projecting flat same-store sales growth for 2026, signaling that the burrito chain's woes are not expected to disappear quickly.

The company posted adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share for Q4, slightly above the $0.24 consensus estimate, with revenue of $2.98 billion compared to expectations of $2.96 billion. However, traffic to Chipotle restaurants fell 3.2% and comparable restaurant sales declined 1.7%—the first annual same-store sales drop since 2016, alarming investors accustomed to consistent growth.

Executives noted pullback in spending from consumers of all income cohorts, although low-income diners have made the most significant shift in behavior. The 2026 outlook disappointed Wall Street as the company projected flat sales while analysts had forecast 1.8% growth, suggesting management sees limited near-term improvement in consumer spending patterns.

The traffic declines raise questions about whether Chipotle's premium pricing strategy has reached its limits, or whether broader economic pressures are forcing consumers to cut back on fast-casual dining. The company faces the dual challenge of maintaining value perception while protecting margins in an inflationary environment where ingredient costs, labor expenses, and occupancy charges continue to rise.

### 10. Snowflake and OpenAI Announce $200 Million Partnership for Enterprise AI Integration
*Feb 2*

> Snowflake and OpenAI entered a multi-year, $200 million partnership that brings OpenAI frontier intelligence directly into Snowflake's data cloud, enabling the company's 12,600 enterprise customers to build AI applications and agents using their proprietary data without moving information outside Snowflake's governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models like GPT-5.2 will be available natively within Snowflake's AI Data Cloud across all three major cloud providers, allowing organizations to build custom applications and agents grounded in their enterprise data. Snowflake customers can use the models with tools like Snowflake Cortex AI to develop intelligent assistants, automated analytics, and AI-driven decision support tied directly to enterprise datasets.

The partnership is significant because it represents a direct, first-party integration of OpenAI's frontier models into Snowflake's platform rather than being mediated through a cloud provider like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud. This establishes deep technical integration that could provide performance and governance advantages over alternative architectures.

Analysts view the deal as strategic positioning in the enterprise AI race, where the battle is shifting from model development to production deployment at scale. Snowflake's emphasis on data governance and security—combined with OpenAI's leading language models—addresses enterprise concerns about deploying AI while maintaining control over proprietary information, intellectual property, and customer data.

### 11. Producer Price Inflation Jumps 0.5% as Businesses Begin Passing Tariff Costs to Consumers
*Feb 2*

> The Producer Price Index increased 0.5% in December—more than double the forecast of 0.2%—driven by a 0.7% surge in service prices, as businesses signal they are beginning to pass tariff costs down the supply chain after absorbing the majority of duties in 2025.

Core goods PPI rose 0.4% in December, pointing to continued pass-through of tariffs into wholesale prices. JPMorgan estimates businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs in 2025, but that proportion could flip to just 20% in 2026 as inventory stockpiles run out and price increases become unavoidable, setting the stage for renewed consumer inflation pressures.

The jump in wholesale prices fits into a wider trend of "deglobalization inflation," where tariffs and supply chain domestication are raising the floor for prices across goods and services. With businesses passing more tariff costs to consumers, forecasters project US inflation rising to 2.7% in 2026 from current levels, complicating the Federal Reserve's efforts to return inflation to its 2% target.

Service sector price increases of 0.7%—the largest gain since July—suggest that inflation pressures are broadening beyond goods affected by tariffs. Wage growth, commercial real estate costs, and business services expenses are all contributing to wholesale price gains that will eventually flow through to consumer prices in industries from healthcare to hospitality.

### 12. European Central Bank and Bank of England Hold Rates as Inflation Cools Below Targets
*Feb 5*

> The European Central Bank maintained its key policy rate at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting while the Bank of England held rates at 3.75% by a narrow 5-4 vote, as both institutions navigate slowing growth and below-target inflation amid uncertainty about economic trajectory and the impact of potential US tariffs.

Eurozone inflation cooled to 1.7% in January—below the ECB's 2% target—yet policymakers emphasized that inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant immediate rate cuts. Concerns about the euro's appreciation led some policymakers to monitor its potential disinflationary effects, while uncertainty about US trade policy creates additional complexity for monetary policy decisions.

Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to leave rates unchanged for the remainder of 2026, reflecting views that inflation will remain contained even as economic growth disappoints. The Bank of England's 5-4 vote reflects deeper divisions, with some members concerned about persistent services inflation while others worry about weak growth across major European economies.

The cautious approach from both central banks contrasts with expectations earlier in 2025 that aggressive rate cutting would be necessary to support growth. Resilient services inflation, tight labor markets, and uncertainty about fiscal policy in major economies have convinced policymakers to maintain restrictive policy despite below-target headline inflation and sluggish economic performance.

### 13. Oil Prices Hold Near $63 as Iran Tensions Create Risk Premium Amid Oversupply Concerns
*Feb 6*

> West Texas Intermediate crude settled above $63 a barrel after a volatile week that saw prices whipsaw on US-Iran tensions, upcoming nuclear talks, and competing concerns about global oversupply as production surges from non-OPEC+ countries outpace demand growth projections.

Oil markets rallied earlier in the week on geopolitical risk premium following US military deployments to the Gulf and threats of strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but gave back gains as diplomatic talks scheduled in Muscat reduced immediate conflict probability. Iran's seizure of two oil tankers added modest upward pressure but failed to sustain momentum amid fundamental concerns about supply-demand balance.

OPEC+ extended production cuts through Q1 2026, attempting to support prices as surging output from Brazil, Argentina, Guyana, and US shale producers threatens to create oversupply conditions. Latin America's three emerging oil powers are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing Venezuela's recovery despite sanctions relief.

Energy analysts project crude prices will remain range-bound in the $60-70 range through mid-2026 barring major geopolitical shocks, with the balance between growing non-OPEC supply and uncertain global demand creating a cap on price appreciation. Chinese economic weakness, electric vehicle adoption acceleration, and efficiency gains in transportation continue to moderate long-term demand forecasts.

### 14. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.11%, Lowest Level in Three Years, Spurring Housing Activity
*Feb 5*

> The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.11%—the lowest level since late 2022—driving a surge in purchase applications and refinance activity as the spring home-buying season approaches, with some lenders offering rates below 6% for well-qualified borrowers.

Freddie Mac reported the 15-year fixed mortgage averaged 5.50%, while Morgan Stanley projects rates could decline to 5.75% later in 2026 if inflation continues moderating and the Federal Reserve signals openness to additional rate cuts. The decline creates opportunities for both first-time buyers entering the market and existing homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments.

Purchase and refinance applications have jumped year-over-year as lower rates improve affordability despite home prices remaining elevated in many markets. A surprising share of homeowners still carry mortgage rates above 5%, creating significant refinance demand as rates decline toward 6%. Housing industry experts note that activity "is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season" after two years of rate-driven headwinds.

However, affordability challenges persist in major metropolitan areas where inventory shortages and elevated prices offset the benefit of lower rates. The combination of pent-up buyer demand, falling rates, and limited housing stock could produce highly competitive spring markets with bidding wars returning in desirable locations, potentially preventing the price cooling that would make homeownership accessible to middle-income families.

### 15. US Manufacturing Expands for First Time in 12 Months as New Orders and Production Surge
*Feb 2*

> The ISM Manufacturing Index showed factory activity expanding in January for the first time in a year, with surges in new orders and production signaling potential economic resilience and ending the longest manufacturing contraction streak since the 2008 financial crisis.

The expansion reflects improved business confidence, easing supply chain pressures, and stabilizing demand conditions after months of inventory reduction and cautious ordering patterns. Transport stocks hit new all-time highs with the Dow Jones Transportation Average rising 2%, led by United Airlines, Old Dominion, and Delta Air Lines as investors positioned for strengthening economic activity.

Goldman Sachs projects the US will substantially outperform global growth forecasts—estimating 2.6% GDP growth versus 2.0% consensus—due to reduced tariff drag, potential tax cuts, and easier financial conditions. The manufacturing rebound reinforces the bullish thesis that the economy can achieve a soft landing despite 18 months of restrictive Federal Reserve policy.

However, the sustainability of the manufacturing recovery remains uncertain given ongoing tariff threats, elevated interest rates relative to historical norms, and slowing global demand from major trading partners. Energy led January sector performance at 14.37%, followed by materials and consumer staples, while health care, information technology, and financials declined as investors rotated toward defensive positioning amid geopolitical turbulence.
