### 1. Pakistan Launches Strikes on Afghan Militant Camps, Taliban Reports Dozens Killed
*Feb 22*

> Pakistan carried out airstrikes on seven militant camps across the border in Afghanistan on Sunday, with its military conducting "intelligence-based, selective operations" against groups it blames for recent deadly attacks, while Afghanistan's Defense Ministry reported "dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children" were killed when strikes hit residential areas.

The strikes targeted the Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) and its affiliates, as well as a group associated with the Islamic State. Pakistan's State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry said nearly 70 militants were killed in the operations targeting terrorist hideouts along the Pakistan-Afghan border, while Afghanistan's Red Crescent Society reported 18 civilians dead and several wounded in eastern Nangarhar province.

The military action follows a devastating suicide bombing on February 6 that killed at least 31 worshippers and wounded 170 others during noon prayers at a mosque in Islamabad's Tarlai Kalan area. The Islamic State Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the Islamabad attack, which marked one of the deadliest terrorist incidents in Pakistan's capital in recent years.

Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Pakistan's Ambassador in Kabul to protest the strikes and vowed to "deliver an appropriate and calculated response." The escalation highlights deepening tensions between the two neighbors, with Islamabad accusing Kabul of harboring militants who stage cross-border attacks, while the Taliban government denies allowing armed groups to use Afghan territory for operations in Pakistan.

### 2. Former Prince Andrew Arrested on Epstein-Related Misconduct Charges in Historic Royal Detention
*Feb 19*

> Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, was arrested on his 66th birthday on suspicion of misconduct in public office following revelations that he allegedly shared confidential government documents with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while serving as UK trade envoy, marking the first arrest of a member of the royal family in centuries.

Thames Valley Police detained Andrew for 11 hours before releasing him "under investigation," meaning he has been neither charged nor exonerated. The arrest followed the release of emails by the U.S. Department of Justice showing Mountbatten-Windsor apparently sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, and sending Epstein a confidential brief on investment opportunities in Afghanistan during his 2010 tenure as trade envoy.

If charged with misconduct in public office, the offense carries a maximum possible sentence of life in prison in Britain. King Charles III expressed his "deepest concern" about the case and stressed that "the law must take its course," signaling that the monarchy would not interfere with the judicial process despite the unprecedented nature of prosecuting a former senior royal.

The UK government is weighing whether to remove the former prince from the line of succession amid the Epstein probe. Parliament could pass legislation stripping him of succession rights, though such a move would be historically extraordinary and require careful constitutional consideration given the precedent it would set for future cases involving royal family members.

### 3. South Korea Sentences Former President Yoon Suk Yeol to Life in Prison for Insurrection
*Feb 19*

> A South Korean court sentenced former President Yoon Suk Yeol to life in prison after finding him guilty of leading an insurrection during his short-lived imposition of martial law in December 2024, when armed soldiers descended on parliament by helicopter and attempted to storm the legislative chamber where lawmakers were gathered.

Presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon ruled that Yoon's intention in declaring martial law was clearly to paralyze the National Assembly for a significant period, and that dispatching armed soldiers to the parliament building and transporting them by helicopter constituted acts of insurrection. The prosecution had requested the death penalty, but the court imposed life imprisonment instead.

The December 3, 2024 martial law declaration lasted only hours before lawmakers voted to overturn it, but the attempted power grab triggered months of political turmoil culminating in Yoon's impeachment, arrest, and trial. Former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo received 23 years in prison, becoming the first Yoon administration official convicted of insurrection charges, while former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun was sentenced to 30 years.

Yoon, who can appeal the ruling, denied the insurrection charge and still faces six pending trials filed by special prosecutors, covering charges ranging from espionage and perjury to abuse of power and election law violations. At 65 years old and in declining health after months of detention, Yoon faces spending his remaining years in prison unless appellate courts overturn the verdict.

### 4. Over 1,000 Kenyans Recruited to Fight for Russia in Ukraine, Intelligence Report Reveals
*Feb 21*

> More than 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight on Russia's side in the Ukraine war according to a Kenyan intelligence report presented to lawmakers, five times more than authorities had previously estimated, with recruitment agencies colluding with rogue airport staff, immigration officials, and Russian Embassy personnel to facilitate the trafficking operation.

As of February 2026, 89 Kenyans were on the Ukrainian frontline, 39 hospitalized, 28 missing in action, 30 repatriated, one detained, and at least one death confirmed. The recruiters targeted former soldiers and police officers, as well as unemployed people, with promises of earning 350,000 shillings ($2,715) per month and bonuses up to 1.2 million shillings ($9,309).

Those enlisted initially left Kenya on tourist visas and travelled to Russia via Turkey or the United Arab Emirates. After Kenya tightened surveillance at Nairobi airport, the recruits started travelling via Uganda, South Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo. Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing'Oei has held high-level discussions with Ukraine's Ambassador regarding the safety and possible repatriation of Kenyans captured on the frontlines.

The Russian Embassy in Nairobi denied on Thursday that Moscow was involved in illegally recruiting Kenyans to fight in Ukraine, though it acknowledged that foreign citizens could voluntarily join its armed forces. The revelations have sparked domestic outrage in Kenya and raised questions about how hundreds of citizens were trafficked to a war zone despite government assurances of enhanced border security and vigilance against human trafficking networks.

### 5. China's Top General Zhang Youxia Arrested in Xi's Sweeping Military Purge
*Feb 8*

> Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission and China's most senior general, was arrested on corruption allegations in a stunning move that hollowed out the country's top military body and confirmed President Xi Jinping's far-reaching power over the People's Liberation Army.

Until recently, Zhang's abrupt sidelining was largely unexpected due to his long military tenure and perceived closeness with Xi. He served alongside Xi's father when the two were Communist fighters in the country's northwest, and the younger Zhang and Xi, now 75 and 72, are both "princelings"—children of revolutionary-era Communist Party leaders.

Zhang's arrest "increases the risk of a miscalculation" regarding Taiwan, said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London, as there are fewer generals who would challenge Xi's decisions. Xi has reached a "tipping point" in his battle to bring the PLA "under his absolute personal control," furthering his long-term goal of building a force "capable of conquering Taiwan and prevailing in a potential confrontation" with the U.S.

The purge represents the most significant anti-corruption campaign in the Chinese military since Xi came to power in 2012, with dozens of senior officers dismissed or investigated over the past year. Defense analysts warn that the extensive purges could temporarily weaken military readiness as new commanders establish authority and institutional knowledge is lost, though Xi appears willing to accept short-term disruption to ensure absolute loyalty in the officer corps.

### 6. Japan's Prime Minister Takaichi Wins Historic Supermajority, BOJ Faces Policy Dilemma
*Feb 8*

> Japan's first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, led the Liberal Democratic Party to a historic landslide on February 8, winning 316 of 465 seats in the House of Representatives—a 68% majority representing the largest single-party dominance in Japan's post-war democratic history, while Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda faces mounting pressure over interest rate policy.

The LDP won a historic landslide victory, regaining its majority and setting a new postwar record with 316 seats, giving the party a two-thirds supermajority in its own right. The election results came nearly four months into Takaichi's tenure, which began on October 21, 2025, and delivered her an overwhelming mandate to pursue controversial policies including constitutional reform.

Governor Kazuo Ueda is facing the most difficult choice of his career, as by the end of 2025, the Bank of Japan had pushed the policy rate to 0.75%, the highest level in 30 years. The market generally expects the BOJ to raise interest rates again to 1.0% or even higher by mid-2026, creating significant tension between Takaichi's massive fiscal expansion and the central bank's monetary tightening.

The government is engaging in massive fiscal expansion while the central bank tries to tighten—an operation of "stepping on both the gas and the brake" that will greatly exacerbate volatility in the yen exchange rate. Takaichi entered the election with a ¥21 trillion economic stimulus package as the core of her government's economic agenda, dubbed 'Sanaenomics', intended to combat rising prices but raising concerns about fiscal sustainability.

### 7. U.S. Pressures NATO to Reduce Kosovo and Iraq Missions in "Return to Factory Settings"
*Feb 19*

> The United States is putting pressure on NATO to reduce the KFOR mission in Kosovo and scale back operations in Iraq, according to NATO diplomats, as Washington signals it wants the alliance to focus on core Euro-Atlantic defense rather than "out-of-area activities," in what has become internally known as a "return to factory settings."

The USA has signaled that it wants to reduce KFOR forces in Kosovo, though discussions are still in a very early stage. These activities by Washington reflect the White House's aspiration to treat NATO as a strictly Euro-Atlantic defense pact, with the alliance being asked to reduce operations outside its core tasks of defense and deterrence in the North Atlantic region.

NATO has been leading a peace-support operation in Kosovo—the Kosovo Force (KFOR)—since June 1999 in support of wider international efforts to build peace and stability in the area. The NATO-led mission continues to contribute to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all people and communities living in Kosovo and freedom of movement, but the Trump administration views these stabilization operations as distracting from deterring Russia.

The U.S. request faces resistance within the alliance, with not all NATO members sharing this opinion and some diplomats stating that "giving up on the alliance's overseas initiatives is not the right approach." European allies worry that withdrawing from long-standing peacekeeping missions could create security vacuums that Russia, China, or other actors might exploit, undermining Western credibility in crisis regions.

### 8. U.S. Completes Withdrawal from Al-Asad Airbase, Iraq Announces End of Federal Territory Presence
*Jan 18-20*

> The United States completed its withdrawal from al-Asad air base in Iraq's Anbar Province in mid-January 2026, bringing to a close more than two decades of American military presence in western Iraq's federal territory, though roughly 300 advisors and security personnel remain at Harir Air Base in the Kurdistan Region to support counter-ISIS operations.

Iraq's government announced that US forces had completed a "full withdrawal" from military facilities within the country's federal territory, excluding the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region where US troops remain. The withdrawal was part of an agreement signed in late September for a phased departure by the end of 2026, with forces in Iraq proper relocated to Kurdistan by September 2025 and most remaining troops scheduled to leave Iraq altogether by September 2026.

A unit of roughly 300 advisors and security personnel will remain at Harir Air Base in Erbil province to support intelligence and surveillance efforts with U.S. forces in Syria conducting counter-ISIL operations. The withdrawal represents a significant milestone in U.S.-Iraq relations, though it's not a complete departure as American personnel remain in the Kurdistan region.

The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to reduce U.S. military commitments in the Middle East and refocus resources on great power competition with China, while Iraqi lawmakers from Shia political parties have long pushed for complete U.S. withdrawal. Security analysts warn that the drawdown could create opportunities for ISIS remnants to reconstitute, though Iraqi security forces maintain they are capable of managing residual terrorist threats independently.

### 9. Munich Security Conference Exposes Deep Divisions as Democrats Struggle to Define Alternative to Trump
*Feb 13-15*

> The 62nd Munich Security Conference exposed profound uncertainty about the future of U.S. foreign policy as Democratic presidential hopefuls descended on the event but found European leaders "see us as a wrecking ball" and largely ignoring them while assuming leaders like Donald Trump will define the future, according to California Governor Gavin Newsom.

Multiple potential 2028 presidential candidates attended, including Gavin Newsom, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Kelly, Gretchen Whitmer, and Senators Chris Murphy, Elissa Slotkin, and Ruben Gallego. Even as Democrats arrived to reassure allies that another United States still existed—one committed to alliances, multilateralism, and the liberal international order—their very presence underscored the fragility of that promise.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made headlines for a massive stumble when asked whether the U.S. should send troops to defend Taiwan from a possible invasion by China, appearing to stall for nearly 20 seconds before offering that the U.S. should try to avoid reaching a clash with China over Taiwan. The gaffe drew sharp criticism and raised questions about progressive Democrats' readiness to articulate coherent foreign policy alternatives.

European officials could not ignore the structural reality that US foreign policy now appeared contingent on domestic electoral outcomes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio represented the Trump administration and received praise from some attendees for articulating clear positions, while Democratic attendees struggled to gain traction with European leaders focused on navigating the current administration rather than potential future alternatives.

### 10. Hong Kong Tycoon Jimmy Lai Sentenced to 20 Years, China Summons Western Envoys Over Criticism
*Feb 9*

> Hong Kong activist and media entrepreneur Jimmy Lai was sentenced to 20 years in prison under the National Security Law on February 9, including charges of "collusion with foreign forces" and conspiring to publish "seditious" material, prompting China to summon the heads of UK, U.S., Australian and European Union missions on February 15 after their governments criticized the prosecution.

At 78 years old and in rapidly declining health, Lai, a British citizen and prisoner of conscience who has already endured over five years' imprisonment in solitary confinement, faces spending his final years in prison. The EU deplored the heavy sentence as a politically motivated prosecution that undermines Hong Kong's autonomy and judicial independence under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.

China's foreign ministry commissioner's office in Hong Kong said it expressed "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" and urged those governments to respect China's sovereignty and Hong Kong's rule of law, stop "irresponsible" remarks on national security cases and cease interfering in Hong Kong and China's internal affairs. The UK Foreign Secretary criticized the sentencing as evidence of Hong Kong's deteriorating freedoms under Chinese control.

The case represents one of the highest-profile prosecutions under the National Security Law imposed by Beijing in 2020, which has been used to dismantle Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and silence dissent. Western governments view Lai's imprisonment as emblematic of China's systematic erosion of Hong Kong's promised autonomy, while Beijing insists the law is necessary to restore stability after the 2019 pro-democracy protests.

### 11. Thailand's Conservative Bhumjaithai Party Wins Surprise Election Victory
*Feb 8*

> Thailand's conservative Bhumjaithai Party secured a stunning election victory on February 8, winning 193 seats in the House of Representatives and marking the first time this century that a party aligned with the country's royalist establishment has won at the ballot box, while voters also approved drafting a new constitution with roughly 19 million supporting the measure.

General elections saw Prime Minister Anutin Chittchawong's Bhumjaithai Party substantially outperform pre-election polls, defeating the People's Party (118 seats) and Pheu Thai (74 seats). The election was a rare victory for conservatism and nationalism in Thailand, with Bhumjaithai benefiting from nationalist sentiments after Thailand's recent clash with Cambodia over border disputes.

A referendum held concurrently asked whether the 2017 constitution should be replaced with a new one, with roughly 19 million Thais voting in favor of drafting a new constitution, while 10 million rejected the idea, and almost three million voted "no opinion." The referendum result gives Bhumjaithai a mandate to pursue constitutional reform that could strengthen executive power and traditional institutions.

The outcome has significant implications for Thailand's role in regional geopolitics, particularly regarding relations with China and the United States. The contest reflected deep political realignment, though Bhumjaithai's pro-establishment orientation likely means continued careful balancing between the major powers while maintaining Thailand's traditional foreign policy pragmatism.

### 12. Bangladesh Holds Post-Revolution Election Amid Islamist Challenge
*Feb 12*

> Bangladesh held parliamentary elections and a constitutional referendum on February 12, 2026, following the 2024 Monsoon Revolution and the fall of Sheikh Hasina, with the contest reflecting a deep political realignment as the BNP faced an increasingly competitive Islamist challenge led by Jamaat-e-Islami and its alliance with youth-based movements.

The election took place in a transformed political landscape after the revolution that toppled Hasina's government in 2024. The BNP remained favored but faced unexpected competition from Islamist parties that gained significant support among younger voters disillusioned with both traditional parties and seeking more radical change in governance and social policies.

The constitutional referendum on the post-revolution reform package known as the July Charter addressed fundamental questions about Bangladesh's political structure, including executive powers, judicial independence, and the role of religion in governance. The vote was watched closely by regional powers including India, China, and Pakistan, all of whom have strategic interests in Bangladesh's political direction.

International observers expressed concerns about isolated incidents of violence and intimidation but generally characterized the election as credible despite the challenging security environment. The results will shape Bangladesh's trajectory for years to come, particularly regarding economic policy, relations with neighboring India, and the balance between secular and religious influences in governance.

### 13. New START Nuclear Arms Treaty Expires, Ending Five Decades of U.S.-Russia Strategic Limits
*Feb 5*

> The New START treaty officially expired on February 5, 2026, marking the first time in more than half a century that no binding limits exist on U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned the world now faces unprecedented risk without legally binding constraints on the two largest nuclear powers.

Under its provisions, New START could not be extended beyond February 5, 2026. The treaty had limited deployed strategic nuclear warheads for each party to 1,550—down nearly two-thirds from the original START treaty—and restricted deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments to 800 for each nation.

"For the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals" of the two countries, according to Guterres. This represents the first time since the early 1970s that there will be no legally binding limits on US and Russian strategic nuclear forces without another agreement being under negotiation.

Trump has suggested that if New START expires, a "better" agreement could be negotiated and said that China should be included. After the expiration, the Trump administration stated that a new nuclear arms control treaty should include China, though Beijing has shown little interest in trilateral arms control negotiations given its significantly smaller nuclear arsenal compared to the U.S. and Russia.

### 14. Trump Administration Slashes Foreign Aid, USAID Elimination Linked to 600,000 Deaths
*Feb 2026*

> The Trump administration submitted a $9.4 billion rescission package to Congress targeting core foreign assistance accounts including global health programs, development aid, humanitarian response, and contributions to multilateral institutions, with Congress later approving rescissions allowing the president to cut around $7.9 billion in foreign assistance.

The Trump administration's decision to eliminate USAID resulted in 600,000 deaths by November 5, 2025, two-thirds of which were children, according to public health analyses. Almost exactly one year ago, USAID's dismantling began, and the State Department officially absorbed the agency in July 2025, fundamentally restructuring U.S. development assistance delivery.

The Trump administration later launched an $11 billion America First Global Health Strategy to fill the gap, intending to foster U.S. influence in developing nations while promoting self-reliance. Sharp cuts to foreign aid have hindered global efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation and other public health priorities, including funding reductions from both the U.S. and U.K.

The fiscal year 2026 budget request featured devastating cuts to foreign assistance spending, slashing global health and humanitarian assistance while repackaging development assistance in an "America First" fund. International development organizations warned that the restructuring and budget cuts undermine decades of progress on global health, food security, and poverty reduction, while creating opportunities for China to expand its influence through development financing.

### 15. Myanmar Military Junta Secures Landslide Victory in Sham Elections
*Dec 2025 - Jan 2026*

> Myanmar held three-phase elections beginning December 28, 2025, which produced a preordained outcome as the Union Solidarity and Development Party—the military's political party—won a landslide on abysmal voter turnout of 13.1 million votes, compared with 25.9 million votes cast in the 2020 general election that the junta nullified after seizing power.

Voting was held in three phases: Phase 1 (December 28, 2025), Phase 2 (January 11, 2026), and Phase 3 (January 25, 2026). The staged process allowed the junta to manage security concerns and suppress dissent while creating a facade of democratic legitimacy for the military-backed government that has ruled Myanmar since the February 2021 coup.

International observers and pro-democracy activists characterized the elections as a "sham" and "scam" designed to legitimize military rule rather than provide genuine democratic choice. The National Unity Government—the opposition coalition including deposed civilian leaders—called for a boycott and dismissed the results as fraudulent.

The dramatically reduced turnout reflects widespread rejection of the junta's political process, with many citizens boycotting the vote or unable to participate due to conflict and displacement. The international community, including the UN, EU, and ASEAN, largely refused to recognize the election's legitimacy, though some neighboring countries have maintained pragmatic engagement with Myanmar's military regime despite the democratic rollback.

## Financial News (Top 15)

### 1. Danaher Closes $9.9 Billion Acquisition of Masimo in Largest Medtech Deal in Five Years
*Feb 2026*

> Danaher completed its acquisition of medical technology company Masimo Corporation for $180.00 per share in cash, representing a total consideration of $9.9 billion—Danaher's largest deal in more than five years since the $21.4 billion purchase of Cytiva, as shares rallied 33% following initial reports of the transaction.

The deal values Masimo well above its market capitalization of nearly $7 billion prior to acquisition talks, with the $180 per share price representing a substantial premium. Masimo will become a standalone operating company within Danaher's Diagnostics segment alongside Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, Cepheid and Beckman Coulter Diagnostics.

The transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2026 and is subject to customary conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory clearances and Masimo shareholder approval. Masimo is known for its pulse oximetry technology and patient monitoring systems, which complement Danaher's existing diagnostics and life sciences portfolio.

The acquisition reflects continued consolidation in the medical technology sector as large companies seek to acquire innovative platforms with established revenue streams rather than investing in uncertain early-stage research and development. Healthcare analysts view the deal as strategically sound given Masimo's strong market position in critical care monitoring and recurring revenue from consumables, though some questioned whether Danaher overpaid given Masimo's recent operational challenges.

### 2. Blue Owl Capital Halts Quarterly Redemptions, Triggers Private Credit Concerns
*Feb 18*

> Blue Owl Capital Corporation II stopped offering quarterly redemption opportunities for its private, retail-facing debt fund on February 18, replacing it with a mandatory liquidation model funded by loan repayments and asset sales, while simultaneously executing a massive $1.4 billion sale of loan assets to fortify its balance sheet and appease restless shareholders.

The move sparked widespread concern about stress in the booming $1.7 trillion private credit market, with shares of Blue Owl falling roughly 6% and Apollo Global and Blackstone shares falling more than 5% following the announcement. Blue Owl stated that payouts would be about 30% of the fund's net asset value to all shareholders within 45 days under the new distribution plan—a much larger payout than would have been available under the quarterly tender system.

"This is a canary in the coal mine," Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. "The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst." The Blue Owl fund had traditionally allowed investors to exit up to 5% of their holdings quarterly, providing liquidity that differentiated private credit from traditional illiquid private equity investments.

The redemption freeze raises fundamental questions about liquidity management in private credit funds marketed to retail investors, who typically expect greater access to their capital than institutional investors in locked-up vehicles. Regulators and industry observers are closely monitoring whether Blue Owl's situation represents an isolated incident or signals broader stress in private credit markets as interest rates remain elevated and some borrowers face refinancing difficulties.

### 3. Norwegian Cruise Line Faces Activist Push as Elliott Builds 10%+ Stake
*Feb 2026*

> Activist investor Elliott Investment Management built a stake of more than 10% in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and plans to push for changes at the struggling cruise operator, making Elliott one of NCLH's largest shareholders and sending shares up 7.5% on reports of the investment.

Elliott, which manages more than $79 billion in assets and is known for high-profile activist campaigns, is expected to engage with Norwegian's management and board in an effort to address operational and financial underperformance. Elliott reportedly believes improvements in areas such as destination development, guest experience, and financial discipline could help narrow the performance gap with larger rivals Royal Caribbean and Carnival Corporation.

The timing is significant as it coincides with leadership changes within Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Following Harry Sommer's departure in February 2026, John Chidsey took over as CEO and Chairman of the board. As part of its engagement, Elliott has been privately working with Adam Goldstein, the former president and chief operating officer of Royal Caribbean, as a potential board nominee at Norwegian.

Cruise industry analysts view the activist involvement as potentially positive for Norwegian, which has lagged competitors in post-pandemic recovery and faces challenges including ship maintenance issues, itinerary optimization, and yield management. However, Elliott's campaigns sometimes create management distraction and tension between short-term financial engineering and long-term strategic investments.

### 4. Walmart Reports Strong Holiday Sales but Issues Cautious Outlook on Consumer Pressures
*Feb 19*

> Walmart reported that holiday-quarter sales rose nearly 6% with earnings per share of 74 cents adjusted versus 73 cents expected and revenue of $190.66 billion versus $190.43 billion expected, but the retailer offered cautious guidance for fiscal 2026 that fell short of Wall Street expectations, citing pressure on lower-income consumers.

Comparable sales jumped 4.6% for Walmart's U.S. business and 4% for Sam's Club in the fourth quarter, excluding fuel, while e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 27% compared with the year-ago period. The digital growth was fueled by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery of online orders, along with the retailer's third-party marketplace and advertising business.

For the full current fiscal year, Walmart said it expects net sales to increase by 3.5% to 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.75 to $2.85. That earnings outlook fell short of Wall Street's expectations of $2.96 per share, reflecting concerns about consumer spending patterns and margin pressure from wage inflation and supply chain costs.

Throughout late 2025 and into early 2026, the company reported that approximately 75% of its market share gains came from households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000. However, the company acknowledged "some pressure on the lowest income cohort," with spending among the highest earners compared to lower-income groups "had gapped out a little bit," highlighting the bifurcated consumer economy.

### 5. Big Tech AI Spending Approaches $700 Billion as Amazon Announces $200 Billion Capex Plan
*Feb 2026*

> Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are expected to spend nearly $700 billion combined in 2026 to fuel their AI build-outs, with Amazon leading the field by announcing a $200 billion capital expenditure plan—far exceeding consensus expectations of $147 billion and representing the largest single-year capex commitment by any technology company in history.

Alphabet expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion—more than double its 2025 spend and exceeding the forecasts of its hyperscaler peers. The vast majority of spending will go toward AI chips, servers, and data center infrastructure, with Alphabet noting that approximately 60% of Q4 investment went to servers and 40% to data centers and networking equipment.

Microsoft's capital expenses reached $37.5 billion in Q2 2026, up 66% and exceeding analyst estimates, with roughly two-thirds for short-lived assets like GPUs and CPUs. Microsoft's stock dropped over 6% in after-hours trading on concerns about capital expenditure levels despite strong earnings and growth in AI and cloud services.

The unprecedented spending levels reflect intense competition to build AI infrastructure and capture market share in generative AI applications, but also raise questions about return on investment. Corporate earnings showed performance divergence, with Microsoft shedding 7.7% on capital expenditure concerns while Meta rallied 8.8% after raising its 2026 sales projection, demonstrating that investors are differentiating between companies based on their ability to monetize AI investments.

### 6. LyondellBasell Faces Credit Downgrade Warning, Dividend Cut Concerns Mount
*Feb 20*

> LyondellBasell is facing a credit warning from S&P Global that has put the company's dividend reliability into the spotlight, with investors pricing in the risk of a dividend cut following the S&P "CreditWatch Negative" placement on February 18, 2026, sending shares tumbling as retail investors worried about potential payout reductions.

The chemicals company is facing significant challenges including overcapacity in Asian markets and high energy costs in Europe. Fiscal year 2025 was a "trough" year for LyondellBasell, with revenues declining to approximately $30.2 billion from $40+ billion levels in 2023, though much of this was due to planned divestitures and refinery closures.

While no actual dividend cut has been announced yet, retail investors are primarily concerned with the dividend, and any sign of a payout reduction would likely trigger a significant retail sell-off. As of February 2026, Wall Street is in a "wait and see" mode with a consensus "Hold/Neutral" rating on the stock.

LyondellBasell is attempting to pivot toward circular economy business models including chemical recycling and sustainable materials, but the transition requires significant capital investment at a time when traditional petrochemical margins are compressed. The company's situation illustrates broader challenges facing traditional chemical manufacturers as they navigate the energy transition, overcapacity in key markets, and the need to maintain shareholder returns while investing in transformation.

### 7. S&P 500 Companies Report 13.2% Q4 Earnings Growth, Tech Leads with 25% Expansion
*Feb 2026*

> For Q4 2025, 74% of S&P 500 companies reported positive earnings surprises and 73% reported positive revenue surprises, with a blended earnings growth rate of 13.2%—marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth and the tenth straight quarter of annual earnings expansion.

The blended revenue growth rate for Q4 2025 is 9.0%, which would mark the highest revenue growth rate since Q3 2022 (11.0%). Three sectors are reporting double-digit revenue growth: Information Technology, Communication Services, and Health Care, with the technology sector posting explosive 25% year-over-year earnings growth driven by AI infrastructure investments and strong cloud computing demand.

For Q1 2026 and Q2 2026, analysts are forecasting earnings growth rates of 11.3% and 14.9% respectively, with full year 2026 earnings growth projected at 14.1%. The forward 12-month P/E ratio is 21.5, above the 5-year average of 20.0 and the 10-year average of 18.8, raising questions about whether equity valuations adequately reflect economic and policy risks.

However, the earnings strength masks significant divergence between AI beneficiaries and the broader market. Technology giants investing heavily in AI infrastructure are reporting explosive revenue and profit growth, while traditional cyclical sectors face margin pressure from tariffs, wage inflation, and slowing global demand. The concentration of earnings growth in a handful of mega-cap stocks raises sustainability questions if AI monetization disappoints.

### 8. Bank of America Survey Shows Historic Shift Away from U.S. Equities
*Feb 2026*

> The February 2026 Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey revealed a pronounced rotation away from U.S. assets toward emerging markets and Europe, with emerging-market allocations rising to a net 49% overweight—the highest since February 2021—while investors are net 22% underweight U.S. equities.

The survey covered 190 institutional fund managers with $512 billion under management and depicted an exceptionally optimistic investor backdrop, with overall sentiment reaching its most bullish level since June 2021. U.S. equities fell by 20 percentage points from near-neutral in January, with most of that reduction reallocated to Eurozone and emerging-market equities.

Eurozone equities climbed to a net 35% overweight, while February also saw a rotation toward Energy, Materials and Staples, and away from U.S. equities, Tech and the U.S. dollar. The survey indicates a historic shift in institutional capital flows, with the largest rotation away from US equities toward emerging markets in five years.

The positioning shift reflects concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability, tariff impacts on profit margins, Federal Reserve policy uncertainty, and relative valuation as U.S. stocks trade at significant premiums to international markets. However, some strategists caution that such extreme positioning changes can sometimes signal contrarian opportunities if U.S. markets stabilize and outperform expectations.

### 9. Oil Prices Surge Above $70 on Iran Tensions Before Pulling Back
*Feb 19-20*

> Oil prices surged more than 4% to top $70 per barrel on February 19 after traders reacted to escalating U.S.-Iran tensions, with Brent crude reaching $71.47 and WTI hitting $66.29 before stabilizing as both contracts were set to notch roughly 5.3% weekly gains amid heightened geopolitical risk premiums.

Trump ramped up pressure on Iran, warning it to strike a deal on its nuclear program within 10 days or face "bad things," while both countries increased military activity near the Strait of Hormuz—one of the world's most important oil transit routes through which roughly a fifth of global oil flows. U.S. commercial crude inventories slipped by 9.0 million barrels last week, landing at 419.8 million barrels, adding support to prices.

The EIA noted that escalating tensions with Iran put upward pressure on prices, though they expect oil prices will decline in 2026 as global oil production exceeds demand, forecasting Brent will average $58 per barrel in 2026. The divergence between short-term geopolitical risk premiums and longer-term supply-demand fundamentals creates volatility that complicates energy policy and investment decisions.

Energy analysts project crude prices will remain range-bound in the $60-70 range through mid-2026 barring major geopolitical shocks, with the balance between growing non-OPEC supply and uncertain global demand creating a cap on price appreciation. Chinese economic weakness, electric vehicle adoption acceleration, and efficiency gains in transportation continue to moderate long-term demand forecasts.

### 10. Federal Reserve Holds Rates at 3.5%-3.75%, Minutes Reveal Division on Future Path
*Jan 28 / Feb 18*

> The Federal Reserve maintained its key interest rate in a range between 3.5% and 3.75% at its January 2026 meeting, putting a halt to three consecutive quarter-percentage-point reductions from late 2025, while minutes released February 18 revealed that some officials even considered the possibility of rate hikes if inflation persists.

The decision followed inflation data showing consumer and wholesale prices remain elevated, with current data showing a 4.3% unemployment rate and persistent wage growth complicating monetary policy decisions. The median FOMC projection forecasts an inflation rate of 2.4% by the end of 2026, down from 2.6% in September, but still above the Fed's 2% target.

Futures markets are pricing in at most two rate reductions in 2026 and none in 2027, reflecting expectations the Fed will wait until at least June before adjusting its benchmark rate again. The minutes showed divided Fed officials indicated that further interest rate cuts should be paused for now and could resume later in the year only if inflation cooperates.

Powell emphasized that economic activity remains solid and the balance of risks to the Fed's dual mandate is improving, though current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May and President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair adds uncertainty to the monetary policy outlook. While Warsh has recently called for lower interest rates, he is expected to maintain a data-dependent approach rather than pursuing aggressive easing.

### 11. Labor Market Stabilizes as Jobless Claims Fall to 206,000, Lowest Drop Since November
*Feb 19*

> Initial jobless claims fell to 206,000 for the week ending February 14, representing a decrease of 23,000 from the previous week—the most significant drop since November—adding to evidence of labor market stabilization despite some underlying concerns about economic conditions and corporate restructuring.

Continuing claims (insured unemployment) increased to 1,869,000 for the week ending February 7, rising by 17,000, and the insured unemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.2 percent. The data reflects a stable labor market with slow firing momentum offsetting soft hiring momentum, consistent with the Federal Reserve's view.

Claims are hovering within the 200,000 to 250,000 range considered healthy by economists, indicating the labor market remains relatively resilient despite some underlying concerns. For the week ending February 7, initial jobless claims of 227,000 signaled that while hiring has slowed in many sectors, mass layoffs have not materialized despite widespread concerns about AI-driven automation and corporate cost-cutting.

The labor market data suggests the economy is achieving a "soft landing" scenario where inflation moderates without triggering recession or mass unemployment. However, economists note that forward-looking indicators suggest hiring will remain subdued as companies exercise caution about headcount growth amid uncertainty about tariff impacts, AI-driven productivity gains, and consumer spending sustainability.

### 12. Commercial Office Vacancy Rate Falls to 18.2%, Manhattan and Miami Lead Recovery
*Jan 2026*

> The national office vacancy rate reached 18.2% in January 2026, following a decrease of 150 basis points year-over-year, representing an improvement from the previous year though vacancy rates remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, while the national office listing rate averaged $32.55 per square foot—2.5% lower than values recorded 12 months prior.

Manhattan, N.Y., and Miami averaged some of the lowest vacancy rates among the top U.S. office markets in January, while the Phoenix office market reached an inflection point with vacancy declining year-over-year to 16.3% following 840,000 SF of positive net absorption in 2025. Minneapolis/Twin Cities maintained vacancy at 17.8%—the only large market in the region to finish below the national average.

Many major markets are seeing vacancy rates above 20%, indicating continued challenges in the office sector as companies embrace hybrid work policies and reduce physical office footprints. The market is experiencing a "flight to quality" dynamic where tenants are moving to newer, premium buildings with better amenities, leaving older properties with significantly higher vacancy rates.

The divergent recovery across markets and property types suggests the office sector faces years of adjustment as companies optimize real estate portfolios for hybrid work models. Class A properties in prime locations are seeing healthy demand and rising rents, while Class B and C properties struggle with elevated vacancies and face potential obsolescence requiring major capital investment or conversion to residential or other uses.

### 13. Food Prices Rise 2.9% Year-Over-Year as Inflation Moderates from Recent Peaks
*Feb 13*

> The average price of food in the United States rose by 2.9% in the 12 months ending January, after posting an annual increase of 3.1% for December, according to data published February 13, 2026, with "food at home" (grocery stores) logging year-over-year increases of 2.1% while "food away from home" (restaurants) rose 4.0%.

The data shows food inflation has moderated significantly from recent peaks, though prices remain elevated compared to 2019 levels. In the euro area, food inflation rose for the first time since July, though it remained relatively moderate, while the OECD showed food inflation and core inflation showed little change while energy inflation fell in December 2025.

According to the FAO's Food Price Monitoring bulletin from February 12, 2026, world maize prices remained broadly stable in January 2026, underpinned by ample global supplies, while developments in global wheat prices were mixed, reflecting differing influences across major exporters including winterkill risks, exchange rate movements, and the onset of new season harvests in the Southern Hemisphere.

The moderating food inflation provides some relief to consumers but prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels, contributing to ongoing cost-of-living pressures particularly for lower-income households that spend a larger share of income on food and necessities. Agricultural commodity markets face uncertainty from weather patterns, trade policy changes, and shifting demand as alternative protein sources gain market share.

### 14. Airline Industry Sees Record Demand Continue into 2026, Premium Travel Outpaces Economy
*Feb 2026*

> Demand continues to be strong in the aviation industry despite concerns around economic growth and consumer confidence, with air travel around the world seeing record-high demand in 2025 carrying into 2026, while premium airline traffic growth consistently outpaces economy travel with the largest carriers reporting significant upticks in premium cabin bookings.

When comparing January 2026 prices to January 2025, U.S. airfares are up by 2.2%, while corporate travel airfares are forecast to rise 3.7% in 2026. Corporate travel budgets are projected to rise by 5% globally in 2026, with travel managers forecasting higher year-over-year hotel bookings, airline passenger volumes and airfares.

The International Air Transport Association cited "robust demand" for premium travel in a December outlook, particularly in Asia, Europe and North America. About 61% of corporate travel survey respondents said they are "very optimistic" or "somewhat optimistic" about the outlook for 2026, up from 50% in the 2025 midyear survey.

Despite strong demand, airline costs may outpace revenues due to wage and inflation adjustments. Additionally, supply chain issues and decarbonization were significant challenges for the industry in 2025 and will likely continue to be challenges in 2026, as airlines balance the need to expand capacity with sustainability commitments and regulatory pressures to reduce carbon emissions.

### 15. Tesla Deliveries Plummet for Second Consecutive Year as EV Demand Weakens
*Jan 2026*

> Tesla reported an 8.6% drop in deliveries to 1.64 million for the full year 2025, delivering 418,227 EVs in Q4 2025—representing an 8.5% drop compared to 2024—as sales declined for two years in a row for the first time in the company's history, while BYD overtook Tesla as the world's largest EV maker.

Musk acknowledged "some blowback" from his political involvement was hurting the company, while analysts expect the company to face challenges with demand again in 2026, with the average estimate for deliveries plunging to roughly 1.8 million vehicles. Musk stated that 2026 "is going to be a very big CapEx year" with CFO Vaibhav Taneja pegging total 2026 capex spend as "more than $20 billion."

BYD sold 4,602,436 new energy vehicles in 2025, becoming the world's top EV maker and surpassing Tesla's deliveries. However, BYD sold just 83,249 battery electric passenger cars in January 2026—the lowest on a monthly basis since the company sold 121,748 cars in February 2024—though the company targets 1.3 million overseas shipments in 2026 (up 24% from 2025).

The divergent trajectories reflect intensifying global EV competition, with Chinese manufacturers offering lower-priced vehicles capturing market share while Western automakers struggle with profitability and demand challenges. Tariffs, charging infrastructure gaps, and consumer concerns about range and resale values continue to moderate EV adoption rates in key markets, though industry analysts expect long-term electrification trends to resume once these barriers are addressed.
