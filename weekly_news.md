## Geopolitical News (Top 15)

### 1. Russia Launches Largest Aerial Assault of 2026 on Ukraine Energy Infrastructure
*Feb 3*

> Russia launched 71 missiles and 450 drones against Ukrainian power facilities in the most devastating energy attack of the year, leaving hundreds of thousands without heat during subzero temperatures immediately after a Trump-brokered energy truce expired.

The attack came just hours after the expiration of a brief pause in strikes on energy infrastructure that both Moscow and Kyiv had agreed to at the request of President Trump. Ukrainian President Zelensky accused Russia of using the pause not for diplomatic purposes but to stockpile missiles, then striking deliberately on the coldest days of the year when temperatures plunged to -20°C across much of the country.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy provider, described the February 3 assault as "the most severe" since the start of 2026. More than 1,170 high-rise buildings in Kyiv lost heating, while a power plant in Kharkiv was damaged beyond repair, leaving 300,000 residents without electricity. In Odesa, over 50,000 people lost power as temperatures remained dangerously cold.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 38 missiles and 412 drones, but the strikes that got through caused catastrophic damage. DTEK's CEO noted that Ukraine has now lost approximately 70% of its generation capacity, with many civilians receiving only 3-4 hours of electricity daily. The energy crisis has driven an estimated 600,000 people to leave Kyiv since the war began.

### 2. SpaceX Blocks Russian Forces' Unauthorized Starlink Access After Ukraine's Plea
*Feb 5*

> Elon Musk's SpaceX deactivated Starlink internet terminals used by Russian military forces in Ukraine after Kyiv provided evidence of "hundreds" of drone attacks guided by the satellite system, with Russian military bloggers confirming widespread outages across the front lines.

Ukraine's defense ministry launched a verification of all Starlink terminals operating in the country after discovering that Moscow troops had been mounting Starlink systems on attack drones to strike deeper into Ukrainian territory. The unauthorized use began in September 2024, with the Rubikon company equipping Molniya strike drones with Starlink systems starting December 2025.

Ukrainian officials created a "white list" of verified Starlink terminals used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and sent them to SpaceX, requesting that Musk keep these operational while shutting down all others in the theater. Pro-Russian military bloggers confirmed sweeping outages that weakened Moscow's ability to wage drone warfare and hindered coordination between units.

Musk responded on X that SpaceX's efforts to halt "unauthorized" Russian use appeared successful, posting "Let us know if more needs to be done." The Ukrainian Defense Ministry confirmed that Russian terminals had been "cut off," representing a significant blow to Russia's drone warfare capabilities just as it launched its largest aerial assault of the year.

### 3. US-India Announce Landmark Trade Deal, Reducing Tariffs from 50% to 18%
*Feb 2*

> President Trump announced a breakthrough trade agreement with India, immediately reducing tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% after Prime Minister Modi agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and commit to over $500 billion in American purchases.

The deal ended a year-long tariff standoff between the two nations, with Trump also dropping the separate 25% tariff imposed over India's Russian oil imports. Under the agreement, India pledged to eliminate tariffs on American industrial goods while being allowed to maintain protections for its agricultural sector. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal called it "the father of all deals."

Indian markets surged on the news, with the Nifty 50 jumping nearly 5% and the rupee strengthening to 90.40—its best day since November 2022. Twenty-seven of 30 Sensex stocks traded positive as trade war fears eased. The 18% US tariff rate positions India more favorably than regional competitors in the battle for American market access.

However, analysts cautioned that legally binding text has yet to materialize. Prime Minister Modi notably did not mention the Russian oil commitment or tariff elimination in his public response to Trump's announcement, raising questions about how the deal will be implemented and whether it can withstand political scrutiny in both countries.

### 4. Australia and Indonesia Sign Historic Security Treaty for Defense Cooperation
*Feb 6*

> Australia and Indonesia signed a comprehensive security treaty establishing new military training facilities and closer defense cooperation, as Southeast Asia's largest economy aligns more closely with its southern neighbor amid rising great power competition.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed the agreement as "a historic moment in our nations' relationship," building upon a 2024 defense pact that pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region. The treaty creates a framework for joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and the development of training facilities in Indonesian territory.

The agreement comes as both nations navigate increasingly complex security dynamics, with China's military assertiveness in the South China Sea and the shifting priorities of the United States under President Trump creating pressure for regional powers to strengthen bilateral ties. Indonesia's strategic location straddling major shipping lanes makes the partnership particularly significant.

The treaty represents a significant warming of relations that were strained in previous decades over issues including East Timor and asylum seekers. Defense analysts note the agreement signals Indonesia's willingness to engage more deeply with traditional Western security partners while maintaining its non-aligned foreign policy stance, balancing relationships with both Washington and Beijing.

### 5. Trump Administration Moves to Strip Job Protections from 50,000 Federal Workers
*Feb 6*

> The Office of Personnel Management issued a final rule creating a new employment classification that will remove civil service protections from an estimated 50,000 "policy-influencing" federal employees, making them at-will workers who can be fired at the president's discretion.

Under the "Schedule Policy/Career" classification, reclassified employees will lose the ability to appeal disciplinary actions, suspensions, demotions, or firings to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Starting March 9, these employees could be converted to at-will status at Trump's discretion, representing the most significant restructuring of federal employment since the civil service system was established.

The proposal received over 40,000 public comments during its 45-day comment period, with approximately 94% opposing the regulation. Unions representing federal workers condemned the move as an attempt to politicize the civil service and create a workforce loyal to the president rather than to their professional responsibilities and the public interest.

The Office of Personnel Management data shows that 242,260 employees have left the federal workforce—voluntarily or involuntarily—since Trump took office for his second term. Combined with the earlier DOGE initiative that reduced the federal civilian workforce by 9% in 2025, the administration has achieved the most dramatic reduction in government employment since World War II.

### 6. Xi Jinping and Trump Hold Phone Call, Discussing Taiwan and Trade Ahead of Summit
*Feb 5*

> President Xi Jinping emphasized that Taiwan is "the most important issue in China-U.S. relations" during a phone call with President Trump, as the two leaders discussed trade tensions and geopolitical flashpoints ahead of a planned face-to-face meeting in April.

The call came after Xi held a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Putin confirmed plans to visit China in the first half of 2026. The timing highlighted Beijing's careful balancing act between maintaining its strategic partnership with Moscow while managing the increasingly complex relationship with Washington under Trump's trade-focused foreign policy.

Xi noted that over the past year the two countries have enjoyed sound communication following their successful meeting in Busan, which charted the direction for China-U.S. relations. However, he made clear that Taiwan remains a red line, declaring that "Taiwan is China's territory" and any American actions regarding the island could fundamentally damage bilateral ties.

The planned April summit will be closely watched for signs of progress on trade issues, particularly as Trump's tariff threats against allies and adversaries alike have created uncertainty in global markets. Western leaders including Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney, the UK's Keir Starmer, and Germany's Friedrich Merz have all visited or plan to visit Beijing, reflecting China's central role in global economic and security calculations.

### 7. ASEAN Refuses to Recognize Myanmar's Junta-Led Elections
*Feb 1*

> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations issued a formal statement rejecting the legitimacy of elections held in Myanmar, marking a significant escalation in regional pressure on the military junta as the country approaches five years since the February 2021 coup.

The elections, held in December 2025 and January 2026, were designed to provide a "controlled veneer of legitimacy" for the military government, according to analysts. However, the junta remains unable to assert full authority across the country, with resistance forces controlling significant territory and ongoing armed conflict preventing voting in many regions.

Myanmar, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, remains among the countries most susceptible to major civil unrest in Asia through 2026, according to intelligence assessments. Economic hardship, inflation, and widespread corruption continue to fuel protests, while armed resistance groups have made significant territorial gains against the military.

The media landscape in Myanmar continues to deteriorate as the nation approaches the fifth anniversary of the coup. New legislation across South Korea, Australia, and Indonesia affecting press freedom has drawn regional attention, while journalists in Myanmar face ongoing persecution, arbitrary detention, and violence for reporting on the conflict.

### 8. Bangladesh Heads to Polls After Two Years of Political Upheaval
*Feb 6*

> Bangladeshis are set to vote on February 12 in national elections that will determine the country's direction nearly two years after the July Uprising of 2024 that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a violent popular revolt.

The Islamic conservative party Jamaat-e-Islami announced it would maintain "constructive and cooperative" relations with neighboring countries including India as part of its election platform. The party's outreach to New Delhi represents an attempt to reassure regional powers concerned about political instability in the densely populated nation of 170 million.

The elections come amid continued civil unrest that intelligence analysts predict will persist into 2026. Economic hardship, inflation, and public anger over widespread corruption drove the protests that toppled Hasina's government, and these underlying conditions remain largely unaddressed nearly two years later.

Bangladesh's relationship with India has been strained since the 2024 uprising, with concerns in New Delhi about the treatment of Hindu minorities and the rise of Islamic political movements. The election results will significantly impact India's eastern security calculus and the broader dynamics of South Asian geopolitics.

### 9. Trump Abandons Greenland Tariff Threats After European Backlash
*Feb 1*

> President Trump canceled threatened tariffs on eight European nations that were scheduled to take effect on February 1, backing away from his demand that Denmark sell Greenland to the United States after the crisis sparked a significant deterioration in European public opinion of America.

Trump had initially announced a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, with threats to increase duties to 25% by June 1 unless Denmark agreed to cede Greenland. At the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, Trump reversed his position, pledging not to use force or tariffs to acquire the autonomous territory.

The crisis prompted Denmark to deploy hundreds of elite combat soldiers trained in arctic warfare to Greenland, including the Chief of the Royal Danish Army. A YouGov poll from February 2026 showed the standoff led to a significant increase in unfavorable views of the United States across Western Europe, potentially complicating future diplomatic initiatives.

Despite the de-escalation, Trump's broader tariff agenda continues to reshape transatlantic relations. The administration maintains 10% tariffs on European goods that took effect February 1 under separate trade disputes, with threats of further escalation if trade imbalances are not addressed to Washington's satisfaction.

### 10. Ethiopia and Kenya Launch Joint Defense Committee Amid Regional Security Cooperation
*Feb 4*

> Ethiopia and Kenya concluded the inaugural meeting of their Joint Defence Committee, institutionalizing bilateral defense cooperation as the two nations emerge as primary drivers of East Africa's economic and security architecture.

The three-day meeting in Nairobi followed the signing of a Defense Cooperation Agreement that established a framework for coordinating military relations between the neighboring countries. The partnership aims to address shared security threats including terrorism, border instability, and the spillover effects of conflicts in Somalia and Sudan.

Ethiopia is positioning itself as Africa's "green powerhouse," generating over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources through decades of investment in hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal infrastructure. Surplus electricity from large hydropower stations is increasingly exported to Kenya and Sudan under regional power trade agreements, strengthening economic interdependence.

The UN projects Ethiopia and Kenya will be the main drivers of East Africa's economic expansion in 2026, with the region's economy expected to grow by 5.8%—up from 5.4% in 2025—outperforming all other African sub-regions. This economic dynamism is enabling both countries to invest more heavily in defense and regional security initiatives.

### 11. DRC Peace Process Launched with Former African Leaders as Facilitators
*Feb 5*

> African nations appointed former Kenya president Uhuru Kenyatta, former Ethiopia prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and former Nigeria president Olusegun Obasanjo as facilitators of a new peace process for the Democratic Republic of Congo, as fighting continues in the mineral-rich east.

The appointment of the elder statesmen comes as Rwanda's President Kagame continues to defy international pressure over the DRC conflict, with the M23 rebel group—widely understood to receive Rwandan backing—controlling significant territory including the Rubaya coltan mines that produce 15% of the world's supply of the critical mineral used in electronics.

Kenya faces its own humanitarian crisis as a deepening drought pushes pastoralist families to the brink, with livestock losses spreading across the arid north. The dual crises of conflict in the DRC and climate-related disasters across the Horn of Africa are straining regional resources and diplomatic bandwidth.

The new peace process faces significant obstacles, as previous initiatives have failed to address the fundamental drivers of conflict: control over mineral wealth, ethnic tensions, and the competing interests of regional powers. The facilitators must navigate these challenges while managing pressure from Western nations and China, both of which have significant economic interests in the DRC's mineral sector.

### 12. Super Bowl LX Set for Sunday as Seahawks Face Patriots in Epic Rematch
*Feb 6*

> The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare to face off at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday in a Super Bowl rematch of their legendary 2015 clash, with both teams having finished the season at 14-3.

The NFL Honors ceremony on Thursday announced Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford as the league's Most Valuable Player, while the 2026 Hall of Fame class was revealed: Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly, Adam Vinatieri, and Roger Craig. The class includes three of the NFL's all-time greats at their positions.

Seattle enters as 4.5-point favorites, with quarterback Sam Darnold and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba leading an explosive offense. Bad Bunny will headline the halftime show, with Charlie Puth performing the national anthem and Green Day opening the ceremony. Brandi Carlile will sing "America the Beautiful" and Coco Jones will perform "Lift Every Voice and Sing."

The game carries enormous stakes for both franchises. A Seahawks victory would help erase the bitter memory of Malcolm Butler's game-winning interception at the goal line in Super Bowl XLIX. For New England, a win would mark the Patriots' seventh championship and validate the team's complete rebuild since Tom Brady's departure.

### 13. European Leaders Face Mounting Unpopularity as Reform Agendas Stall
*Feb 4*

> France, Germany, and the United Kingdom entered 2026 with historically unpopular governments, with polling showing just 18% of Britons viewing Keir Starmer favorably and only 16% of French respondents holding a positive view of Emmanuel Macron.

Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in May 2025 after February's snap election, began his term with just 38% approval—which had fallen to 32% by December. His coalition faces pressure from five upcoming state elections where the far-right Alternative for Germany is expected to gain seats, limiting his ability to pursue controversial reforms.

France entered 2026 for the second consecutive year without an approved budget after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu's minority government collapsed under pressure from both left and right. A new budget agreement is expected by late February or March, but the political paralysis has limited the government's ability to respond to economic challenges or the Trump administration's trade demands.

In the UK, domestic pressure grows on Starmer to pursue closer economic integration with the European Union, including potentially joining the customs union. However, official talks between London and Brussels have gone nowhere, leaving Britain isolated between an uninterested Europe and a Trump administration focused on bilateral trade confrontation.

### 14. Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana to Lead Latin American Oil Production Surge
*Feb 5*

> Latin America's three emerging oil powers—Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana—are projected to add more than 700,000 barrels per day of production in 2026, far outpacing a potential 300,000 bpd contribution from Venezuela as the region reshapes global energy markets.

Brazil leads the surge, with production expected to exceed 4.2 million barrels per day this year. The increase is specifically linked to ramp-ups and start-ups of new floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels in the country's prolific pre-salt offshore fields. Petrobras and international partners continue to invest heavily in the deep-water Santos and Campos basins.

Argentina's shale revolution is accelerating, with investment in the Vaca Muerta formation expected to drive Latin American shale sector spending to nearly $11 billion in 2026, up from $9.4 billion in 2025. The country's vast unconventional resources are attracting international capital despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges.

Despite sanctions relief, Venezuela's oil output is projected to lag regional competitors through 2030. Years of underinvestment, mismanagement, and the departure of international partners have left the country's once-mighty oil industry struggling to ramp production, even as global demand and prices create incentives for increased output.

### 15. India Assumes BRICS Presidency, Pushes Local Currency Trade Agenda
*Feb 1*

> India took over the BRICS chairship for the fourth time with a focus on "Building for Resilience, Innovation, Cooperation and Sustainability," promoting trade in local currencies while carefully distancing itself from proposals for a common BRICS currency that have raised concerns in Washington.

Prime Minister Modi announced he would give "a new form" to BRICS during India's tenure, emphasizing policy coordination, development finance, trade facilitation, and reform of global institutional governance. India's Rupee-Rouble trade with Russia is estimated to now account for over 90% of bilateral commerce, demonstrating the growing viability of de-dollarized transactions.

India's BRICS presidency gains particular significance amid global geopolitical turbulence, with New Delhi navigating complex relationships with both the United States—following the landmark trade deal announced on February 2—and its traditional strategic partner Russia. The balancing act requires careful diplomacy as Washington increases pressure on nations to reduce ties with Moscow.

The expanded BRICS+ grouping now includes Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Iran, creating a coalition that represents a significant share of global population, GDP, and energy production. India's leadership will be tested by managing diverse interests within the group while advancing its own strategic objectives in an increasingly multipolar world.

## Financial News (Top 15)

### 1. Alphabet Announces $185 Billion AI Spending Plan, Doubling 2025 Investment
*Feb 4*

> Google's parent company reported record fourth-quarter earnings while projecting capital expenditures of up to $185 billion for 2026—more than double its $91.4 billion spend in 2025—as CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the "staggering" scale of AI infrastructure investment is keeping him up at night.

Alphabet beat Wall Street expectations, reporting earnings per share of $2.82 versus $2.63 estimated and revenue of $113.83 billion versus $111.43 billion expected. The company's annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time, with net income growing 15% to $132.2 billion. Google Cloud revenues surged 48% to $17.7 billion, driven by enterprise AI solutions.

The company's Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter. Alphabet achieved a 78% reduction in Gemini serving unit costs over 2025 through model optimizations and efficiency improvements. Pichai emphasized that AI is driving Search revenue growth as users engage with Google's AI mode features.

Despite the strong earnings, shares traded flat as investors weighed the massive spending commitment. The $185 billion guidance represents the largest capital expenditure plan ever announced by a technology company, raising questions about returns on AI infrastructure investment even as competitors race to match Alphabet's spending.

### 2. Waymo Raises $16 Billion at $126 Billion Valuation, Plans Global Robotaxi Expansion
*Feb 2*

> Alphabet's autonomous driving unit secured the largest investment ever in an autonomous vehicle company, with Dragoneer, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital leading a round that values Waymo at $126 billion—more than double its valuation from the October 2024 funding round.

The investor roster reads like a who's who of Silicon Valley: Andreessen Horowitz, Mubadala Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, T. Rowe Price, BDT & MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek all participated. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.

Waymo plans to use the capital to expand to over 20 new cities in 2026, including its first international markets. Tokyo and London are confirmed as the company's initial overseas destinations, marking a significant milestone in the global deployment of autonomous vehicle technology. The expansion will require substantial investment in local regulatory approvals, mapping, and support infrastructure.

The massive valuation reflects investor confidence in Waymo's technological lead over competitors following General Motors' decision to shut down its Cruise robotaxi unit. With Tesla still struggling to deliver on autonomous driving promises and Chinese competitors facing geopolitical headwinds, Waymo appears positioned to capture the lion's share of the emerging robotaxi market.

### 3. Big Tech AI Spending Approaches $700 Billion as Hyperscalers Double Down
*Feb 6*

> The four major cloud hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—announced combined 2026 capital expenditure plans approaching $700 billion, up from $350 billion in 2025, as the AI infrastructure arms race enters a new phase of intensity.

Meta intends to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion in capex for 2026, joining Alphabet's $175-185 billion commitment. Microsoft and Amazon are also scaling investments dramatically, though exact figures vary. The spending surge reflects fierce competition to secure GPU capacity from Nvidia and build data center infrastructure capable of training and serving increasingly powerful AI models.

Oracle announced plans to raise $45-50 billion this year through debt and equity financing to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity for its largest customers including AMD and Meta. The company is selling $25 billion in investment-grade bonds as part of the effort, highlighting how the AI boom is reshaping corporate finance across the technology sector.

The massive spending is taking a significant toll on cash reserves. Analysts note that while revenue growth remains strong, free cash flow is being consumed by infrastructure investment at an unprecedented rate. The question of whether this spending will generate adequate returns remains the central uncertainty for technology investors.

### 4. Disney Experiences Division Crosses $10 Billion in Quarterly Revenue for First Time
*Feb 2*

> Walt Disney Company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates, with its theme parks, resorts, and cruises division posting record revenue, though shares fell 7% after investors focused on slowing streaming growth and succession uncertainty.

Overall revenue for the quarter was roughly $26 billion, up 5% year over year, with the experiences division generating $10 billion for the first time in history. Domestic theme parks recorded $6.91 billion in revenue while international parks reported $1.75 billion—each up 7% compared with the prior-year period. The cruise line expansion is contributing increasingly to the segment's performance.

Net income for the quarter was $2.48 billion, or $1.34 per share, down from $2.64 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items including tax charges related to a deal with Fubo, Disney reported $1.63 in earnings per share, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.58.

Despite the strong operational performance, Disney shares came under pressure as investors digested news about CEO Bob Iger's succession timeline. The company reaffirmed its plan to repurchase $7 billion in stock for fiscal 2026, projected double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and expects $19 billion in cash provided by operations—but questions about leadership transition overshadowed the results.

### 5. Tesla Reports First-Ever Annual Revenue Decline as Musk Pivots to AI and Robotics
*Feb 2*

> Tesla reported 2025 full-year revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3% from $97.7 billion the previous year—the first annual decline in the electric vehicle maker's history—as CEO Elon Musk announced plans to end Model S and Model X production to make room for Optimus humanoid robots.

Fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations with adjusted EPS of 50 cents versus 45 cents estimated on revenue of $24.90 billion. However, net profit fell 61% to $840 million for the quarter, bringing full-year profit to $3.8 billion—down sharply from $7.1 billion in 2024. The margin compression reflects intensified price competition in the global EV market.

During the earnings call, Musk outlined a dramatic strategic transformation: Tesla will transition from an EV manufacturer to "a full-blown real-world AI and robotics company." Model S and Model X production will end in Q2 2026, with Fremont factory space converted to manufacture Optimus humanoid robots. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said investors should expect approximately $20 billion in capital expenditure for 2026.

Musk claimed Tesla's robotaxi service has been "rolled out in a few cities" and will be "very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US." The bold prediction drew skepticism from analysts who noted regulatory hurdles and the company's history of missed autonomous driving timelines. Wall Street's median year-end target implies roughly 10% upside from current levels.

### 6. Eli Lilly Posts Blowout Earnings as Weight Loss Drug Demand Soars
*Feb 4*

> The pharmaceutical giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, crushing Wall Street expectations as blockbuster demand for weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro drives unprecedented revenue growth.

Eli Lilly guided to 2026 revenue between $80 billion and $83 billion, dramatically exceeding analyst expectations of $77.62 billion. The company projects adjusted earnings between $33.50 and $35 per share, compared with the $33.23 consensus estimate. The guidance implies continued market share gains in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 drug category.

The earnings report contrasted sharply with Novo Nordisk's struggles earlier in the week, as Lilly appeared to be winning the competitive battle for weight loss drug market share. Production capacity investments are paying off, allowing Lilly to meet surging demand while Novo Nordisk faces supply constraints that have limited its growth.

The company's success reflects broader transformation in the pharmaceutical industry, as GLP-1 drugs emerge as potentially the largest drug class in history. Beyond obesity and diabetes, trials are exploring applications in cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and other conditions—expanding the total addressable market beyond current analyst models.

### 7. Pfizer Beats Estimates Despite Declining COVID Revenue, Reaffirms Modest Outlook
*Feb 3*

> Pfizer reported fourth-quarter results that topped analyst expectations even as demand for its COVID-19 products continued to decline, while reaffirming a 2026 outlook that projects essentially flat revenue compared to 2025 levels.

The company expects 2026 adjusted profit between $2.80 and $3.00 per share, with revenue totaling $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. The guidance reflects the challenges of managing a post-pandemic portfolio as COVID vaccine and treatment revenues fade while the company works to develop new growth drivers.

Pfizer's results stand in stark contrast to the explosive growth reported by competitors like Eli Lilly, highlighting the divergent fortunes of pharmaceutical companies depending on their exposure to the GLP-1 weight loss drug category. Pfizer's attempts to enter the obesity market have faced setbacks, leaving the company without a clear path to matching rivals' growth rates.

The company continues to invest in its oncology pipeline and other therapeutic areas, but investors remain skeptical about the timeline for meaningful revenue contributions. The modest guidance keeps Pfizer in a transition period as it seeks to replace pandemic-era profits with sustainable new product revenues.

### 8. Mortgage Rates Fall to Three-Year Lows as Housing Activity Improves
*Feb 5*

> The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.11%, the lowest level in more than three years, driving a surge in purchase applications and refinance activity as the spring selling season approaches.

Freddie Mac reported the 15-year fixed mortgage averaged 5.50%, while some lenders offered rates below 6% for well-qualified borrowers. The decline followed the Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates steady while signaling openness to future cuts. Analysts at Morgan Stanley project rates could hit 5.75% later this year if inflation continues to moderate.

Purchase and refinance applications have jumped year-over-year as lower rates create opportunities for both first-time buyers and existing homeowners seeking to reduce monthly payments. Mortgage industry experts note that housing activity "is improving and poised for a solid spring sales season" after two years of elevated rate headwinds.

A recent analysis revealed that a surprising share of homeowners still carry mortgage rates above 5%, creating significant refinance demand as rates decline. The combination of pent-up buyer demand, falling rates, and limited inventory could produce competitive spring housing markets despite affordability challenges persisting in many metropolitan areas.

### 9. CFPB Secures Emergency Funding Through March After Court Rejects Shutdown Attempt
*Feb 4*

> The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau obtained $145 million in emergency funding from the Federal Reserve after a federal judge ruled in December that the Trump administration cannot close a congressionally-created agency without an act of Congress.

Acting Director Russell Vought had attempted to effectively shut down the CFPB in February 2025 by ordering staff to stop work on proposed rules, suspend finalized regulations, halt investigations, and cease supervision and examination activities. Most staff were placed on administrative leave as the administration sought to eliminate the consumer watchdog agency.

The December 30, 2025 court ruling rejected Vought's argument that he could unilaterally close the agency, ordering the CFPB to remain funded and operational. The $145 million transfer from the Federal Reserve Board will allow the agency to continue operations through at least March 2026, though its long-term future remains uncertain.

Consumer advocacy groups have warned that the ongoing attempts to neutralize the CFPB leave Americans more vulnerable to predatory lending, debt collection abuses, and financial fraud. Industry groups have welcomed the reduced regulatory oversight, arguing the agency exceeded its statutory authority under previous leadership.

### 10. GM Projects $4 Billion in Tariff Costs for 2026 Despite Increased US Production
*Feb 3*

> General Motors announced plans to top Ford in US vehicle production while warning that tariff costs will reach between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2026, highlighting the significant financial burden of trade policy on American automakers.

CEO Mary Barra outlined the production targets as part of the company's 2025 earnings report and 2026 guidance. The expansion of domestic manufacturing is partly designed to mitigate tariff exposure, but vehicles and components that cross borders multiple times during production still face significant duties under current trade policies.

The tariff burden comes as GM navigates the costly transition to electric vehicles while maintaining profitability in its traditional internal combustion engine business. The company must balance investment in next-generation technology against the headwinds of trade policy and increasingly competitive global EV markets.

Ford is scheduled to report earnings on February 10 and is expected to face similar tariff challenges. Both Detroit automakers have warned that tariff costs are being passed along to consumers through higher vehicle prices, contributing to affordability challenges that have dampened new car demand despite strong consumer interest.

### 11. Semiconductor Industry Enters 2nm Manufacturing Race as AI Demand Strains Supply
*Feb 2*

> TSMC's 2nm process entered mass production with strong yields as the company battles Samsung and Intel for AI chip supremacy, with Apple reportedly exploring alternative foundries as capacity constraints force diversification of the global semiconductor supply chain.

TSMC sees its AI revenue growing at a mid- to high-50% compound annual growth rate through 2029, with Nvidia now surpassing Apple as the company's largest customer. Capacity is expected to ramp faster in 2026 driven by smartphones, high-performance computing, and AI applications, but demand continues to outpace supply.

Intel's 18A node has allowed the American chipmaker to regain technical parity with TSMC by some metrics, featuring power delivery innovation that TSMC does not expect to match until late 2026. Samsung's SF2 node offers unique design flexibility, enabling engineers to optimize for either ultra-low-power mobile chips or high-performance AI accelerators.

The computer microchip market is projected to grow from $26.43 billion in 2025 to $29.1 billion in 2026, with a compound annual growth rate of 10.1%. Intel and Samsung have both commenced the transition from organic resin substrates to glass to meet the thermal and interconnect demands of generative AI, signaling the next phase of manufacturing innovation.

### 12. Saudi Arabia in Talks with Boeing and Airbus for Historic Aircraft Order
*Feb 5*

> Saudi Arabia's flagship carrier Saudia is negotiating with both Boeing and Airbus for what could be its largest plane purchase ever, seeking at least 150 narrowbody and widebody jets as the kingdom invests billions to become a global travel and tourism hub.

The potential order reflects Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative, which aims to diversify the economy away from oil dependence through massive investment in tourism, entertainment, and aviation infrastructure. The kingdom is developing new airports and expanding existing facilities to accommodate ambitious passenger growth targets.

Both Boeing and Airbus are positioning for the deal as they work to increase production rates significantly in 2026. Industry analysts project deliveries of 1,044 aircraft for Airbus and 708 for Boeing this year, rising to 1,188 and 870 respectively in 2027. Combined backlogs exceed 11 years, giving airlines limited alternatives for new aircraft.

Boeing has advanced the 737 Max 10 into the second phase of FAA flight testing, moving closer to certification of the stretched variant that would compete for narrowbody orders. The company is recovering from production challenges and regulatory scrutiny, while Airbus faces its own capacity constraints in meeting surging global demand.

### 13. Netflix Guides to $51 Billion Revenue as Ad Business Set to Double
*Feb 2*

> Netflix projected 2026 revenue between $50.7 billion and $51.7 billion, with advertising revenue expected to roughly double compared to 2025 as the streaming giant's ad-supported tier gains momentum in its second year of operation.

Fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share came in at 56 cents versus 55 cents estimated, with revenue of $12.05 billion versus $11.97 billion expected. Revenue during the period rose 18% year over year, driven by membership growth, higher subscription pricing, and increased advertising revenue from the tier launched in late 2024.

The company reported 325 million global subscribers, continuing its position as the world's largest streaming service despite intensifying competition. Password-sharing crackdowns implemented in 2024 have contributed to subscriber growth, while the ad-supported tier has attracted price-sensitive consumers who might otherwise have canceled.

Spotify also raised prices in February, increasing its Individual Premium plan from $11.99 to $12.99 per month. The price hike is expected to serve as a tailwind for earnings reports in the first and second quarters of 2026, as streaming services across audio and video demonstrate pricing power despite consumer concerns about subscription fatigue.

### 14. Fintech and Homebuilders Emerge as Midterm Election Trades
*Feb 3*

> Wall Street is positioning for the November midterm elections, with investors eyeing trades that would benefit from Trump administration efforts to lower the cost of living—particularly fintech firms and homebuilders that would see tailwinds if mortgage rates continue to decline.

The election-focused positioning comes as markets navigate heightened volatility driven by tariff uncertainty, AI spending concerns, and geopolitical tensions. With nine months until Americans vote for Congress, traders are gaming out scenarios where policy shifts could create sector-specific opportunities.

Homebuilders have attracted attention as mortgage rates fall to three-year lows, potentially unlocking pent-up housing demand. The sector's performance is closely tied to interest rate trajectory and consumer confidence—both of which could be influenced by the political environment and economic policy heading into the election.

Fintech companies that facilitate lower-cost financial services could benefit from an administration focused on reducing living costs. Payment processors, digital banks, and mortgage technology platforms are being evaluated for their exposure to potential regulatory tailwinds and consumer demand for affordable financial products.

### 15. US Manufacturing Expands for First Time in 12 Months as New Orders Surge
*Feb 2*

> The ISM Manufacturing Index showed factory activity expanding in January for the first time in a year, with surges in new orders and production signaling potential economic resilience despite ongoing tariff uncertainty and elevated interest rates.

The expansion ended the longest manufacturing contraction streak since the 2008 financial crisis, suggesting that industrial activity may be turning a corner. Transport stocks hit new all-time highs with the Dow Jones Transportation Average up 2%, led by United Airlines, Old Dominion, and Delta Air Lines.

Goldman Sachs expects the US to substantially outperform global growth forecasts—projecting 2.6% GDP growth versus the 2.0% consensus—due to reduced tariff drag, tax cuts, and easier financial conditions. The manufacturing rebound reinforces the bullish thesis that the economy can achieve a soft landing despite 18 months of restrictive monetary policy.

The sector rotation away from growth stocks reflects geopolitical turbulence driving commodity prices and defensive positioning. Energy led January sector performance at 14.37%, followed by materials and consumer staples. Health care, information technology, and financials ended January lower as investors reassessed growth expectations and valuation levels.
