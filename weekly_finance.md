## Inflation & Finance Metrics

### 1. January Layoffs Hit 108,435, Highest Start to Year Since 2009 Recession - *Feb 5*

> Employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, a 118% surge from a year earlier, with tech and finance sectors bearing the brunt as companies redirect spending toward AI infrastructure while trimming costs elsewhere.

U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, marking a 118% increase from the fewer than 50,000 announced a year ago and representing the worst start to a year for layoffs since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Amazon's 16,000 layoffs contributed heavily to the tech industry losing 22,291 jobs in January, extending a multi-year wave of workforce reductions into 2026 as firms redirect budgets toward artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and data centers while trimming costs in legacy operations.

Global technology companies and startups cut nearly 25,000 jobs in January alone, with major announcements including Meta's 1,500 job cuts representing about 10% of its Reality Labs division, software companies Autodesk and Pinterest each eliminating close to 1,000 roles, and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson announcing 1,600 role eliminations in Sweden as part of cost-saving measures. The layoff surge reflects a fundamental shift in capital allocation, with artificial intelligence cited for 7,624 cuts in January, though much of the downsizing represents budget redirections toward AI models, graphics processing units, cloud infrastructure, and large-scale data centers.

The January layoff figures mark a stark reversal from the tight labor market of 2021-2022 and signal mounting economic uncertainty despite relatively low unemployment rates. Some layoffs are scheduled through February 23, 2026, with affected employees receiving at least 90 days of pay, benefits, and job transition assistance. The concentration of layoffs in high-wage tech and finance sectors creates a paradox where aggregate employment figures remain stable while knowledge workers face unprecedented job insecurity, complicating the Federal Reserve's assessment of labor market health as it navigates monetary policy decisions in 2026.

### 2. S&P 500 Net Profit Margins Hit 13.2%, Highest Level Since 2009 Despite Recession Fears - *Feb 6*

> The blended net profit margin for S&P 500 companies reached 13.2% in Q4 2025, the highest since FactSet began tracking the metric in 2009, with 76% of companies beating earnings estimates by an aggregate 7.6%.

S&P 500 companies reported the highest net profit margin in over 15 years during Q4 2025, with the blended net profit margin reaching 13.2%, surpassing all previous quarters since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2009. The robust profitability comes despite persistent recession warnings and economic uncertainty, with corporations demonstrating pricing power and operational efficiency that has allowed them to maintain and expand margins even as revenue growth has moderated from pandemic-era peaks.

At the sector level, four sectors reported year-over-year increases in net profit margins compared to Q4 2024, led by Information Technology (29.0% vs. 26.8%) and Industrials (12.5% vs. 10.7%), reflecting continued strength in software, semiconductors, and capital equipment. However, six sectors reported year-over-year decreases, led by Real Estate (33.5% vs. 35.1%), suggesting divergence between technology-driven growth sectors and interest-rate-sensitive industries. The blended year-over-year earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 reached 13.0%, with 76% of companies reporting actual EPS above analyst estimates, beating consensus by an aggregate 7.6%.

Looking ahead, estimated net profit margins for Q1 2026 through Q4 2026 are projected at 13.2%, 13.8%, 14.2%, and 14.2% respectively, suggesting analysts expect margin expansion to continue through the year. The sustained profitability amid economic uncertainty highlights corporations' ability to pass costs to consumers, reduce operating expenses, and leverage technology to enhance productivity. However, the margin strength also raises questions about sustainability, as persistently high corporate profits could draw political scrutiny and regulatory pressure, particularly if consumer affordability continues to deteriorate.

### 3. Federal Reserve Ends Quantitative Tightening as Balance Sheet Stabilizes at $6.6 Trillion - *Dec 1, 2025*

> The Federal Reserve officially ended quantitative tightening on December 1, 2025, after reducing its securities holdings by $2.2 trillion since June 2022, with the balance sheet stabilizing at $6.6 trillion or 21% of GDP.

The Federal Reserve concluded its quantitative tightening program on December 1, 2025, marking the end of a three-and-a-half-year effort to normalize its balance sheet following the massive pandemic-era expansion. Since balance sheet reduction began in June 2022, the Federal Reserve's total securities holdings declined by more than $2.2 trillion, with redemptions of approximately $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities and $600 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2025, the Fed's assets stood at $6.6 trillion, representing about 21% of GDP, down from the March 2022 peak of nearly $9 trillion but still dramatically above pre-pandemic levels of $800 billion or 6% of GDP in December 2005.

The FOMC directed the Desk to roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills, signaling a shift from active balance sheet reduction to maintenance mode. The Fed will likely use reserve management purchases (RMPs) in the coming months to help maintain liquidity without affecting longer-term borrowing costs, which is a goal reserved for quantitative easing (QE). This approach allows the Fed to provide short-term liquidity support while avoiding the market distortions and inflation risks associated with large-scale asset purchases.

The end of quantitative tightening comes amid persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target and ongoing debate about the appropriate size of the central bank's balance sheet. Some economists argue that the Fed should continue reducing its holdings to pre-pandemic levels to avoid market dependency on central bank support, while others contend that the larger balance sheet is necessary to ensure adequate financial system liquidity given the growth of the economy and financial markets since 2008. The FOMC's decision to halt QT while maintaining elevated holdings suggests a pragmatic middle ground, preserving optionality to resume asset purchases if economic conditions deteriorate while avoiding the risks of overly aggressive balance sheet reduction.

### 4. JPMorgan Chase Reports Record $185.6 Billion Annual Revenue Despite Q4 Reserve Charge - *Jan 13*

> JPMorgan Chase beat Q4 2025 earnings expectations with $5.23 per share versus $5.00 consensus, posting full-year managed revenue of $185.6 billion and net income of $57.0 billion despite a $2.2 billion Apple Card reserve charge.

JPMorgan Chase reported record annual financial performance for 2025, with managed revenue reaching $185.6 billion, net income of $57.0 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $20.02, despite taking a preannounced $2.2 billion reserve tied to its takeover of the Apple Card loan portfolio from Goldman Sachs. The bank's Q4 2025 results topped analyst expectations, with adjusted earnings of $5.23 per share versus $5.00 consensus estimate, and revenue of $46.77 billion versus $46.201 billion expected, driven by better-than-expected trading operations revenue.

J.P. Morgan Payments saw $5.1 billion in revenue in Q4 2025, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting the bank's dominance in corporate treasury services and merchant processing. Profit fell 7% to $13.03 billion, or $4.63 per share in Q4, primarily due to the Apple Card reserve charge, which the bank characterized as a one-time impact that should not affect future quarters. The bank's trading division delivered particularly strong results, benefiting from elevated market volatility and robust client activity in fixed income, currencies, and commodities.

Analysts expect U.S. bank earnings to rise by high single digits year-over-year in 2025, with JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs each reporting record or near-record annual hauls in trading fees. Bank of America reported Q4 earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $0.96, representing a potential 17% jump from the same period last year. Falling interest rates, rising Wall Street trading and advisory fees, stable consumer credit, and regulatory deregulation have all supported bank profitability, positioning the sector for continued growth in 2026 despite concerns about commercial real estate exposure and potential recession risks.

### 5. Real Wages Rose 0.9% in 2025 as Nominal Wage Growth Outpaced Inflation for 11th Straight Month - *Dec 10, 2025*

> Between December 2024 and December 2025, nominal wages grew 3.8% to $1,266 per week while inflation stood at 2.7%, resulting in real wage growth of 0.92% or $12 per week in inflation-adjusted purchasing power.

American workers experienced meaningful real wage growth in 2025, with inflation-adjusted earnings increasing 0.9% as nominal wage growth of 3.8% outpaced inflation of 2.7% for the full year. Between December 2024 and December 2025, the nominal average wage grew from $1,221 to $1,266—$45 more per week—with accounting for inflation yielding real wage growth of 0.92% or an additional $12 per week in purchasing power. Wage growth exceeded inflation in every month from February 2024 through December 2025, marking the longest sustained period of real wage gains since the pre-pandemic economy.

From December 2024 to December 2025, real average hourly earnings increased 0.9%, seasonally adjusted, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The change in real average hourly earnings combined with no change in the average workweek resulted in a 1.0% increase in real average weekly earnings over this period. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, which measures the median wage growth of individuals, showed similar trends, with wage growth concentrated among job switchers, who typically command higher compensation in tight labor markets than workers who remain with the same employer.

However, the real wage gains of 2025 only partially offset the purchasing power losses of 2021-2023, when inflation surged to multi-decade highs and real wages declined sharply. Cumulatively, workers still face higher costs for essentials like housing, food, and healthcare compared to pre-pandemic levels, even accounting for nominal wage increases. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release Real Earnings for January 2026 on February 11, providing the first data point for whether real wage growth continued into the new year or whether tariff-driven inflation has begun eroding workers' purchasing power.

## Crypto Market Developments

### 1. Bitcoin Mining Costs Reach $87,000 as Network Hashrate Rebounds to 913 EH/s - *Feb 5*

> Bitcoin trades near $70,000, roughly 20% below the estimated average production cost of $87,000, as the network hashrate rebounds to 913 EH/s and energy consumption surges to 854,400 kWh per Bitcoin, exceeding Belgium's daily electricity use.

Bitcoin miners faced intensifying financial pressure in February 2026 as the cryptocurrency's price of approximately $70,000 traded roughly 20% below the estimated average production cost of around $87,000, creating a profitability crisis across the industry. Bitcoin's network hashrate rebounded to 913 EH/s after experiencing significant volatility, having reached multiple all-time highs above 1 Zettahash/s (1,000 EH/s) in January 2026 before temporary weather-related curtailment caused sharp short-term declines. The surging hashrate to 894.5 EH/s increased the energy required to mine one Bitcoin to approximately 854,400 kWh, with daily Bitcoin mining now consuming more electricity than the entire country of Belgium over the same 24-hour period.

With revenues below operating costs, miners continued selling bitcoin holdings to fund day-to-day operations, cover energy expenses, and service debt, creating persistent selling pressure on the market. Major mining company HIVE produced 297 Bitcoin in January with 290% hashrate growth year-over-year, demonstrating the arms race dynamics driving hash power expansion even as individual mining profitability deteriorates. The next difficulty retarget scheduled for February 8-10, 2026, projects a downward adjustment of 16-18% to 116-121 trillion, representing one of the largest difficulty decreases in recent years and offering immediate margin relief if Bitcoin price stabilizes or climbs.

The combination of high production costs and compressed margins is forcing industry consolidation, with smaller and less efficient miners facing insolvency while well-capitalized operations with access to cheap renewable energy expand market share. The upcoming 16-18% difficulty drop offers a lifeline for struggling miners by reducing computational requirements and energy costs, potentially restoring profitability if Bitcoin price holds above $70,000. However, sustained prices below production costs threaten a wave of miner bankruptcies, equipment liquidations, and potential network security concerns if hashrate declines substantially in coming months.

### 2. Crypto Theft Surges to $370 Million in January 2026 as Phishing Attacks Dominate - *Jan 31*

> Cryptocurrency theft reached $370.3 million in January 2026, a 214% increase from December and four times January 2025 levels, with a single phishing incident accounting for $284 million as North Korean actors shift tactics from code exploits to operational compromise.

The cryptocurrency industry witnessed $370.3 million in theft during January 2026, marking a 214% increase from December and a fourfold rise from January 2025, according to blockchain security firm TRM Labs. A single phishing incident accounted for the majority of January's losses, with one victim losing $284 million to a social engineering scam, highlighting the evolving threat landscape as attackers shift from smart contract vulnerabilities to human-targeted deception. The rise in crypto thefts was driven largely by phishing attacks and social engineering schemes that often mimic legitimate services, such as customer support for wallet providers, to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

The cryptocurrency industry witnessed over $3.4 billion in theft from January through early December 2025, with the February 21, 2025, compromise of Bybit alone accounting for $1.5 billion—the largest single theft of cryptocurrencies in the industry's history. Sophisticated actors, particularly those linked to North Korea (DPRK), are no longer just exploiting code vulnerabilities but are compromising the operational foundations of crypto asset services and the ecosystems around them. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea continues to pose the most significant nation-state threat to cryptocurrency security, achieving a record-breaking year for stolen funds despite an assessed dramatic reduction in attack frequency.

TRM Labs' 2026 Crypto Crime Report indicates that while the total number of hacking incidents decreased in 2025, the average size of successful attacks increased substantially, suggesting attackers are focusing on higher-value targets and more sophisticated operational security compromises. Attack vectors have evolved from smart contract exploits and flash loan attacks to social engineering, insider threats, and supply chain compromises targeting infrastructure providers, exchanges, and custodians. The shift underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency crime from opportunistic code exploitation to organized, well-funded operations conducting reconnaissance, developing custom malware, and executing long-term infiltration campaigns against crypto companies.

### 3. Circle's USDC Outpaces Tether's USDT Growth for Second Year as Fidelity Launches FIDD - *Jan 6*

> Circle's USDC market cap increased 73% to $75.12 billion in 2025 while Tether's USDT added 36% to $186.6 billion, with Circle's outperformance driven by institutional demand for regulated stablecoins as Fidelity launches competing FIDD in February.

Circle Internet's USDC stablecoin grew faster than larger rival Tether's USDT for the second straight year in 2025, with USDC's market capitalization increasing 73% to $75.12 billion while USDT added 36% to $186.6 billion, fueled by rising institutional demand for regulated, blockchain-based dollars. JPMorgan analysis indicates USDC's outperformance is rooted in institutional demand for assets that meet regulatory guidelines, which prompted several high-profile investment banks and institutions to explore stablecoins, particularly regulated ones such as USDC. Tether's USDT remains unregulated in the U.S. and Europe, though the company operates as a licensed digital asset service provider in El Salvador.

The stablecoin landscape intensified in February 2026 with new entrants challenging the USDC-USDT duopoly. Fidelity Investments launched the Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD) stablecoin in early February to compete in the $308 billion stablecoin market, while Tether introduced USAT, its first U.S.-regulated dollar token aimed at institutional users, launched in partnership with federally chartered bank Anchorage Digital and Cantor Fitzgerald. USAT represents Tether's attempt to address regulatory criticism and capture institutional dollars that have increasingly favored Circle's USDC due to compliance and transparency concerns.

On February 4, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain reported that Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC collectively added more than $3 billion in newly minted supply over a three-day period, suggesting institutional accumulation or market-making activity despite the broader cryptocurrency market volatility. The entry of traditional finance giants like Fidelity validates the stablecoin market's importance while intensifying competitive pressure on Circle and Tether. Regulatory clarity remains the critical driver of stablecoin adoption, with Circle positioned to benefit from pending U.S. stablecoin legislation that would establish federal oversight and reserve requirements, potentially disadvantaging unregulated competitors.

### 4. Solana and XRP Dominate Altcoin Season as ETF Launches Drive Institutional Flows - *Jan 2*

> Solana hit 27.1 million active addresses in mid-January, a 56% weekly increase, while XRP ETFs attracted $1.37 billion in under 60 days with 43 consecutive days of positive inflows and exchange balances falling 57% to 1.7 billion tokens.

Solana and XRP emerged as the dominant altcoins of early 2026, with both networks experiencing explosive growth in adoption metrics, ETF inflows, and technical upgrades that position them as leading Layer-1 candidates for institutional integration. Solana became the most searched token since Q4 2024 and surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction volume, hitting 27.1 million active addresses in mid-January 2026, representing a 56% weekly increase. The network's planned major consensus upgrade with the new Alpenglow protocol, developed by Anza as a spinoff from Solana Labs, introduces Votor to finalize blocks in 100-150 milliseconds and Rotor, a more efficient data relay protocol.

XRP experienced a renaissance in early 2026 following Ripple's improved legal outlook after the SEC's dropped appeal and new XRP ETF approvals in global markets, positioning it as a regulated-friendly altcoin for institutional adoption. XRP ETFs attracted $1.37 billion in assets under management in under 60 days with 43 consecutive days of positive inflows, while exchange balances fell 57% to 1.7 billion tokens, suggesting holders are moving assets into long-term storage. Moscow Exchange (MOEX) announced plans to launch cash-settled futures tied to Solana, XRP, and TRON in 2026, expanding regulated derivative products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Cardano (ADA) also demonstrated strength, climbing 7% and outpacing broader market moves in early January, positioning itself as a leading Layer-1 candidate for meaningful growth in 2026 with advanced execution models, strong developer ecosystems, and real-world experimentation. The altcoin season narrative gained momentum as Bitcoin dominance declined from December peaks, with capital rotating into Layer-1 platforms offering smart contract functionality, DeFi ecosystems, and real-world payment applications. Analysts suggest Solana and XRP have strong potential to boom in 2026 due to major protocol upgrades, ETF optimism, rising institutional interest, and regulatory clarity that reduces legal uncertainty.

### 5. Ethereum Maintains 68% DeFi Dominance as TVL Reaches $70 Billion Despite Competition - *Jan 6*

> Ethereum accounts for approximately 68% of decentralized finance total value locked at $70 billion, exceeding Solana (8.96%), Bitcoin (6.67%), and all other chains combined as Layer-2 solutions and competitor blockchains compete for market share.

Ethereum maintained its overwhelming dominance of the decentralized finance sector in early 2026, accounting for approximately 68% of total value locked (TVL) at $70 billion, exceeding Solana, Tron, Arbitrum, and all other chains and Layer-2 solutions combined. The concentration of DeFi activity on Ethereum reflects the network's first-mover advantage, deep liquidity pools, extensive developer tooling, and battle-tested smart contract infrastructure that has weathered multiple market cycles and security challenges. Solana, the second-largest DeFi project by TVL, accounts for just 8.96% of the DeFi TVL share, while Bitcoin ranks third with 6.67% and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) holds fourth place.

The DeFi landscape in early January 2026 showed overall sector TVL has grown substantially from 2025 lows, driven by renewed interest in yield farming, liquid staking derivatives, and decentralized exchanges. However, Ethereum faces mounting competitive pressure from high-performance Layer-1 blockchains like Solana and Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism that offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees. The emergence of Bitcoin-based DeFi protocols leveraging wrapped BTC and Layer-2 networks demonstrates the expanding scope of decentralized finance beyond Ethereum's EVM ecosystem.

Despite competition, Ethereum's DeFi dominance reflects network effects, liquidity depth, and institutional trust that create significant switching costs for users and protocols. The upcoming Ethereum protocol upgrades focused on scaling, blob space expansion, and account abstraction aim to reduce transaction costs and improve user experience while maintaining decentralization and security. Industry observers note that while Ethereum's DeFi market share may gradually decline as capital diversifies across multiple chains, the network is likely to retain majority dominance through 2026 given its established position, developer mindshare, and institutional integration.

## Dedollarisation & US Dollar Trends

### 1. India's Forex Reserves Surge to Record $723.77 Billion Despite Rupee Hitting Historic Lows - *Jan 30*

> India's foreign exchange reserves reached an all-time high of $723.77 billion as of January 30, 2026, driven by a $10 billion RBI swap operation and gold revaluation gains, even as the rupee fell 0.4% against the dollar due to foreign fund outflows.

India's foreign exchange reserves surged to a record $723.77 billion as of January 30, 2026, marking a significant milestone as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bolstered its firepower to defend the rupee amid persistent depreciation pressure. The stockpile rose by approximately $8.05 billion to $709.4 billion in the week ended January 23, surpassing the previous high of $704.89 billion set in September 2024. In the week ended January 16, reserves jumped sharply by $14.167 billion to $701.36 billion, driven by both increased gold reserves and foreign currency assets.

Experts attributed the latest spurt in forex reserves to a $10 billion buy/sell swap the central bank conducted during the week, coupled with revaluation gains stemming from the rise in gold prices. Gold prices increased by 7.3% to $4,933 per ounce during the reported week, inflating the rupee value of India's substantial gold holdings. Despite the record reserves providing a buffer, the rupee fell 0.4% against the dollar during the week due to foreign fund outflows and delays in a trade deal between India and the United States, hitting a historic low of 85.93 in January.

The accumulation of forex reserves reflects the RBI's strategy to build defenses against external shocks, capital flight, and currency volatility, particularly as India navigates geopolitical tensions, global trade uncertainties, and domestic inflation pressures. The record reserves position India among the world's largest holders of foreign exchange, trailing only China, Japan, and Switzerland, and provide substantial capacity for the RBI to intervene in currency markets to prevent excessive rupee depreciation. However, the persistent weakness of the rupee despite record reserves highlights the structural challenges facing emerging market currencies amid dollar strength, rising U.S. interest rates, and global risk aversion.

### 2. China's Digital Yuan CIPS Settlement System Expands to ASEAN and Middle East Nations - *Feb 7*

> The People's Bank of China announced its digital RMB cross-border settlement system will be fully connected to ten ASEAN nations and six Middle Eastern countries, potentially enabling 38% of global trade to bypass SWIFT and settle in seconds rather than days.

The People's Bank of China announced in February 2026 that its digital RMB cross-border settlement system would be fully connected to the ten ASEAN nations and six Middle Eastern countries, implying that approximately 38% of global trade could potentially bypass the U.S. dollar-dominated SWIFT network and settle using China's digital currency infrastructure. Unlike SWIFT, where transactions take between 3 and 5 days and involve multiple intermediaries, China's digital currency is designed to bridge payment systems and slash processing times to mere seconds, with a pilot project between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi demonstrating a payment settling in just about seven seconds with fees dropping by 98%.

China is accelerating its long-running effort to turn the yuan into a genuine global currency, with recent signals from Washington strengthening Beijing's resolve. President Xi Jinping has placed currency strength at the center of national power, defining it in outward-looking terms: international usage, trade settlement reach, influence in foreign-exchange markets, and reserve status. China has developed alternative payment systems such as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) and the digital yuan, facilitating transactions outside traditional networks like SWIFT, with CIPS expanding rapidly to reduce dependence on SWIFT and enhance RMB liquidity.

The yuan recently achieved a landmark share of global payments, with China's yuan hitting an internationalization milestone by capturing a record share of global payment value according to SWIFT data. However, Western analysts note the yuan still accounts for a small fraction of international transactions compared to the dollar and euro, and technical connectivity does not guarantee adoption if trading partners prefer dollar liquidity and stability. The digital yuan cross-border infrastructure represents China's most ambitious challenge to dollar dominance yet, but success depends on willing adoption by trade partners, regulatory frameworks in recipient countries, and confidence in yuan stability.

### 3. Trump's Dollar Concerns Boost Xi's Global Yuan Ambitions as Renminbi Trade Settlement Accelerates - *Feb 3*

> Trump's criticism of strong dollar policy is inadvertently boosting China's yuan internationalization push, as Beijing expands yuan trade settlement mechanisms and digital RMB adoption amid U.S. currency uncertainty.

President Trump's public concerns about the strong dollar are inadvertently strengthening China's hand in promoting global yuan adoption, as Beijing seizes on U.S. currency policy uncertainty to accelerate renminbi internationalization initiatives. Trump's dollar criticism, combined with tariff threats and trade tensions, has prompted trading partners to explore alternatives to dollar-denominated transactions, creating an opening for China's yuan that Beijing is aggressively pursuing. Xi Jinping has elevated currency strength as a pillar of national power, with yuan internationalization efforts focused on increasing trade settlement reach, foreign exchange market influence, and reserve currency status.

China's yuan is gaining traction as an international trade settlement currency, with multiple nations adopting the petroyuan for energy transactions, including Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, China, UAE, and Egypt as of January 2025. The yuan recently became the world's second main currency in trade settlements via SWIFT, though still dramatically trailing the dollar and euro in total volume. The People's Bank of China does not release statistics precise enough to confirm the exact share of China-Saudi oil trade settled in RMB, but industry sources confirm the first purchase of crude oil settled in digital yuan occurred in October 2023.

The strategic context for yuan internationalization has shifted dramatically, with BRICS nations expanding yuan usage for intra-bloc trade, the digital yuan cross-border infrastructure connecting to ASEAN and Middle East countries, and China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) processing record volumes. However, fundamental challenges remain: the yuan is not freely convertible, Chinese capital controls limit liquidity, and the lack of transparent rule of law and independent central banking reduces confidence compared to dollar and euro alternatives. Trump's dollar skepticism may provide rhetorical support for yuan adoption, but structural barriers to displacing the dollar remain formidable.

### 4. Commercial Real Estate Office Sector Faces 18% CMBS Delinquency as Vacancies Persist Near 23% - *Feb 1*

> Office sector CMBS delinquency rates surged to nearly 18%, up 150 basis points year-over-year, as the commercial mortgage-backed security delinquency rate of 7.29% reaches nearly six times higher than traditional bank loans amid persistent vacancy rates near 23%.

The commercial real estate office sector faced intensifying financial stress in early 2026, with office sector delinquency rates increasing by 150 basis points over the past year to almost 18%, while the broader commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) delinquency rate reached 7.29%—nearly six times higher than traditional bank loans. Office vacancy rates closed 2025 at 18.4%, down 1.4% from 19.8% in December 2024, but many large markets continue to struggle with vacancy rates near 23%, indicating significant regional variation and persistent oversupply in major urban centers.

Moody's Analytics projects that commercial property vacancy rates will peak in 2026 at approximately 24% before beginning a gradual decline, with particular stress in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., where demand is insufficient to absorb high vacancies. Buildings with high shares of near-term lease expiries or elevated vacancies face inability to refinance as maturities approach, creating a wave of distressed asset sales and potential foreclosures. However, Moody's forecasts that a combination of continued economic growth and falling short-term interest rates will support borrowers' ability to refinance their commercial real estate loans in 2026, leading securitization performance to improve in the U.S. and Europe.

The office sector's struggles reflect structural shifts accelerated by the pandemic, including permanent remote and hybrid work arrangements that have reduced corporate space requirements, flight to quality as tenants consolidate into newer Class A buildings with modern amenities, and excess supply from the 2010s development boom that anticipated continued pre-pandemic office demand. The divergence between CMBS delinquency rates and traditional bank loan performance suggests that securitized office debt, often originated during the market peak, faces greater stress than more recent bank financing with conservative underwriting. Industry analysts anticipate office sector distress will persist through 2026, with gradual improvement dependent on demand recovery, building conversions to residential use, and the absorption of excess supply through demolitions and repurposing.

### 5. Student Loan Forgiveness Becomes Taxable as Federal Exemption Expires January 1, 2026 - *Jan 1*

> A temporary federal exemption making student loan forgiveness tax-free expired on January 1, 2026, with debt canceled under income-driven repayment plans now counting as taxable income, though Public Service Loan Forgiveness remains tax-exempt.

Student loan borrowers face a significant new financial burden in 2026 as a temporary federal exemption that made student loan forgiveness tax-free expired on January 1, 2026, with debt canceled under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans now counting as taxable income at the federal level. The change does not apply to debt canceled through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), which has always been tax-free at the federal level and remains so under current law. However, borrowers who anticipate qualifying for IDR forgiveness in 2026 should plan for a larger tax bill when filing their 2027 returns.

Federal Student Aid announced new guidance for loan servicers to move recertification dates back for those affected by the department's processing pause to at least February 2026, providing temporary relief for millions of borrowers. While IDR applications are not currently being processed, borrowers already enrolled in the plans will not see payment hikes as a result of the new guidance. Beginning July 1, 2026, the Education Department will offer a new kind of income-driven repayment plan called the repayment assistance plan, restructuring repayment options, terms for many loans, and eligibility for some post-graduate financing.

The tax treatment change affects borrowers who have been making payments under IDR plans for 20-25 years and qualify for remaining balance forgiveness, potentially creating tax bills of tens of thousands of dollars for borrowers whose forgiven amounts are treated as ordinary income. Financial advisors recommend borrowers anticipating forgiveness in 2026 begin setting aside funds for the tax liability or explore installment agreement options with the IRS. The expiration of the tax exemption represents a significant policy shift that reduces the value of income-driven repayment forgiveness and complicates financial planning for the millions of borrowers enrolled in IDR plans, potentially creating hardship for those unprepared for the tax consequences of debt cancellation.
