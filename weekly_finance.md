## Inflation & Finance Metrics

### Private Sector Hiring Plummets to 22,000 Jobs in January, Lowest Since 2009 - *Feb 4*

> ADP reported private-sector employers added just 22,000 jobs in January 2026, about half the already-weak 45,000 gain economists expected and the worst January total since the financial crisis.

The U.S. private sector labor market showed severe weakness in January, with the ADP National Employment Report revealing employers added only 22,000 jobs, falling dramatically short of the 45,000 consensus forecast. This marks the worst January performance since 2009, when the economy was in the depths of the Great Recession. The figure represents less than half the monthly average of 49,000 jobs added in 2025, which itself was down sharply from 168,000 in 2024.

Despite the dismal hiring numbers, wage growth remained surprisingly robust. Annual pay growth for workers who stayed at their jobs hit 4.5% in January, exceeding pre-pandemic levels and suggesting persistent wage pressure despite cooling labor demand. ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson noted that "the labor market is healthy but decelerating," adding that slower hiring could signal businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach amid policy uncertainty.

The weak private payroll data comes ahead of the official Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report for January, which was delayed until February 11 due to the brief government shutdown. Economists expect the BLS report to show 60,000 total nonfarm payroll gains with the unemployment rate holding at 4.4%. The divergence between weak job creation and strong wage growth presents a challenge for the Federal Reserve as it navigates its interest rate policy in 2026.

### Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.11%, Spurring Housing Market Activity Despite Flat Home Prices - *Feb 5*

> The 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped to 6.11% according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.89% a year ago, while the typical U.S. home is valued at $358,968, down 0.4% from December.

Mortgage rates continued their gradual descent in early February, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.11% on February 5, according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey. The decline from 6.89% at the same time in 2025 has provided meaningful relief to prospective homebuyers, with the typical monthly mortgage payment now 8.4% lower than a year ago. Fifteen-year fixed mortgages averaged 5.50%, also down substantially year-over-year.

The lower rates are beginning to stimulate housing market activity, with nationwide inventory reaching 1.11 million homes in January, 6% higher than the same time last year. The Zillow Home Value Index showed the typical U.S. home valued at $358,968, declining 0.4% from December to January, though values remain 0.2% above year-ago levels. Forecasters predict modest price movements in 2026, with Redfin expecting a 1% year-over-year increase in the median home-sale price, while J.P. Morgan projects 0% national price growth.

Industry analysts expect mortgage rates to remain largely unchanged throughout February, as persistently higher-than-desired inflation continues to offset a slowly weakening yet still resilient labor market. The National Association of Realtors notes that while affordability has improved from 2024's peak pain, housing remains expensive by historical standards. Competition for homes has remained subdued compared to the frenzied markets of 2021-2022, with U.S. home inventory, prices, and sales slowly stabilizing into what some analysts are calling "The Great Housing Reset."

### Tariff-Driven Inflation Forecast to Reach 2.7% in 2026 as Business Inventory Buffers Deplete - *Feb 3*

> Businesses are shifting from absorbing 80% of tariff costs in 2025 to passing 70% directly to consumers in 2026, with inflation expected to climb to 2.7% as pretariff inventory runs out.

U.S. inflation is forecast to rise to 2.7% in 2026 as businesses increasingly pass tariff costs along to consumers, according to analysis from Morningstar, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs. The anticipated inflation acceleration represents a sharp reversal from the disinflationary trend of late 2024 and early 2025, driven by the depletion of pretariff inventory and the implementation of President Trump's expanded tariff regime.

The mechanics of this shift are stark: in 2025, businesses absorbed roughly 80% of tariff costs, protecting consumers from the full price impact. Goldman Sachs analysis shows that share has already flipped, with businesses now shouldering just 55% of tariff costs and consumers bearing 45%. By later in 2026, economists project the consumer share could reach 70% as inventory stockpiles run out and businesses renegotiate contracts. Goldman Sachs estimates tariffs caused inflation to increase by half a percentage point in 2025, but some analysts warn inflation could exceed 4% by the end of 2026.

Category-specific projections show durables prices rising a cumulative 4.5% over 2025-27 and nondurables climbing 5.6%, with grocers—operating on thin profit margins—having less ability to absorb tariffs than other sectors. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tariff increases implemented in 2025 will reduce GDP by 0.5% and increase consumer prices by 1.5% through 2027. The Peterson Institute for International Economics projects that tariffs represent an income loss of $1,700 for the average U.S. household, hitting lower-income families the hardest as a percentage of their income.

### Housing Market Enters "Great Reset" as Inventory Rises 6% and Price Growth Stalls - *Feb 1*

> U.S. housing inventory climbed to 1.11 million homes in January, up 6% year-over-year, while median home prices are forecast to rise just 1% in 2026 as affordability constraints persist.

The U.S. housing market is undergoing what Redfin calls "The Great Housing Reset," with rising inventory, stagnant prices, and subdued competition marking a dramatic shift from the frenzied markets of the pandemic era. Nationwide housing inventory reached 1.11 million homes in January 2026, representing a 6% increase from the same time last year and the highest level since early 2022. The increase in supply comes as sellers, particularly those who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during 2020-2021, slowly return to the market.

Price dynamics reflect this normalization, with major forecasters projecting minimal appreciation in 2026. Redfin expects the median U.S. home-sale price to rise just 1% year over year, while J.P. Morgan projects 0% national price growth. Zillow's data shows the typical U.S. home valued at $358,968, down 0.4% from December but up 0.2% year-over-year—essentially flat when adjusted for inflation. The moderation in prices comes despite mortgage rates falling from their 2024 peaks, with the 30-year fixed rate at 6.11% in early February.

Affordability remains the central challenge facing the housing market. The National Association of Realtors reports that the typical monthly mortgage payment is 8.4% lower than a year ago, yet housing costs still consume a historically high share of median household income. Competition for homes has remained subdued, with fewer bidding wars and properties sitting on the market longer than during the 2020-2022 boom. Industry analysts anticipate gradual housing market improvement throughout 2026, with steady mortgage rates and slowly stabilizing inventory, prices, and sales, but warn that structural housing supply shortages will prevent a return to pre-pandemic affordability levels.

### January CPI Report Scheduled for February 13 as Core Inflation Holds Above Fed Target - *Feb 8*

> The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release January 2026 Consumer Price Index data on February 13, with core PCE remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target at 2.8% as of November 2025.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the Consumer Price Index for January 2026 on February 13 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time, providing the first comprehensive inflation reading of the new year. As of the most recent data available, PCE inflation stood at 2.8% in November 2025, exceeding the Federal Reserve's 2% target, while headline CPI for December showed a 2.7% year-over-year increase with core CPI at 2.6%.

Federal Reserve officials have expressed cautious optimism about the inflation trajectory while acknowledging persistent price pressures. In a January 30 speech, Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman noted that based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12-month core PCE inflation likely stood at or slightly below 3% in December, up somewhat since September. However, she pointed to alternative measures from the Dallas and Cleveland Fed suggesting that underlying inflation has continued to decline when adjusted for volatile categories.

The Cleveland Fed's Inflation Nowcasting model, which provides real-time estimates between official releases, shows inflation running close to but still above target. Market participants are particularly focused on the January CPI report as it will reveal whether tariff-driven price increases are beginning to materialize in headline figures. Economists warn that as pretariff inventory depletes and businesses pass costs to consumers, inflation could accelerate through the first half of 2026. The upcoming PCE price indices for December are scheduled for release on February 20, providing the Fed's preferred inflation metric just weeks before the March FOMC meeting.

## Crypto Market Developments

### SEC Dismisses Coinbase Lawsuit with Prejudice, Marking Historic Regulatory Shift - *Feb 6*

> The Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed its 2023 lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice, allowing the exchange to retain its business model and listings without fines in what marks the end of the Gensler-era enforcement approach.

The Securities and Exchange Commission formally dismissed its high-profile lawsuit against Coinbase on February 6, 2026, marking a historic turning point in crypto regulation and the definitive end of the aggressive enforcement strategy that defined the Gary Gensler era. The dismissal came with prejudice, meaning the SEC cannot refile identical charges, and Coinbase retained its existing business model, token listings, and staking services with no fines or remediation requirements.

The lawsuit, originally filed in June 2023, accused Coinbase of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency by listing tokens the SEC deemed to be securities. The case became a centerpiece of the regulatory battle over whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities, with billions of dollars in market value and the future structure of the U.S. crypto industry hanging in the balance. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who replaced Gensler in April 2025, signaled the regulatory pivot shortly after taking office.

Legal experts characterize the dismissal as a watershed moment for the crypto industry, providing clarity that exchanges can list digital assets without automatically triggering securities laws. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that "this outcome validates what we've said all along—that most digital assets are not securities and that innovation in America shouldn't be stifled by regulatory overreach." The dismissal follows a similar 60-day stay on the SEC's case against Binance, which is expected to result in a permanent settlement. The new regulatory approach focuses on enablement rather than enforcement, with the SEC now pursuing a "token taxonomy" framework and an "innovation exemption" to fast-track crypto products.

### Spot XRP and Solana ETFs Launch as Congress Clears Path for Altcoin Approvals - *Feb 3*

> Spot XRP exchange-traded funds began trading in the U.S. with $1.37 billion in collective AUM, while a House vote restored government operations and unlocked the path for Solana and Cardano S-1 approvals by mid-February.

U.S. spot XRP exchange-traded funds debuted in early February 2026, with Canary Capital's XRPC on Nasdaq and Grayscale's GXRP on NYSE Arca leading the launch. The funds collectively reached $1.37 billion in assets under management within days of trading, demonstrating significant institutional demand for altcoin exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The launches followed the SEC's September 2025 approval of generic listing standards that allowed exchanges to fast-track crypto ETF applications.

The House of Representatives vote on February 3 to restore government operations after the brief shutdown also unlocked the regulatory pathway for the next batch of altcoin ETF approvals. Industry sources indicate that Solana and Cardano S-1 filings could receive approval by mid-February, with spot Avalanche and Polkadot ETFs likely to follow in subsequent months. Galaxy Research analyst Jianing Wu projects more than 100 spot altcoin, multi-asset, and leveraged crypto ETFs launching in 2026, with net inflows exceeding $50 billion.

The ETF flow data for February 3 showed institutional rotation across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, with spot Bitcoin ETF assets stabilizing at $60.03 billion in net assets after January's brutal $1.6 billion outflow month. Market structure is evolving rapidly, with at least 125 filings awaiting SEC approval as of December 17, 2025. Morgan Stanley filed for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs in early January, deepening Wall Street's crypto push. The proliferation of crypto ETFs represents the "democratization of digital assets," allowing retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to crypto without directly holding tokens, custody keys, or navigating unregulated exchanges.

### Crypto Mining Faces Mandatory ESG Disclosure Under MiCA and UAE Regulations - *Feb 5*

> By February 2026, cryptocurrency mining operations in the EU and UAE must comply with mandatory ESG reporting requirements, disclosing energy consumption, emissions, and sustainability plans as compliance shifts from voluntary to required.

Cryptocurrency mining operations and crypto companies in the European Union and United Arab Emirates now face mandatory environmental, social, and governance disclosure requirements under the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and new UAE licensing frameworks. The regulations, which came into full effect in February 2026, require exchanges, custodians, DeFi platforms, stablecoin issuers, and mining operations to disclose comprehensive ESG metrics as part of licensing and continuing compliance obligations.

Under MiCA and parallel UAE regulations, companies must submit detailed information on energy consumption, carbon emissions, energy source mix, and plans to reduce environmental harm. Mining operations must clarify the power sources in their energy mix, quantify greenhouse gas emissions, and provide credible pathways to sustainability. The shift represents a fundamental change from voluntary ESG initiatives to mandatory compliance requirements for cryptocurrency companies seeking institutional investment, banking partnerships, and public market listings.

The International Monetary Fund has proposed a carbon tax of up to $0.09 per kilowatt-hour for crypto miners, which if implemented could raise $5 billion annually while cutting up to 100 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. Local environmental agencies in the EU are enforcing stricter guidelines requiring miners to adhere to sustainability practices and reduce carbon footprints. ESG compliance in 2026 has become a prerequisite for cryptocurrency operations, with regulators scrutinizing energy consumption data as part of routine audits. Industry analysts note that mining operations relying on renewable energy sources are positioned to gain competitive advantages as ESG standards tighten globally, while coal-powered operations face mounting regulatory and reputational risks.

### CIPS Cross-Border Payment System Volume Surges 43% to $24.45 Trillion Annually - *Feb 7*

> China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System processed ¥175.49 trillion ($24.45 trillion) in 2024, up 43% year-over-year, as the yuan-based payment infrastructure expanded to six Middle East and Africa banks.

China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) processed record transaction volumes in 2024, with total annual volume rising 43% to ¥175.49 trillion ($24.45 trillion), driven by a 24% increase in transaction count to 8.2 million. The growth represents more than a tripling of both volume and transaction numbers since 2020, signaling accelerating adoption of yuan-denominated cross-border payments as an alternative to dollar-based settlement systems.

CIPS, launched in 2015 under the authorization and oversight of the People's Bank of China, serves as China's onshore payment infrastructure for clearing and settling cross-border transactions in Chinese yuan. In June 2025, CIPS forged its first direct partnerships with six foreign banks in the Middle East and Africa, expanding the system's global reach beyond its primarily Asian user base. The Shanghai municipal government, working with the PBOC and financial regulators, released a joint plan in late 2025 to promote yuan usage in trade with Global South countries, with Shanghai "enhancing the functionality" of CIPS and continuing to expand global network coverage.

Industry observers note that CIPS serves a fundamentally different function than SWIFT, which is a global messaging network rather than a clearing and settlement system. SWIFT and CIPS signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on improving capabilities, with SWIFT viewing CIPS as a partner rather than rival. The organization plans to expand participation in 2026 to all member institutions, including banks, payment institutions, and major local e-wallets. The growth of CIPS reflects China's broader strategy to internationalize the yuan and reduce reliance on dollar-denominated payment channels, though analysts note the dollar still dominates global reserves and most international trade settlement.

### Crypto ETF Approvals Accelerate with 125 Filings Pending and Cardano Launch Expected Mid-February - *Feb 4*

> At least 125 crypto ETF applications await SEC approval as of mid-December, with spot Cardano ETFs expected to launch by mid-February following generic listing standards approved in September 2025.

The cryptocurrency ETF landscape is experiencing explosive growth, with at least 125 applications pending SEC approval as of December 17, 2025, and industry analysts projecting over 100 spot altcoin, multi-asset, and leveraged crypto ETFs launching in 2026. The surge in filings follows the SEC's September 2025 approval of generic listing standards, which created a streamlined pathway for exchanges to list crypto products without requiring individual SEC approval for each token.

Spot Cardano (ADA) ETFs are expected to receive S-1 approval by mid-February, following the successful launches of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP exchange-traded funds. The House vote on February 3 restored government operations and cleared regulatory roadblocks that had delayed the next wave of approvals. Galaxy Research projects net inflows to crypto ETFs exceeding $50 billion in 2026, driven by institutional investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets without the operational complexity of direct token ownership.

Major financial institutions have deepened their crypto commitments, with Morgan Stanley filing for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs in early January 2026. Less than two years since the SEC approved the first spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, 39 funds tracking digital assets have launched in the U.S., ranging from spot Ethereum, Solana, and XRP products to index funds tracking niche altcoins. The rapid expansion represents what Grayscale calls the "Dawn of the Institutional Era," as crypto integrates into traditional finance systems through regulated investment vehicles. Analysts predict approvals for Avalanche and Polkadot ETFs in subsequent months, with the crypto industry transitioning from hype-driven cycles to institutional adoption and regulatory clarity.

## Dedollarisation & US Dollar Trends

### US Dollar Share of Global Reserves Falls to 56.9%, Lowest Since 1994 - *Feb 6*

> Central bank reserve holdings of USD-denominated assets dropped to 56.9% in Q3 2025, down from 64.69% in Q1 2017, as foreign central banks diversified into smaller currencies while the dollar's unadjusted share hit a 31-year low.

The U.S. dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves fell to 56.9% in the third quarter of 2025, marking the lowest level since 1994 and continuing a two-decade trend of gradual diversification away from dollar dominance. IMF data shows the dollar's share has declined from 64.69% in Q1 2017 to 57.74% in Q1 2025, accelerating the downward trajectory that began in the early 2000s when the dollar accounted for over 70% of global reserves.

However, when adjusted for exchange rate changes, the picture becomes more nuanced. The IMF notes that the dollar share of central bank reserve holdings has not declined to the extent that unadjusted figures signal. Foreign central banks added modestly to their dollar-denominated holdings in recent quarters, but they added more assets denominated in other currencies—particularly a "gaggle of smaller currencies" whose combined share has surged. The euro, yen, and pound sterling have not proportionally gained what the dollar has lost, suggesting diversification rather than a wholesale shift to rival reserve currencies.

Geopolitical factors are accelerating this trend. The IMF estimates that 30-40 non-aligned nations hold more than 10% of reserves in dollar-denominated assets while simultaneously facing or fearing U.S. sanctions exposure, creating structural pressure for diversification. Financial experts largely agree that the dollar's strength and stability will sustain its role as the world's primary reserve currency in the near term, but the long-term trajectory shows unmistakable erosion of dollar dominance as central banks seek to reduce concentration risk and geopolitical vulnerability.

### India Assumes BRICS Presidency as Bloc Launches BRICS Pay, "The Unit" Pilots - *Feb 5*

> India takes over the BRICS presidency with the de-dollarization agenda transitioning from planning to implementation, including the BRICS Pay expansion that has reduced USD usage in intra-bloc trade by roughly two-thirds.

India assumed the BRICS presidency in early 2026, with the de-dollarization agenda entering a critical implementation phase after years of planning and pilot programs. The BRICS Pay payment system expansion has already reduced U.S. dollar usage in intra-bloc trade by approximately two-thirds, while "The Unit"—a new settlement currency backed by 40% gold and 60% BRICS national currencies—launched its pilot program on October 31, 2025, with testing underway across member nations.

India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has sought to moderate expectations, stating in March 2025 that "I don't think there's any policy on our part to replace the dollar. The dollar as the reserve currency is the source of global economic stability." This measured approach reflects India's delicate balancing act between BRICS de-dollarization initiatives and its significant economic ties with the United States and Western institutions. India will host the 18th BRICS Summit in New Delhi, likely in August or September, where these currency initiatives will face critical scrutiny.

Russia, China, and India are collaborating to interlink their digital currency systems—the digital ruble, yuan, and rupee—creating an alternative settlement infrastructure for cross-border trade. The 126-point Rio de Janeiro BRICS leaders' declaration from 2025 notably omitted the term "de-dollarisation" and made no explicit mention of initiatives to lessen the dollar's role, reflecting internal divisions within the bloc. Despite these challenges, BRICS member nations are reducing dollar reliance through local currency settlements and alternative payment systems, with the dollar's share in intra-BRICS trade declining significantly over the past three years.

### Saudi Arabia-China Currency Swap and mBridge Platform Enable Yuan Oil Settlement - *Feb 8*

> China and Saudi Arabia signed a $7 billion currency swap agreement enabling direct yuan-riyal settlement without dollar intermediation, while Saudi Arabia's central bank joined the BIS Project mBridge for digital yuan cross-border payments.

China and Saudi Arabia signed a $7 billion currency swap agreement in late 2025, enabling direct settlement between the Chinese yuan (CNY) and Saudi riyal (SAR) and allowing bilateral trade to be conducted without using the U.S. dollar as an intermediary currency. The agreement represents the most concrete step yet in the gradual shift toward yuan-denominated energy trade, though Saudi oil exports remain predominantly settled in USD by default, preserving petrodollar demand.

In June 2024, Saudi Arabia's central bank joined the Bank for International Settlements-led Project mBridge alongside China, Hong Kong, UAE, and Thailand. The mBridge platform uses the digital yuan for cross-border payments, potentially allowing oil transactions to be conducted outside the SWIFT network. The development comes after years of intermittent discussions between China and Saudi Arabia about pricing oil sales in yuan, with negotiations reportedly intensifying in 2022 when China purchased a quarter of Saudi Arabia's oil exports.

However, a complete replacement of the U.S. dollar in energy markets remains unlikely in the near future. Saudi oil exports are still settled in USD by default, and industry analysts suggest a gradual diversification toward a multipolar currency system—where oil and gas transactions are conducted in numerous major currencies rather than one—is more probable than a wholesale shift to the yuan. Modern Diplomacy characterizes the developments as "the rise of the petroyuan," though experts note that the dollar's liquidity, stability, and deep financial markets continue to make it the preferred currency for most international energy transactions. The yuan-riyal swap and mBridge participation provide optionality for Saudi Arabia to reduce dollar exposure incrementally rather than replace the petrodollar system entirely.

### Gold Prices Forecast to Reach $4,900-$6,000 in 2026 Amid Central Bank Buying Surge - *Feb 7*

> Goldman Sachs projects gold reaching $4,900 per ounce by December 2026, while Bank of America and J.P. Morgan see a clear path to $5,000, and Yardeni Research predicts $6,000 as central banks accelerate reserve diversification.

Gold prices are forecast to reach unprecedented levels in 2026, with major investment banks projecting prices clustering around $4,500-$4,700 and upside potential toward $5,000-$6,000 if macroeconomic conditions persist. Goldman Sachs projects gold reaching $4,900 per ounce by December 2026, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan see a clear path to $5,000, and Yardeni Research predicts $6,000 by year-end. Gold posted continuous gains in 2025, climbing as much as 55% and surpassing $4,000 per ounce for the first time in October.

Central bank buying represents the primary structural driver behind gold's rally, with foreign central banks—particularly those in emerging markets and non-aligned nations—accelerating gold purchases as part of reserve diversification strategies. The shift away from dollar-heavy reserves has intensified as geopolitical tensions and sanctions risks prompt countries to seek non-dollar stores of value. The World Gold Council reports that central bank net purchases remained elevated through 2025, with particular strength from China, Russia, India, and Middle Eastern monetary authorities.

The U.S. macroeconomic backdrop supports continued gold strength in 2026, with elevated government spending, persistent inflation pockets, and real yields drifting lower. A softer U.S. dollar adds further support, with the same fundamental conditions that drove gold through the past two years remaining intact. CME Group's Precious Metals Outlook 2026 notes that market dynamics following a record-breaking year suggest sustained institutional demand, safe-haven flows during periods of geopolitical uncertainty, and technical momentum as gold enters price-discovery territory above $4,000. Sprott Asset Management characterizes the current environment as "gold's steady climb" supported by structural factors rather than speculative excess, suggesting the rally has room to extend through 2026.

### BRICS Currencies Collapse Despite De-Dollarization Push as Dollar Strengthens - *Feb 2*

> The U.S. dollar reached new highs while BRICS currencies plummeted, with the Indian rupee hitting a historic low of 85.93 and the Chinese yuan weakening sharply, undermining the bloc's de-dollarization agenda.

BRICS nations' de-dollarization ambitions faced a harsh reality check in early 2026 as member currencies collapsed while the U.S. dollar reached new highs, demonstrating the persistent strength of dollar dominance despite efforts to reduce reliance on the greenback. The Indian rupee plummeted to a historic low of 85.93 against the dollar in January, while the Chinese yuan weakened significantly, erasing gains from earlier in 2025. The divergence between BRICS rhetoric and market reality highlights the structural challenges facing alternatives to the dollar system.

Financial markets continue to favor the American currency despite the BRICS bloc's efforts to limit dollar exposure through local currency settlements, alternative payment systems, and the nascent BRICS Pay platform. The strength of the dollar reflects fundamental factors including higher U.S. interest rates, robust economic growth relative to other major economies, and the unmatched liquidity and stability of dollar-denominated assets. Currency analysts note that despite BRICS initiatives, the dollar's reserve currency status remains the source of global economic stability, as Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar acknowledged.

The currency weakness within BRICS creates internal tensions for the de-dollarization agenda, as countries grappling with depreciating currencies face pressure to maintain dollar reserves and dollar-denominated trade invoicing for stability. The Lowy Institute characterizes the situation as "shifting power between the US and BRICS," with de-dollarization remaining a long-term strategic goal that faces significant near-term headwinds. Analysts suggest that while BRICS will continue exploring alternatives like local currency settlements and blockchain-based payment systems, the persistent dollar strength and BRICS currency weakness demonstrate that displacing the dollar from its central role in global finance remains extraordinarily difficult absent a major U.S. economic or financial crisis.
