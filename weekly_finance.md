## Inflation & Finance Metrics

### 1. January CPI Inflation Falls to 2.4%, Lowest Level Since May, as Energy Prices Drop - *Feb 13*

> The Consumer Price Index increased just 2.4% year-over-year in January 2026, down from 2.7% in December, driven by a 0.1% decline in energy prices as gasoline fell 7.5%, while core inflation eased to 2.5%, the lowest since April 2021.

The annual inflation rate in the United States slowed to 2.4% in January 2026, marking the lowest level since May and providing relief for consumers and policymakers as price pressures continued to moderate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on February 13, 2026 that the Consumer Price Index increased just 0.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis in January, with energy prices falling 1.5% and gasoline prices plunging 7.5% compared to a 3.4% decline in December. The shelter index, which has been the primary driver of inflation persistence, rose a modest 0.2% in January and was the largest factor in the monthly increase.

Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy components, eased to 2.5% year-over-year, down from 2.6% in December and marking the lowest reading since April 2021. The food index increased 0.2% over the month, matching the food at home index increase, while the food away from home index rose just 0.1%, suggesting restaurant price pressures are moderating. The cooler-than-expected inflation data immediately boosted expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2026, with futures markets pricing in increased probability of monetary easing by mid-year.

However, inflation concerns persist as businesses prepare to pass tariff costs to consumers in coming months. Fed Chair Powell noted that he expects a one-time increase in consumer prices to work its way through the economy by the middle of 2026, with tariff-driven inflation expected to top out in the middle quarters of the year. Goldman Sachs anticipates inflation will increase by three-tenths of a percentage point in just the first six months of 2026, while JPMorgan projects that businesses could shift tariff absorption from 80% in 2025 to just 20% in 2026, dramatically increasing consumer price impacts.

### 2. Retail Sales Stagnate at 0.0% in December as Consumer Confidence Plunges to Decade Low - *Feb 10*

> December 2025 retail sales were completely flat at 0.0%, significantly underperforming expectations of 0.4%, while core retail sales fell 0.1%, as consumer confidence plummeted from 94.2 to 84.5 in January 2026, the lowest level in over a decade.

American consumer spending showed alarming weakness in December 2025, with retail sales completely flat at 0.0% according to Commerce Department data released February 10, 2026, significantly underperforming economist expectations of 0.4% growth. Core retail sales, which exclude volatile categories like autos and gasoline, fell 0.1% in December, well below the 0.4% advance economists had predicted, signaling a broad-based slowdown in consumer discretionary spending as Americans grow increasingly cautious about economic conditions.

The retail sales stagnation reflects a dramatic deterioration in consumer confidence, with the Conference Board's sentiment index plummeting from 94.2 in December to 84.5 in January 2026, marking the lowest level in over a decade. Consumers cited a "triple threat" of high tariffs expected to raise prices, persistent inflation eroding purchasing power, and a softening labor market creating job insecurity. The wage growth slowdown compounds these concerns, with the Employment Cost Index rising only 0.7% during the last three months of 2025, the weakest pace in more than four years.

Consumer spending divergence by income bracket intensified throughout 2025, creating a pronounced K-shaped economy where higher-income households maintain spending while middle- and lower-income Americans pull back sharply. Retailers focused on value and low prices like Walmart and TJX have significantly outperformed the S&P 500, while discretionary-heavy stores like Target struggle with declining traffic and margin compression. Executives during Q4 earnings calls offered conservative guidance for 2026, warning of aggressive promotional activity throughout the first quarter as companies clear excess inventory, which threatens to erode profit margins across the retail sector.

### 3. Tariffs Reach Highest Levels Since 1946 as Weighted Average Rate Hits 13.5% - *Feb 6*

> U.S. tariffs reached their highest levels since 1946 as of February 6, 2026, with the weighted average applied tariff rate on all imports rising to 13.5% and an effective tariff rate of 9.9%, representing the largest tax increase as a percent of GDP (0.54%) since 1993.

Trump administration tariffs have reached historic levels, with the weighted average applied tariff rate on all imports surging to 13.5% as of February 6, 2026, the highest since 1946, while the average effective tariff rate reached 9.9%, according to analysis from the Yale Budget Lab and Tax Foundation. The tariff increases represent the largest U.S. tax increase as a percentage of GDP (0.54 percent for 2026) since 1993, imposing substantial costs on American businesses and consumers as the economy faces multiple headwinds.

The inflation outlook for 2026 reflects growing concerns about tariff pass-through to consumers, with businesses beginning to shift cost burden after absorbing the majority of tariff impacts in 2025. JPMorgan estimates that businesses absorbed roughly 80% of the tariff bill in 2025, but that percentage could shrink to just 20% in 2026 as companies exhaust their ability to compress margins and must raise prices to maintain profitability. Research from the Budget Lab shows that over the June-August 2025 period, tariffs explained roughly 0.5 percentage points of headline PCE annualized inflation and around 0.4 percentage points of core PCE annualized inflation.

Economic growth projections have been revised downward, with estimates suggesting the imposed tariffs will reduce U.S. GDP by 0.5 percent before accounting for foreign retaliation. Looking specifically at calendar year 2026, accounting for all 2025 U.S. tariffs and retaliation implemented to date, real GDP growth is estimated to be 0.1 percentage points lower. Consumer prices for specific goods face substantial increases, with durables prices expected to rise a cumulative 4.5% over 2025-27, nondurables to rise 5.6%, and motor vehicle prices projected to increase by 8.4% under all tariff actions—the equivalent of an additional $4,000 to the price of an average 2024 new car.

### 4. Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.09% as Housing Market Shows Signs of Rebound - *Feb 12*

> The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage slipped to 6.09% in the week ending February 12, down from 6.11% the previous week, as the housing market shows signs of rebalance with monthly payments expected to decline for the first time since 2020.

Mortgage rates edged lower in mid-February 2026, with the average for 30-year fixed loans falling to 6.09%, down from 6.11% the previous week according to Freddie Mac data released February 12, providing marginal relief to prospective homebuyers after rates peaked near 7% a year ago. The modest decline reflects cooling inflation data and Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, though rates remain largely unchanged from early February levels as persistently higher-than-desired inflation continues to be offset by a slowly weakening yet still resilient labor market.

Despite the modest improvement in rates, housing demand has remained sluggish even as borrowing costs dropped from nearly 7% a year ago, reflecting fundamental affordability challenges that persist across most major markets. However, the housing market is showing signs of a rebalance and potential rebound in 2026, with monthly payments expected to decline for the first time since 2020 as mortgage rates trend lower and home price growth moderates to approximately 2% for the full year. Affordability is improving because those monthly payments are shrinking and incomes are also expected to grow, providing incremental relief to buyers locked out during the 2021-2023 price surge.

Major financial institutions project that mortgage rates are expected to remain largely unchanged throughout February, with the full-year 2026 outlook suggesting rates will stay rangebound between approximately 5.75% and 6.5% depending on inflation trends and Federal Reserve policy decisions. The rate environment creates a complex dynamic where potential sellers remain "locked in" to sub-4% mortgages obtained during the pandemic era, constraining inventory and limiting home sales volume even as prices stabilize and affordability marginally improves for those able to navigate the high-rate environment.

### 5. Jobless Claims Fall to 227,000 as Labor Market Stabilizes Despite Weak Job Growth - *Feb 12*

> Initial jobless claims decreased to 227,000 in the week ending February 7, down 5,000 from the previous week, while continuing claims rose to 1.862 million, reflecting a low-firing, low-hiring labor market that added just 130,000 jobs in January.

The labor market showed signs of stabilization in early February 2026, with initial jobless claims falling to 227,000 in the week ending February 7, a decrease of 5,000 from the previous week's revised level, though slightly above the Dow Jones estimate of 225,000. The modest decline in new claims suggests employers are not engaging in mass layoffs despite economic uncertainty and tariff headwinds, maintaining a low-firing environment even as hiring has slowed substantially from 2021-2022 peak levels.

However, continuing claims—the number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid—increased 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.862 million during the week ended January 31, suggesting unemployed workers are taking longer to find new positions. The rise in continuing claims was partially attributed to business disruptions following a series of winter storms across multiple parts of the country, though the underlying trend points to reduced labor market dynamism with fewer job openings and longer unemployment durations.

The January employment situation report revealed a labor market that is stabilizing but far weaker beneath the surface than headline figures suggest. Employers added a healthy 130,000 jobs in January with the unemployment rate falling to 4.3%, but revisions showed job growth averaged only about 15,000 per month throughout 2025 after adjustments. Service sectors like finance and professional services that normally power the creation of high-paying office positions have been shedding jobs, perhaps reflecting employers' anticipation of AI-related cost savings and productivity enhancements that reduce headcount requirements while maintaining or increasing output.

## Crypto Market Developments

### 1. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Record Continued Outflows as Institutional Momentum Pauses - *Feb 4*

> U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $272 million in net outflows on February 3 as Bitcoin fluctuated between $73,000 and $76,000, while Ethereum ETFs posted $14 million in inflows, signaling the first weekly period without net inflows since mid-January.

U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds experienced approximately $272 million in net outflows on February 3, 2026, even as Bitcoin's price swung sharply between roughly $73,000 and $76,000, according to data compiled by industry trackers. Fidelity Investments' FBTC led the exodus with $148.7 million in outflows, followed by Ark Invest's ARKB with $62.5 million in redemptions and a combined $90.4 million from Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin funds. BlackRock's IBIT was the only major fund to see inflows on the day, adding about $60 million, demonstrating the bifurcated nature of institutional sentiment.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have not recorded a weekly net inflow since mid-January 2026, marking a notable pause in institutional momentum after the explosive growth of 2025 when Bitcoin ETF inflows totaled $23 billion. Bitcoin ETF assets have fallen sharply from near $115 billion to approximately $83 billion, while Ethereum ETFs have seen an even steeper contraction, dropping from around $18 billion to $11 billion. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields has been identified as a central factor in the capital outflow, as the risk-free rate approaches levels that make fixed income more competitive with volatile crypto assets.

However, capital rotation rather than wholesale exit from crypto appears to be the dominant dynamic. While Bitcoin faced outflows on February 3, spot ether ETFs posted net inflows of about $14 million on the same day, while XRP-focused products attracted nearly $20 million, suggesting some investors are rotating exposure rather than exiting crypto markets outright. The divergence points to selective positioning as investors reassess relative value across crypto assets amid evolving regulatory frameworks, with newly approved altcoin ETFs capturing flows that previously would have concentrated exclusively in Bitcoin products.

### 2. Stablecoin Regulation Intensifies as New York Prosecutors Challenge GENIUS Act Framework - *Feb 3*

> New York Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan's Alvin Bragg, alleged the GENIUS Act fails to provide comprehensive anti-fraud measures and criticized Circle and Tether for profiting $1 billion each from frozen funds in 2024.

The stablecoin regulatory landscape intensified in early February 2026 as New York's top prosecutors mounted a significant challenge to the federal GENIUS Act framework, alleging that the landmark stablecoin law fails to provide comprehensive anti-fraud measures and creates legal cover for issuers to profit from stolen funds. Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan's Alvin Bragg, specifically targeted both Circle and Tether, estimating that each company made $1 billion in profits during 2024 from investing reserve funds backing stolen and frozen stablecoins, with Circle holding more than $114 million in frozen funds as of November.

The prosecutors take issue with what the GENIUS Act lacks—namely, language that would compel companies to return stolen funds to victims of fraud rather than allowing issuers to keep and invest those assets indefinitely. Under current GENIUS Act provisions, supervisory agencies must publish implementing rules for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issuers by July 18, 2026, with regulations taking effect six months later by January 18, 2027 at the latest. The implementation process has already become contentious, with banks demanding that regulators close a "loophole" that allows stablecoin issuers to offer yield, a feature banks fear will undermine their deposit base and competitive positioning.

Amid the regulatory controversy, Tether launched USAT, a dollar-backed token issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, representing Tether's first product specifically designed to operate within the U.S. federal stablecoin framework established under the GENIUS Act. The move signals Tether's attempt to address long-standing regulatory criticism and capture institutional capital that has increasingly favored Circle's USDC due to compliance and transparency concerns. The regulatory battle over frozen funds, yield restrictions, and fraud remediation will likely shape the final implementing regulations due in July, with significant implications for the competitive dynamics of the $308 billion stablecoin market.

### 3. ETHDenver 2026 Draws SEC Officials as Regulatory Engagement Marks Shift from Enforcement to Collaboration - *Feb 17-21*

> ETHDenver 2026 runs February 17-21 with expected attendance of 18,000+, featuring SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and White House officials, reflecting a broader shift in how regulators view the Ethereum ecosystem after years of adversarial enforcement.

ETHDenver 2026, the world's largest Ethereum-focused conference and hackathon, takes place February 17-21 at Denver's Stockyards Event Center with expected attendance exceeding 18,000 developers, investors, and policymakers. The event marks a watershed moment in crypto-government relations, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, White House representatives, and other federal officials scheduled to attend, reflecting a fundamental shift from avoidance and adversarial enforcement to direct engagement with the Ethereum development community.

The regulatory presence at ETHDenver signals the impact of leadership changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission following the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and the passage of the GENIUS Act, which transitioned the United States from a regime of regulation by enforcement to purpose-built legislative frameworks providing clear compliance pathways. SEC Chair Atkins has announced plans for a "token taxonomy" to delineate which cryptocurrencies would be classified as securities, embarked on "Project Crypto" to update the SEC's rules around digital assets, and is pushing an "innovation exemption" to fast-track crypto products through the approval process.

The conference programming spans core Ethereum infrastructure, Layer-2 scaling solutions, DeFi protocols, stablecoins, privacy technologies, and governance mechanisms, with one of the world's largest Ethereum hackathons bringing together thousands of developers shipping real prototypes. Industry analysts expect Congress to pass bipartisan crypto market structure legislation in 2026, which will likely cement blockchain-based finance in U.S. capital markets and facilitate continued institutional investment. The shift from regulatory hostility to constructive engagement at events like ETHDenver represents a dramatic reversal that could unlock substantial innovation and capital formation across the blockchain sector.

### 4. Grayscale Files for Spot AAVE ETF as Altcoin ETF Pipeline Expands Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum - *Feb 11*

> Grayscale Investments submitted an S-1 filing to launch a spot AAVE ETF, joining a pipeline of more than 92 crypto ETFs awaiting SEC approval, with Galaxy Research projecting more than 100 altcoin, multi-asset, and leveraged crypto ETFs launching in 2026.

Grayscale Investments submitted an S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot AAVE ETF, marking a major step toward bringing decentralized finance protocols into traditional markets and signaling that the ETF race is expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The filing represents the first attempt to create a U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking a DeFi governance token, potentially giving retail investors easier access to decentralized finance through standard brokerage accounts without the complexity of wallet management, private keys, and blockchain transactions.

The Grayscale AAVE filing is part of a massive expansion of the crypto ETF landscape, with approximately 92 crypto ETFs now awaiting SEC approval according to industry trackers. Galaxy Research projects more than 100 spot altcoin, multi-asset, and leveraged crypto ETFs launching in 2026, with net inflows projected to exceed $50 billion—more than doubling 2025 inflows. The SEC has already approved the listing and trading of several multi-asset products, including the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which combines Bitcoin and Ethereum with allocations to Solana, Cardano, and XRP.

XRP ETFs have emerged as early success stories among altcoin products, attracting $1.37 billion in assets under management in under 60 days with 43 consecutive days of positive inflows following Ripple's improved legal outlook. Bitwise has filed for 11 crypto strategy ETFs covering tokens including AAVE, UNI, and ZEC, while multiple issuers have submitted applications for Solana, Cardano, and other Layer-1 platform tokens. The rapid expansion of crypto ETF offerings reflects both regulatory clarity under the new SEC leadership and institutional demand for diversified exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, with traditional finance infrastructure increasingly accommodating blockchain assets.

### 5. Bitcoin Trades Near $68,900 as Mining Sustainability Concerns Intensify Post-Halving - *Feb 14*

> Bitcoin closed at $68,900 on the CME on February 14, trading in the capitulation zone between $60,000 and $70,000, roughly 50% down from its peak, as the network hashrate reaches 894.5 EH/s and energy demands surge to 854,400 kWh per Bitcoin.

Bitcoin price action consolidated around $68,900 on February 14, 2026, trading within a range that historically aligns with the "Year 2" bear phase of Bitcoin's four-year halving cycle, down roughly 50% from peak levels. Earlier in the week on February 11, Bitcoin dropped 3% to $66,000, falling below the critical 200-week exponential moving average at $68,000, while Ethereum declined 3.5% to $1,950. With volatility cooling off, analysts expect price action may stay range-bound and consolidate around current levels, though a move toward the $71,000-$73,000 range looks possible if buyers step back in.

The conversation around Bitcoin's long-term sustainability has shifted from supply shock dynamics to mining viability concerns, as miners now rely more heavily on transaction fees to offset rising energy costs driven by global competition from AI data centers. The network hashrate surged to 894.5 EH/s, increasing the energy required to mine one Bitcoin to approximately 854,400 kWh—meaning daily Bitcoin mining now uses more electricity than the entire country of Belgium over the same 24-hour period. The April 2024 halving reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, pushing miners fully into a post-halving environment where efficiency, electricity costs, and scale determine survival.

The next Bitcoin halving is expected in 2028, cutting block rewards again to 1.5625 BTC, which will further compress margins and drive consolidation toward industrial-scale operations with access to cheap renewable energy. The 20 millionth Bitcoin is projected to be mined in March 2026, leaving only 1 million BTC remaining to be mined over the next century under Bitcoin's fixed supply schedule. Industry observers note that while 2026 continues the post-halving adjustment phase, the increased mining difficulty will squeeze out smaller operators, accelerating centralization trends that could raise long-term network security and decentralization concerns.

## Dedollarisation & US Dollar Trends

### 1. US Dollar Index Falls to 96.88 as Dollar Posts Worst 12-Month Performance Since 2017 - *Feb 13*

> The US Dollar Index (DXY) fell to 96.8817 on February 13, 2026, down 0.04% from the previous session and 9.21% over the past 12 months, marking the dollar's weakest year since 2017 as Fed rate cut expectations and international dynamics weigh on the currency.

The U.S. dollar experienced significant weakness in early February 2026, with the Dollar Index (DXY) falling to 96.8817 on February 13, continuing a sustained decline that has seen the greenback weaken 2.27% over the past month and plunge 9.21% over the last 12 months. The 2025 calendar year marked the dollar's weakest annual performance since 2017, with a decline of 9.7% in the US Dollar Index (DXY), driven by Federal Reserve rate cuts, narrowing interest rate differentials with other major currencies, and growing concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability.

Multiple factors are contributing to ongoing dollar weakness in February 2026, with Fed rate expectations serving as the primary driver. Market participants anticipate gradual USD softness as U.S. interest rates are cut throughout 2026, though periods of dollar strength remain possible if inflation proves sticky or global markets turn cautious. Japanese banking group MUFG projects a decline of around 5% for the US dollar during 2026, while Dutch bank ABN AMRO expects "a significant rise in EURUSD over the next two years" to $1.25 by end-2026 and then to $1.30 by end-2027.

International dynamics have compounded dollar weakness, particularly the yen's sharp appreciation following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's decisive election victory and fresh verbal interventions from Tokyo. Over one week in mid-February, the dollar declined more than 2% against the yen, marking one of the sharpest weekly moves in recent years. The combination of Fed easing expectations, improving economic conditions in Europe and Japan, and diminishing safe-haven demand during periods of market calm has created a challenging environment for dollar bulls, with most forecasts pointing to continued gradual depreciation through 2026 despite likely volatility and periodic rebounds.

### 2. China's Yuan Strengthens Past 6.89 Per Dollar as Xi Pushes "Powerful Currency" Initiative - *Feb 14*

> The offshore yuan strengthened past 6.89 per dollar in mid-February, extending its rally to a sixth straight session and reaching its strongest level since May 2023, as President Xi calls for the RMB to become a "powerful currency" with global reserve status.

The Chinese yuan experienced significant appreciation in mid-February 2026, with the offshore yuan strengthening past 6.89 per dollar, extending its rally to a sixth consecutive session and reaching the strongest level since May 2023. The appreciation reflects China's strategic commitment to currency strength as a pillar of national power, with President Xi Jinping calling for the renminbi to become a "powerful currency" with global reserve currency status and the People's Bank of China indicating a commitment to "slow and orderly" appreciation as it balances export-led growth with currency internationalization goals.

China's foreign exchange reserves increased by $11.5 billion to $3.358 trillion in December 2025, up from $3.346 trillion in November, marking the sixth consecutive monthly rise and the highest level since November 2015. The accumulation was supported by a persistently weaker U.S. dollar and gold price appreciation, with the People's Bank of China continuing to add to its gold holdings for the fifteenth consecutive month in January 2026, reaching 74.19 million fine troy ounces valued at $369.58 billion, up from $319.45 billion a month earlier.

Morgan Stanley projects the yuan will strengthen to 6.85 per U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2026, driven by improving economic fundamentals, capital inflow dynamics, and policy support for currency appreciation. However, Western analysts caution that Xi's yuan internationalization ambitions face substantial structural barriers, including capital controls that limit convertibility, lack of transparent rule of law, and dependence on state-directed credit allocation that reduces confidence compared to dollar and euro alternatives. The yuan's share of global foreign exchange reserves stood at just 1.93% in Q3 2025 according to IMF data, a distant fourth behind the dollar (approximately 57%), euro (roughly 20%), and yen, suggesting the path to reserve currency status remains long despite recent momentum.

### 3. Russia and India Formalize Digital Currency Integration Plans for 2026 BRICS Summit - *Feb 4*

> Russia confirmed plans to integrate its digital ruble with BRICS nations' CBDCs, with the Reserve Bank of India placing "interlinking of CBDCs" on the formal agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit hosted in India, as 90% of Russia-India trade now settles in national currencies.

Russia has confirmed plans to integrate its forthcoming digital ruble with the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) of fellow BRICS nations, with the initiative expected to feature prominently when India hosts the 2026 BRICS summit. The Reserve Bank of India, which has been piloting both retail and wholesale versions of the digital rupee (e₹), has advised the Indian government to place "interlinking of CBDCs" on the formal agenda for the summit, signaling a coordinated push among BRICS members to develop alternatives to dollar-dominated payment infrastructure.

Nearly 90% of direct transactions between India and Russia are now conducted in rubles and rupees, marking a milestone in economic cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi and demonstrating the viability of bilateral trade settlement outside the dollar system. The CBDC integration proposal centers on creating shared payment infrastructure that would allow member states to conduct cross-border trade settlements directly in their sovereign digital currencies, bypassing SWIFT and correspondent banking relationships that have been weaponized through sanctions.

However, the initiative's success depends on critical technical and governance challenges, including ensuring compatibility across different CBDC architectures, establishing governance frameworks for dispute resolution and regulatory oversight, and achieving adoption by commercial banking systems across member states with vastly different financial infrastructure sophistication levels. While Russia and India have demonstrated bilateral success with national currency settlement, scaling this model to encompass the full BRICS+ membership—which now includes diverse economies from Brazil to UAE to Egypt—presents substantially greater complexity and coordination requirements that may limit near-term implementation beyond pilot programs.

### 4. Treasury 10-Year Yield Holds at 4.22% as Debt Tops $38 Trillion and Fiscal Pressures Mount - *Feb 6*

> The 10-year Treasury note yield finished at 4.22% on February 6, within the expected 3.75%-4.25% range for 2026, as U.S. debt surpassed $38 trillion and the federal government borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of fiscal year 2026.

Treasury yields remained relatively stable in early February 2026, with the 10-year note finishing at 4.22% on February 6, while the 2-year note ended at 3.50% and the 30-year note closed at 4.85%, trading within the ranges that market analysts expect to persist throughout 2026. Market forecasts anticipate Treasury yields will remain largely rangebound, with the 10-year Treasury yield fluctuating between 3.75% and 4.25% during 2026 as Federal Reserve rate cuts are offset by fiscal concerns and elevated inflation risks.

Fiscal and debt pressures continue mounting, with U.S. federal debt topping $38 trillion and the government having already borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October 2025. Large and rising fiscal deficits combined with increasing issuance of U.S. Treasuries—as well as debt issuance in other major economies—means that more and more buyers need to step up to help fund government spending at a time when traditional foreign buyers like China and Japan have reduced their Treasury holdings.

The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee met in early February to discuss the composition of Treasury notes and bonds to refund approximately $90.2 billion of privately-held notes and bonds maturing on February 15, 2026. Market analysts expect that ten-year Treasury yields may not fall much below the 3.75% level even as the Fed cuts interest rates, with risk that yields could move back up toward 4.5% at times if inflation proves stickier than anticipated or if foreign demand for U.S. debt continues to wane. The flood of corporate bond issuance driven by the AI infrastructure boom is creating additional competition for investor capital, potentially putting upward pressure on Treasury yields as companies tap debt markets to fund data center construction and semiconductor manufacturing expansion.

### 5. Saudi Arabia Expands Yuan Oil Settlement as Petroyuan Gains Traction Despite Petrodollar Persistence - *Feb 11*

> China and Saudi Arabia signed a $7 billion currency swap agreement enabling direct yuan-riyal settlement, as several countries including Russia, Iran, Venezuela, UAE, and Egypt now use the petroyuan, though analysts forecast decades-long transition from dollar dominance.

China and Saudi Arabia recently signed a $7 billion currency swap agreement that allows direct settlement between the yuan (CNY) and the Saudi riyal (SAR), enabling bilateral trade to be conducted without using the U.S. dollar as an intermediary currency. The agreement marks a significant step in the gradual diversification away from exclusive dollar reliance for oil transactions, though Saudi oil exports are still settled in USD by default, preserving substantial petrodollar demand even as alternatives emerge.

As of January 2025, several countries are using the petroyuan for oil transactions, including Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, China, UAE, and Egypt, representing a meaningful expansion of yuan-based energy settlement beyond countries under U.S. sanctions. However, analysts have noted that yuan-based oil trade faces significant hurdles, with few outlets to spend accumulated RMB reserves and limited depth in yuan-denominated financial markets compared to dollar alternatives. S&P Global forecasts the petroyuan will take decades to scale meaningfully, suggesting the transition away from dollar-dominated energy markets will be gradual rather than abrupt.

Rather than a sudden overthrow of the petrodollar system, the emerging pattern reflects gradual diversification toward a multipolar currency landscape where the dollar maintains dominant but diminished share alongside growing roles for the yuan, euro, and potentially digital currency alternatives. China has successfully pushed for greater yuan-based oil trading with key partners, particularly those seeking to reduce exposure to dollar-based sanctions risks, but a complete replacement of the U.S. dollar remains unlikely in the foreseeable future. The most likely outcome is a multipolar currency system where energy transactions are settled in a basket of currencies chosen based on trade relationships, geopolitical considerations, and currency stability rather than exclusive reliance on any single dominant currency.
